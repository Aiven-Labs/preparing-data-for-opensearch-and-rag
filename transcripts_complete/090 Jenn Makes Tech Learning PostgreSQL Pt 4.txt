you you you you you you you you you you you you you you and re you and the technology you you I muted. That's always fun. A mute tab. Yay, you know, weird way. It is great that I can hear myself That means, you know, if Josh stops by the stream, like half hour into it, I'm at least probably going to have sound. That is improvement. Okay. So, oh my god. Do do do do do do we are going to do some Postgres stuff today and I may or may not have looked into like any of it yet
That means, you know, if Josh stops by the stream, like half hour into it, I'm at least probably going to have sound. That is improvement. Okay. So, oh my god. Do do do do do do we are going to do some Postgres stuff today and I may or may not have looked into like any of it yet I was just like, hey, we're going to get to the computer and then we're going to figure it out. That is that was the motto for today. It's going to be great. Sure. Give me a moment. Make sure I got we got the iPad going. Look. Yay. I do also really need to add that to like my about area
I was just like, hey, we're going to get to the computer and then we're going to figure it out. That is that was the motto for today. It's going to be great. Sure. Give me a moment. Make sure I got we got the iPad going. Look. Yay. I do also really need to add that to like my about area Oh yeah, that is something that I have yet to do is really fill out the like about if you see like some streamers have it like really well filled out and then other people are just like, yeah, whatever. I am working on. I will give there. I will give there
Oh yeah, that is something that I have yet to do is really fill out the like about if you see like some streamers have it like really well filled out and then other people are just like, yeah, whatever. I am working on. I will give there. I will give there I will give there. There's a lot of automation and things that I want to do in life yet the energy and time does not always match it. It's annoying. But I feel like that's just part the human commission. Let's just like everybody. Okay. Let me go. I have notes that I created for last time
I will give there. There's a lot of automation and things that I want to do in life yet the energy and time does not always match it. It's annoying. But I feel like that's just part the human commission. Let's just like everybody. Okay. Let me go. I have notes that I created for last time So let me. I will say y'all like last week was so fun because Dan ended up reading into the stream and then also joined the stream. Yeah. I didn't do anything after that. Like I'm supposed to. I should quit. Quit half. I don't want to say should. I don't like the term should
So let me. I will say y'all like last week was so fun because Dan ended up reading into the stream and then also joined the stream. Yeah. I didn't do anything after that. Like I'm supposed to. I should quit. Quit half. I don't want to say should. I don't like the term should Could have streamed again last week yet I didn't. So here we are doing week four during week five and then I'm off for two weeks. But I feel like we can we can tackle the rest of the to-do list today. So I can start making my actual videos on how to do all of this
Could have streamed again last week yet I didn't. So here we are doing week four during week five and then I'm off for two weeks. But I feel like we can we can tackle the rest of the to-do list today. So I can start making my actual videos on how to do all of this And now I just have to find what I did with all the documentation. Once I do that then I can start sharing my screen. But I see a few are starting to join. So how are you? What are you up to doing anything fun today? Tonight. It doesn't matter where you are in the world this morning
And now I just have to find what I did with all the documentation. Once I do that then I can start sharing my screen. But I see a few are starting to join. So how are you? What are you up to doing anything fun today? Tonight. It doesn't matter where you are in the world this morning Wherever you are. No, I need Postgres learning. Boy, at one point I had I thought I had this mostly figured out. Not always. And as you can tell I probably will have the sniffles today. Which is so annoying. No matter how many allergy pills or anything. I always have the sniffles
Wherever you are. No, I need Postgres learning. Boy, at one point I had I thought I had this mostly figured out. Not always. And as you can tell I probably will have the sniffles today. Which is so annoying. No matter how many allergy pills or anything. I always have the sniffles Let's share it with me. Holy. Here we go. No, not that one. Damn it. Ah, is this it? This is it. And then we are going to do this. Yes. Okay. I don't know if y'all ever do this. But I feel like it is worth sharing
Let's share it with me. Holy. Here we go. No, not that one. Damn it. Ah, is this it? This is it. And then we are going to do this. Yes. Okay. I don't know if y'all ever do this. But I feel like it is worth sharing I was out walking the dog and thinking about how to set this up and just like finding what I'm working on today as part of it is like querying content. And I'm like, I said out loud. Oh, that shouldn't be so hard to figure out
I was out walking the dog and thinking about how to set this up and just like finding what I'm working on today as part of it is like querying content. And I'm like, I said out loud. Oh, that shouldn't be so hard to figure out And I'm like, oh, you can tell a mystery or I just awkwardly talking to myself one or the other. But yeah, that happened. That was cool. I'm glad no one was around. Put it for them embarrassing. But I feel like my neighbors are doing know that. But I do this stuff. Yeah, I don't know
And I'm like, oh, you can tell a mystery or I just awkwardly talking to myself one or the other. But yeah, that happened. That was cool. I'm glad no one was around. Put it for them embarrassing. But I feel like my neighbors are doing know that. But I do this stuff. Yeah, I don't know Yeah, I don't know. Do you do you? Yay. Sniffles, sniffles, sniffles. Come on. I'm sick of these sniffles. Do you do do do do postgres postgres? Okay. No, let's do this. And I will share my screen
Yeah, I don't know. Do you do you? Yay. Sniffles, sniffles, sniffles. Come on. I'm sick of these sniffles. Do you do do do do postgres postgres? Okay. No, let's do this. And I will share my screen And if anyone's curious, I really do need to get on my lighting and work on it and bring some more orange into my life because I promise I am not some weird shade of blue. I'm going to go with I'm going for something for it, you know, it's the new trend. Yeah, let's go with that
And if anyone's curious, I really do need to get on my lighting and work on it and bring some more orange into my life because I promise I am not some weird shade of blue. I'm going to go with I'm going for something for it, you know, it's the new trend. Yeah, let's go with that It's the new trend to be more blue and have blue skin. Blue double. That might be a 90's thing. I don't know. Do you do entire screen? Yeah, I'm glad you got it
It's the new trend to be more blue and have blue skin. Blue double. That might be a 90's thing. I don't know. Do you do entire screen? Yeah, I'm glad you got it I always feel like so silly when I'm like, uh, Did anyone get my reference? Okay, so I worked very hard on cleaning up this document, who said docky sign, which if, over on my iPad, if I'm looking at it, this is basically what we've gone through so far
I always feel like so silly when I'm like, uh, Did anyone get my reference? Okay, so I worked very hard on cleaning up this document, who said docky sign, which if, over on my iPad, if I'm looking at it, this is basically what we've gone through so far And thank you for the follow, I appreciate it. Oh, yes, what was the last impromptu song? Do you ever remember them or is it just like, you never know what radio station you're going to be listening to? This is what we did last week or last few weeks. And I feel, oh, I need to put notes on here
And thank you for the follow, I appreciate it. Oh, yes, what was the last impromptu song? Do you ever remember them or is it just like, you never know what radio station you're going to be listening to? This is what we did last week or last few weeks. And I feel, oh, I need to put notes on here Yes, okay. So I have before this, like, give you some background. I have been in the tech world or tech adjacent, almost my entire career. I was tech sales, I was tech support, I worked in a call center, I worked at GoDaddy, I worked, you know, I tried video production for a hot minute
Yes, okay. So I have before this, like, give you some background. I have been in the tech world or tech adjacent, almost my entire career. I was tech sales, I was tech support, I worked in a call center, I worked at GoDaddy, I worked, you know, I tried video production for a hot minute I've been around data and tech. What I didn't realize was how hard it would be to set up locally for Postgres. And I'm doing something a little new on a lot of my show. There are people that come on and teach me about the tech. Well, I decided that with Postgres, I'm just going to wing it
I've been around data and tech. What I didn't realize was how hard it would be to set up locally for Postgres. And I'm doing something a little new on a lot of my show. There are people that come on and teach me about the tech. Well, I decided that with Postgres, I'm just going to wing it And we're just going to see what I can figure out. Oh, that happens. I talk with my hands and head buttons with my pen. And yeah, so that's what happened first week one week two was a bit of a struggle. But we got there. Luckily, it was nor was there
And we're just going to see what I can figure out. Oh, that happens. I talk with my hands and head buttons with my pen. And yeah, so that's what happened first week one week two was a bit of a struggle. But we got there. Luckily, it was nor was there And then also week three was a lot of, I don't know, that didn't, that didn't really work. And then week four is what we're doing today. So and. Oh. Was it the Katy Perry firework then? Because I was listening to the champion one. Oh, what are you doing with Postgres? Did you? Sure
And then also week three was a lot of, I don't know, that didn't, that didn't really work. And then week four is what we're doing today. So and. Oh. Was it the Katy Perry firework then? Because I was listening to the champion one. Oh, what are you doing with Postgres? Did you? Sure And if anybody wants a amusement, here is the playlist to hang out. Oh, nice. Oh, sweet. I'm guessing that is live on GitHub. It's. I think I'm part of that discord part of that discord. I don't even know where discord is on my computer right now
And if anybody wants a amusement, here is the playlist to hang out. Oh, nice. Oh, sweet. I'm guessing that is live on GitHub. It's. I think I'm part of that discord part of that discord. I don't even know where discord is on my computer right now And there it is too many windows on top of each other. Oh, yay. Well, I don't know. Oh. Am I on the like streamers thing? That's cool. That's exciting. I don't know is I. I join a lot of discord. Okay, let me say that. I joined a discord because like somebody is super cool
And there it is too many windows on top of each other. Oh, yay. Well, I don't know. Oh. Am I on the like streamers thing? That's cool. That's exciting. I don't know is I. I join a lot of discord. Okay, let me say that. I joined a discord because like somebody is super cool And I'm like, I want to be a part of your discord. That's awesome. And then. I like get lost of like, oh, there's so many people. I don't know who to talk to them and really overwhelm. So I just end up sitting sticking to my open source rate guilds with Jacob. Oh, yay. Hey, that's cool
And I'm like, I want to be a part of your discord. That's awesome. And then. I like get lost of like, oh, there's so many people. I don't know who to talk to them and really overwhelm. So I just end up sitting sticking to my open source rate guilds with Jacob. Oh, yay. Hey, that's cool Hey, that's cool. Well, fancy. Thank you. Okay. Well, I'm glad that I know that I was a part of that discord because I'm like, that sounds awfully familiar. Or wonderfully familiar. I'm not sure how you would say that. But that is okay. I'm not sure if you're going to be friends with me. All right
Hey, that's cool. Well, fancy. Thank you. Okay. Well, I'm glad that I know that I was a part of that discord because I'm like, that sounds awfully familiar. Or wonderfully familiar. I'm not sure how you would say that. But that is okay. I'm not sure if you're going to be friends with me. All right All right. Postgres. You and I are going to be friends. It's going to happen. Oh, yes. A lot of people. I talk a lot about mental health and neurodiversity as well, especially in tech. And a lot of people have asked me, they're like, Jen, do you have a discord? And I'm like, no
All right. Postgres. You and I are going to be friends. It's going to happen. Oh, yes. A lot of people. I talk a lot about mental health and neurodiversity as well, especially in tech. And a lot of people have asked me, they're like, Jen, do you have a discord? And I'm like, no No, no, I'm not going to. It's not going to happen. I don't want to have my own discord. I get lost enough having everybody else's discord. But as that being said, since I hang out in open source rate guild, they mentioned that I might be able to have like my own like little channels
No, no, I'm not going to. It's not going to happen. I don't want to have my own discord. I get lost enough having everybody else's discord. But as that being said, since I hang out in open source rate guild, they mentioned that I might be able to have like my own like little channels Like that could be cool. But I get to still hang out with people. Okay. I need to actually do this. No. And I don't know if anybody else goes through this where it's like. You're, you first go into a product and you're like, I don't want to start this. I don't want to start this
Like that could be cool. But I get to still hang out with people. Okay. I need to actually do this. No. And I don't know if anybody else goes through this where it's like. You're, you first go into a product and you're like, I don't want to start this. I don't want to start this It's like a struggle to start. And then it's like, okay, cool. Like I'm a few minutes into it. I'm good. That is how I am at least every single time. It's fine. It's fine. Totally okay. And we're going to cheat and look at my notes and see what I did. Uh, did it. Yes, yes. Six days ago, bananas
It's like a struggle to start. And then it's like, okay, cool. Like I'm a few minutes into it. I'm good. That is how I am at least every single time. It's fine. It's fine. Totally okay. And we're going to cheat and look at my notes and see what I did. Uh, did it. Yes, yes. Six days ago, bananas Oh, I actually just started using Docker for this project. I started working goodness. Oh, my gosh, it's been 60 days. Oh, that's so weird. I started working at a data infrastructure company called Ivan. And part of my job is going to be to create the get started videos for. This for Postgres for
Oh, I actually just started using Docker for this project. I started working goodness. Oh, my gosh, it's been 60 days. Oh, that's so weird. I started working at a data infrastructure company called Ivan. And part of my job is going to be to create the get started videos for. This for Postgres for Redis and for my sequel. I'm like, I don't know any of them. So I am learning them. And Docker was the first place I second place I tried learning them as the reason that it says. Local. Now. And yes, Ramon, you weren't here at the very beginning, but I even said thanks for the title. Idea
Redis and for my sequel. I'm like, I don't know any of them. So I am learning them. And Docker was the first place I second place I tried learning them as the reason that it says. Local. Now. And yes, Ramon, you weren't here at the very beginning, but I even said thanks for the title. Idea Idea. So I think that's just what I'm going to do when I'm like learning doing something by myself. Jen makes tech learning blah, blah, blah. But the rest of the time, if it's a guest, then it can be teach. That's what I'm going with. And. He did add imports and log in. Please keep me log in
Idea. So I think that's just what I'm going to do when I'm like learning doing something by myself. Jen makes tech learning blah, blah, blah. But the rest of the time, if it's a guest, then it can be teach. That's what I'm going with. And. He did add imports and log in. Please keep me log in Please keep me log in. Thank you. Oh. You got to go upgrade. I don't want to think about this. I think I should probably write a thing about this. Agreed. Agreed. It is always pleasant when you don't have to sign in every time. It kind of reminds me of my stream yesterday about APIs
Please keep me log in. Thank you. Oh. You got to go upgrade. I don't want to think about this. I think I should probably write a thing about this. Agreed. Agreed. It is always pleasant when you don't have to sign in every time. It kind of reminds me of my stream yesterday about APIs When you don't have to do the handshake every single time. Not the same thing, but loosely related ideas. I don't know. I mean, take what. I don't need to update it. We. Can. I don't know if I like clicked out of this. Way too much. Or. I'm looking over here
When you don't have to do the handshake every single time. Not the same thing, but loosely related ideas. I don't know. I mean, take what. I don't need to update it. We. Can. I don't know if I like clicked out of this. Way too much. Or. I'm looking over here And it says download, maintainer, Docker container, P.D. Admin. It's available at Docker Hub. See instructions for Docker Hub. Yes, I am reading these out loud. So that way I hopefully don't skip words. Okay. KG Admin for. Of a. A. Ramon, I blame you
And it says download, maintainer, Docker container, P.D. Admin. It's available at Docker Hub. See instructions for Docker Hub. Yes, I am reading these out loud. So that way I hopefully don't skip words. Okay. KG Admin for. Of a. A. Ramon, I blame you Ramon, I blame you. Since you were one of my first guests, it was a lot of like. I was like, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were like, you. Yeah, it helps to read the comments out loud. Although I will say now that I only streamed one area, I don't read the comments out loud. Because I'm like, yeah
Ramon, I blame you. Since you were one of my first guests, it was a lot of like. I was like, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were like, you. Yeah, it helps to read the comments out loud. Although I will say now that I only streamed one area, I don't read the comments out loud. Because I'm like, yeah People should be able to see what others are saying. Because it's all in one area. Unless it's like super funny or important. I'm not sure if I can do it. Yes, I do. Um, we're going to see if I can break some stuff. No, okay. Ah, have I tried bionic reading thing? I've seen it. I haven't. What's
People should be able to see what others are saying. Because it's all in one area. Unless it's like super funny or important. I'm not sure if I can do it. Yes, I do. Um, we're going to see if I can break some stuff. No, okay. Ah, have I tried bionic reading thing? I've seen it. I haven't. What's I haven't. What's. It sounds more interesting than me trying to unfigure, figure this out. So I'll allow the distraction. The distraction. Like I've seen things about it. I haven't actually gone to try it yet. Or I just broke the website. Go back. You don't want to know
I haven't. What's. It sounds more interesting than me trying to unfigure, figure this out. So I'll allow the distraction. The distraction. Like I've seen things about it. I haven't actually gone to try it yet. Or I just broke the website. Go back. You don't want to know So we'll try something else. How to geek. Oh, um. Let's see. It's not bad. I, um, I will say I don't know. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. Like this is a variation of it. Yeah, I would say at least for this one as I was reading through it
So we'll try something else. How to geek. Oh, um. Let's see. It's not bad. I, um, I will say I don't know. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. Like this is a variation of it. Yeah, I would say at least for this one as I was reading through it I still noticed that I skipped like this center, complete the world. And I skipped to bionic reading. But it does make it a lot easier reading line by line or like across the line. I can do it. Okay. So when I like that bionic reading definitely did help me go like from here to here
I still noticed that I skipped like this center, complete the world. And I skipped to bionic reading. But it does make it a lot easier reading line by line or like across the line. I can do it. Okay. So when I like that bionic reading definitely did help me go like from here to here Where normally I go from here to here to here to here to here kind of here. And I still skip lines. So really not loud. I at least have to like do my best not skip another one. I don't know why it helps so much, but it does. It's just embarrassing when I don't know how to sound something out
Where normally I go from here to here to here to here to here kind of here. And I still skip lines. So really not loud. I at least have to like do my best not skip another one. I don't know why it helps so much, but it does. It's just embarrassing when I don't know how to sound something out But that is part of learning my extreme. It's the fun part. I can't. I have to update. PG admin. For on doctor container steps. Can you. Can you please place the thing locked this click here? Me. One time
But that is part of learning my extreme. It's the fun part. I can't. I have to update. PG admin. For on doctor container steps. Can you. Can you please place the thing locked this click here? Me. One time One time. You're not very way to structure it tomorrow you'll have an an galleryians corner after Trump machine. There's a video. Maybe I'll watch it really quick. See if it helps. Playback speed. Yeah. Oh no, it's just installing. I want to update. It says the same thing. What do you? Okay
One time. You're not very way to structure it tomorrow you'll have an an galleryians corner after Trump machine. There's a video. Maybe I'll watch it really quick. See if it helps. Playback speed. Yeah. Oh no, it's just installing. I want to update. It says the same thing. What do you? Okay What do you? Okay. Why do we have to update it? Oh, you're good. I mean, that's part of the fun of streaming. I am not a happy camper about having to figure out how to update. That is part of the process. Yay. Hey. Hey. Oh, it helps if I actually share. Yeah
What do you? Okay. Why do we have to update it? Oh, you're good. I mean, that's part of the fun of streaming. I am not a happy camper about having to figure out how to update. That is part of the process. Yay. Hey. Hey. Oh, it helps if I actually share. Yeah Yeah. I'm probably going to be easier this way this time. Yes. Yes. That is why I take notes. Yes, they're handwritten notes, but that is a big reason I take notes. I don't know. How did I do that? I don't remember. You know what? I'm just. Oh, that is a good call. That is a good call
Yeah. I'm probably going to be easier this way this time. Yes. Yes. That is why I take notes. Yes, they're handwritten notes, but that is a big reason I take notes. I don't know. How did I do that? I don't remember. You know what? I'm just. Oh, that is a good call. That is a good call I'm also thinking about. I'm going to be doing for work or using the trial. So I'm almost wondering because it wouldn't be using a darker in the jump. But that'd be easier. I wonder. No, no, no, I'm going to go try it. I'll just sidetracked myself and see if I can do the rest of it over there
I'm also thinking about. I'm going to be doing for work or using the trial. So I'm almost wondering because it wouldn't be using a darker in the jump. But that'd be easier. I wonder. No, no, no, I'm going to go try it. I'll just sidetracked myself and see if I can do the rest of it over there Goodbye, doctor. I do not like you. Goodbye. Let's see. Be the ee. Find over here. Get side of her free. Sign up with Google. I have too many email addresses. Oh, well, something about on here is really quick as like a side note. If I do. If I handwrite your name, this is it's supposed to happen
Goodbye, doctor. I do not like you. Goodbye. Let's see. Be the ee. Find over here. Get side of her free. Sign up with Google. I have too many email addresses. Oh, well, something about on here is really quick as like a side note. If I do. If I handwrite your name, this is it's supposed to happen If I go to like the main area, it's supposed to be. We'll find out if this actually happens. Let me make this bigger again. So I wrote your name. And now I'm going to go search. And it shows up one match. And it highlights it. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah. It's so cool
If I go to like the main area, it's supposed to be. We'll find out if this actually happens. Let me make this bigger again. So I wrote your name. And now I'm going to go search. And it shows up one match. And it highlights it. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah. It's so cool Yeah. It's so cool. I'm going to erase your name though, because that's what's going to be weird. What about this person or name? I don't remember when I look at it in like three months. Okay. Yay. Oh, oh, I wonder if I'm not going to be able to create the free service. Let's see. AWS
Yeah. It's so cool. I'm going to erase your name though, because that's what's going to be weird. What about this person or name? I don't remember when I look at it in like three months. Okay. Yay. Oh, oh, I wonder if I'm not going to be able to create the free service. Let's see. AWS Let's see. AWS. I am in North America. And. We can be central. That's fine. We're going to do name this thing. What do we name this learning? Rose Grace. We will do that. Great free service. Yay. Thank you. Thank you. Goodness gracious. Um. Oh, there's a lot. Okay. Secure connection. Whoa
Let's see. AWS. I am in North America. And. We can be central. That's fine. We're going to do name this thing. What do we name this learning? Rose Grace. We will do that. Great free service. Yay. Thank you. Thank you. Goodness gracious. Um. Oh, there's a lot. Okay. Secure connection. Whoa Whoa. Well, hello, hello, Robert. Thanks for joining. I'm going to go back to this really quick. So that way you can see. Do you do you. I can zoom this in a bit. So week one. I, well, I've been learning PG. Wait, postgres. It's. Oh, yeah. Anything that I do on my stream
Whoa. Well, hello, hello, Robert. Thanks for joining. I'm going to go back to this really quick. So that way you can see. Do you do you. I can zoom this in a bit. So week one. I, well, I've been learning PG. Wait, postgres. It's. Oh, yeah. Anything that I do on my stream I'm going to redo for other things. Like, I'm going to do a lot of things. I'm going to do a lot of things. Thank goodness. I'm setting up postgres. And I'm learning it without ever doing anything. So the first step was week one. Trying to set up locally. That was absolute shit. It was painful
I'm going to redo for other things. Like, I'm going to do a lot of things. I'm going to do a lot of things. Thank goodness. I'm setting up postgres. And I'm learning it without ever doing anything. So the first step was week one. Trying to set up locally. That was absolute shit. It was painful It was painful. It was a very painful time in my life. Then week two. Let's try Docker. Okay. Let's do it. We will try Docker. Let's try it. Okay. I'm going to do a security connection. Manager users and permissions and create schemas. Which I got stuck on step number one of week three
It was painful. It was a very painful time in my life. Then week two. Let's try Docker. Okay. Let's do it. We will try Docker. Let's try it. Okay. I'm going to do a security connection. Manager users and permissions and create schemas. Which I got stuck on step number one of week three It was kind of. Yeah. And I have been taking notes on what I've been doing to get to where I'm at. Yet questions. Questions. Look at this. Does secure connection mean SSL? I'm going to do a security connection. I'm going to do a security connection. I'm going to do a security connection
It was kind of. Yeah. And I have been taking notes on what I've been doing to get to where I'm at. Yet questions. Questions. Look at this. Does secure connection mean SSL? I'm going to do a security connection. I'm going to do a security connection. I'm going to do a security connection Because I couldn't like find what it was looking for. And. I logged into PG admin today through my doctor instance. And it's like, yo bro, you need upgrade
Because I couldn't like find what it was looking for. And. I logged into PG admin today through my doctor instance. And it's like, yo bro, you need upgrade And everything that it was saying was all the Googles were basically saying, hey, to upgrade your instance and for PG admin, you have to delete the old one. And you can't do that. I'm not going to do that again
And everything that it was saying was all the Googles were basically saying, hey, to upgrade your instance and for PG admin, you have to delete the old one. And you can't do that. I'm not going to do that again So why not go set it up on Ivan? Since we have the free tier now, why not? I need to learn postgres overall. Might as well make it easier on myself and see like compare it. This is my own mind and connection. And. This this step that I got very stuck on. For the darker one. And I'm like, literally
So why not go set it up on Ivan? Since we have the free tier now, why not? I need to learn postgres overall. Might as well make it easier on myself and see like compare it. This is my own mind and connection. And. This this step that I got very stuck on. For the darker one. And I'm like, literally Just really easy right here. What? What? How? I did ask like between my dreams, something that's really cool about the team I work with is they all know that I'm a new about this
Just really easy right here. What? What? How? I did ask like between my dreams, something that's really cool about the team I work with is they all know that I'm a new about this And so I'll ask some questions, especially like, hey, is this like a PG admin type thing? Like because I'm new in an on Docker or is it because like how was it on Ivan? And from what I understand is that Ivan would automatically secure the connection
And so I'll ask some questions, especially like, hey, is this like a PG admin type thing? Like because I'm new in an on Docker or is it because like how was it on Ivan? And from what I understand is that Ivan would automatically secure the connection I am curious like how railway does it because I did Anthony Campolo did show me that it's even railway is pretty easy to set up to. Let's stick this to skip this step. Oh, hey. We can migrate or sample data. Let's skip this step. Oh, there's extensions and things. I don't know what those mean yet
I am curious like how railway does it because I did Anthony Campolo did show me that it's even railway is pretty easy to set up to. Let's stick this to skip this step. Oh, hey. We can migrate or sample data. Let's skip this step. Oh, there's extensions and things. I don't know what those mean yet So we will skip that. And yes, I may be excited about PG admin because of the elephants. Don't judge. Thanks. Okay. So. Oh, you can just like upgrade the version there. Is it. Thank you. Thank you. And do I say I should ask do you say it Joe Daba? Jada. I'm really bad at these
So we will skip that. And yes, I may be excited about PG admin because of the elephants. Don't judge. Thanks. Okay. So. Oh, you can just like upgrade the version there. Is it. Thank you. Thank you. And do I say I should ask do you say it Joe Daba? Jada. I'm really bad at these SSL secure socket layer is the encryption protocol. And we now have TLS, which is a bit better, but everybody calls it SSL still. Even though it's not always actually SSL things get confusing really fast on the security front. I call it job security. Yeah, yeah, I did it. I did it
SSL secure socket layer is the encryption protocol. And we now have TLS, which is a bit better, but everybody calls it SSL still. Even though it's not always actually SSL things get confusing really fast on the security front. I call it job security. Yeah, yeah, I did it. I did it I did it. Yes, that is the happiest news. Well, Joe Daba. It's going to go with what I'm going with now. I completely agree on the SSL stuff. It was very confusing. Looking how to secure it and even looking to. Look this up in like PG admin
I did it. Yes, that is the happiest news. Well, Joe Daba. It's going to go with what I'm going with now. I completely agree on the SSL stuff. It was very confusing. Looking how to secure it and even looking to. Look this up in like PG admin I think this is going to boot me out because I killed it on Docker. Yeah, you're not even going to work. That's fine. Leafs say yes, please. Okay. Yes, close out of all of this. Close. So many things close. Close. Yay. Uh, quick. Oh, PC. CLI. PGI, man. What? I'm not going to work
I think this is going to boot me out because I killed it on Docker. Yeah, you're not even going to work. That's fine. Leafs say yes, please. Okay. Yes, close out of all of this. Close. So many things close. Close. Yay. Uh, quick. Oh, PC. CLI. PGI, man. What? I'm not going to work Oh, yeah, for sure. Thank you for the suggestion. Look. Ramon, this is like the first time I'm actually like fully going into like checking out the I'm stuff. So that's why I'm like, whoa, it does this. That's really cool. Like it was really difficult to go going at the last like three streams
Oh, yeah, for sure. Thank you for the suggestion. Look. Ramon, this is like the first time I'm actually like fully going into like checking out the I'm stuff. So that's why I'm like, whoa, it does this. That's really cool. Like it was really difficult to go going at the last like three streams And just being able to SSL mode require SSL. Just on. And we can do a quick connect. Oh, I was just saying that it like. It just does the things. It does things. And without me realizing that it does things like easily. Ah, sorry. By the way, I have ads turned off. I don't know why it's still
And just being able to SSL mode require SSL. Just on. And we can do a quick connect. Oh, I was just saying that it like. It just does the things. It does things. And without me realizing that it does things like easily. Ah, sorry. By the way, I have ads turned off. I don't know why it's still I'm not going to work. Oh, maybe. I need to delete this one. Delete service. I'm deleting my old services that I had on here when I was applying. I'm going to get to my single someday. We're not there today. I need. So you should go away. The lane information. That's fine
I'm not going to work. Oh, maybe. I need to delete this one. Delete service. I'm deleting my old services that I had on here when I was applying. I'm going to get to my single someday. We're not there today. I need. So you should go away. The lane information. That's fine That's fine. You don't need a payment method. Okay. So. If we're here. Oh, there's queries and users and databases. We need to create a new database. Users are so much easier. What is this? Okay. So. I feel like I should not be this excited about it. That it's just like. Seems very simple. Okay
That's fine. You don't need a payment method. Okay. So. If we're here. Oh, there's queries and users and databases. We need to create a new database. Users are so much easier. What is this? Okay. So. I feel like I should not be this excited about it. That it's just like. Seems very simple. Okay Okay. So I'm going to quick connect. I'm choosing PG admin. Connect. I then to be. Post SQL database with PG admin. You can easily import a new database connections to you. PG admin with a JSON file. Open PG admin and click tools. Remote. You might know this one
Okay. So I'm going to quick connect. I'm choosing PG admin. Connect. I then to be. Post SQL database with PG admin. You can easily import a new database connections to you. PG admin with a JSON file. Open PG admin and click tools. Remote. You might know this one Does let me know I need to have PG admin on my computer. I'm going to have a new computer. I'm going to have a new computer. Wait, I think I did. Do I? Are you? Maybe. What just happened? Oh, it took a minute. That is what happened. I'm waiting for PG admin for it to start. Insects at that
Does let me know I need to have PG admin on my computer. I'm going to have a new computer. I'm going to have a new computer. Wait, I think I did. Do I? Are you? Maybe. What just happened? Oh, it took a minute. That is what happened. I'm waiting for PG admin for it to start. Insects at that Insects at that. Oh, you guys can't see my master password. That's not for you. That's for me. Okay. Okay. Okay. No. Please don't tell me you're going to make me install again. I'm going to just update yourself, bro. Like, come on. Okay. Click here for more information. And I'm not
Insects at that. Oh, you guys can't see my master password. That's not for you. That's for me. Okay. Okay. Okay. No. Please don't tell me you're going to make me install again. I'm going to just update yourself, bro. Like, come on. Okay. Click here for more information. And I'm not And I'm not. Why doesn't it just update by itself? I'm going to have to uninstall and reinstall. Will it replace itself? Yes. Yes. I call a lot of things, bro. I don't know if that's good thing or not. I'm going to have to do it. I'm going to have to do it. See, look, this is odd
And I'm not. Why doesn't it just update by itself? I'm going to have to uninstall and reinstall. Will it replace itself? Yes. Yes. I call a lot of things, bro. I don't know if that's good thing or not. I'm going to have to do it. I'm going to have to do it. See, look, this is odd Just because we've talked about having to move things to applications. This one doesn't even have you move it to applications. Yes, I want to open it. Please load. This is going to make me have different instances. I'm going to replace my current one. Replace the current one. Replace it. Go. Fine
Just because we've talked about having to move things to applications. This one doesn't even have you move it to applications. Yes, I want to open it. Please load. This is going to make me have different instances. I'm going to replace my current one. Replace the current one. Replace it. Go. Fine Go. Fine. Fine. There we go. Leave. This is the really fun part about streaming. When you have to reset everything and reset stuff up. I'm going to have to do it. I'm going to have to do it. Yeah. We're alone when we were talking about querying stuff earlier. I am excited, not excited
Go. Fine. Fine. There we go. Leave. This is the really fun part about streaming. When you have to reset everything and reset stuff up. I'm going to have to do it. I'm going to have to do it. Yeah. We're alone when we were talking about querying stuff earlier. I am excited, not excited I will tell you that. I'm excited. Technical difficulties, bro. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. Hopefully. Or Jen, click me, click me too much. Oh, I don't need stack builder. Actually. Thanks, but no. Thanks. I don't need you at the moment. Yes, I want to exit you. I'm going to exit you
I will tell you that. I'm excited. Technical difficulties, bro. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. Hopefully. Or Jen, click me, click me too much. Oh, I don't need stack builder. Actually. Thanks, but no. Thanks. I don't need you at the moment. Yes, I want to exit you. I'm going to exit you I'm going to exit you. Proper one. Well, you know, I've tried it a few times. That's about it. So we'll learn together. It'll be fun. As soon as. Oh, why are you opening on this other window? That's rude. Do you like the colors? It's pretty. Yeah. You know, please start. Please be magic. Yay
I'm going to exit you. Proper one. Well, you know, I've tried it a few times. That's about it. So we'll learn together. It'll be fun. As soon as. Oh, why are you opening on this other window? That's rude. Do you like the colors? It's pretty. Yeah. You know, please start. Please be magic. Yay Yay. Are you literally just did this? Okay. Early. There we go. And there we go. Okay. So we have PG. That is great. We are getting somewhere. So I'm not. I'm not. Please. Thank you. So what I'm going to do really quick. Let's move this out of the way. I'm going to zoom in. I'm going to zoom in
Yay. Are you literally just did this? Okay. Early. There we go. And there we go. Okay. So we have PG. That is great. We are getting somewhere. So I'm not. I'm not. Please. Thank you. So what I'm going to do really quick. Let's move this out of the way. I'm going to zoom in. I'm going to zoom in There we go. You're just going to be an awkward size somewhere. I'll just zoom you in really. Really a lot. Yeah. That's. That's some good English. Really a lot. Okay. And. So if I'm taking a look at my notes, I'm just crossing out
There we go. You're just going to be an awkward size somewhere. I'll just zoom you in really. Really a lot. Yeah. That's. That's some good English. Really a lot. Okay. And. So if I'm taking a look at my notes, I'm just crossing out And it's all of my instructions on like steps I've taken for setting it up on. Docker. Like I was following all this and. It wasn't me. My friend. It wanted to uninstall and reinstall stuff. So. You had to set up a night. So step number one. Cross this out. I did not do that
And it's all of my instructions on like steps I've taken for setting it up on. Docker. Like I was following all this and. It wasn't me. My friend. It wanted to uninstall and reinstall stuff. So. You had to set up a night. So step number one. Cross this out. I did not do that I did not do that. And step number two is... E-I-V-N, create... E-V-N, count. That was pretty easy. And... I need to write down my, oh, two zoomed in now. Unzumin, thank you, thank you. And then we went through all those steps. I basically just take next, next, next. And now we are on..
I did not do that. And step number two is... E-I-V-N, create... E-V-N, count. That was pretty easy. And... I need to write down my, oh, two zoomed in now. Unzumin, thank you, thank you. And then we went through all those steps. I basically just take next, next, next. And now we are on.... Get started. Oh. Oh, wrong one. Oh, quick-knit. Okay. Quick. Connect. And it says... Open TG admin. And... Import export servers. Okay, cool. I will say that considering this is my steps from last time, it seems a lot easier to do in... Ivan. Just because... Like..
.. Get started. Oh. Oh, wrong one. Oh, quick-knit. Okay. Quick. Connect. And it says... Open TG admin. And... Import export servers. Okay, cool. I will say that considering this is my steps from last time, it seems a lot easier to do in... Ivan. Just because... Like.... Like... I didn't have to set up Docker. I did have to set up the same account. So... We'll say... Meal, thank you. Since I'm gonna write a little bit, I will do this. It was... Account... Set up... We're the same. But I didn't have to install Docker
.. Like... I didn't have to set up Docker. I did have to set up the same account. So... We'll say... Meal, thank you. Since I'm gonna write a little bit, I will do this. It was... Account... Set up... We're the same. But I didn't have to install Docker Like I had to install Docker, but not install Ivan. And then install PostgreSQL on Docker. Nope, didn't have to do. Yay. And set up... Client. Okay. That is where we're on. That's gonna be fun. Let's go try it. Give me that. Can you zoom in? Well, you can. Yay. Okay. So, quick-knit. Quick-knit
Like I had to install Docker, but not install Ivan. And then install PostgreSQL on Docker. Nope, didn't have to do. Yay. And set up... Client. Okay. That is where we're on. That's gonna be fun. Let's go try it. Give me that. Can you zoom in? Well, you can. Yay. Okay. So, quick-knit. Quick-knit Quick-knit. Connect. Pretty JSON file. Click Tools. That means I have to find Tools. Passes as SQL. Oh, up there. That does make sense. Import. Import. Import. PgConnect. But... JSON. Yeah, we're gonna remove everything since... This is our first one in here. That's it. Next. Oh
Quick-knit. Connect. Pretty JSON file. Click Tools. That means I have to find Tools. Passes as SQL. Oh, up there. That does make sense. Import. Import. Import. PgConnect. But... JSON. Yeah, we're gonna remove everything since... This is our first one in here. That's it. Next. Oh Next. Oh. Oh, because I can't see everything. That would help. Hmm. Oh. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's fine. So... This doesn't even get there anywhere. Uh, no. Come back. Oh, there you are. Just stop. Okay. Okay. Okay. And we are going to... Do... New folder. Learn Postgres. And... And.
Next. Oh. Oh, because I can't see everything. That would help. Hmm. Oh. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's fine. So... This doesn't even get there anywhere. Uh, no. Come back. Oh, there you are. Just stop. Okay. Okay. Okay. And we are going to... Do... New folder. Learn Postgres. And... And. And... And... Good. Oh, yes, that's not what I actually wanted. I wanted hyper. Yes. Oh, my goodness. All the updates. At least this one's... Faster. And less. Learn Postgres. Meet. CD. Learn. Postgres. Oh, that. Yay. We need a new file. It needs to... See what... PgConnect.json. PgConnect.json
And... And... Good. Oh, yes, that's not what I actually wanted. I wanted hyper. Yes. Oh, my goodness. All the updates. At least this one's... Faster. And less. Learn Postgres. Meet. CD. Learn. Postgres. Oh, that. Yay. We need a new file. It needs to... See what... PgConnect.json. PgConnect.json PgConnect.json. Ta-da! Yay. Paste. Sweet, safe. You can edit the variable name. And group name. Hmm. Name. KD1. You're enough for me. All right. He'll be back to PDF and we then want to go to... Tools, Import. Go find this thing. Uh... Stop. Code. Name. Postgres. This.json. Yay
PgConnect.json. Ta-da! Yay. Paste. Sweet, safe. You can edit the variable name. And group name. Hmm. Name. KD1. You're enough for me. All right. He'll be back to PDF and we then want to go to... Tools, Import. Go find this thing. Uh... Stop. Code. Name. Postgres. This.json. Yay This.json. Yay. And yes, delete everything that's... We're not using. Select group service. Yay. Summary. And then we'll go to the... ...Code. Please connect the selected server to the view in the dashboard. Uh... Do, do, do, do. Do, do, do. Oh
This.json. Yay. And yes, delete everything that's... We're not using. Select group service. Yay. Summary. And then we'll go to the... ...Code. Please connect the selected server to the view in the dashboard. Uh... Do, do, do, do. Do, do, do. Oh Do, do, do. Oh. It's a really good thing that I'm not going to be using this for everything, because yeah, I'm showing passwords on. On stream. You're not supposed to do that, y'all. Just as the heads up. I, on the other hand, am not worrying about it because I am learning all of this live
Do, do, do. Oh. It's a really good thing that I'm not going to be using this for everything, because yeah, I'm showing passwords on. On stream. You're not supposed to do that, y'all. Just as the heads up. I, on the other hand, am not worrying about it because I am learning all of this live So when I go to make things, it won't. Oh, well. Y'all, this is even... I feel like this is even easier than... ...when I installed it through Docker, like even the PG admin looks easier. I don't know. We could be making things up. I will go verify. Okay. So... Do I have a favorite animal? Yes
So when I go to make things, it won't. Oh, well. Y'all, this is even... I feel like this is even easier than... ...when I installed it through Docker, like even the PG admin looks easier. I don't know. We could be making things up. I will go verify. Okay. So... Do I have a favorite animal? Yes It's one of the reasons why I love Postgres. It's the animal. A Postgres. Now, now you got to knowledge check yourself. Do you know what that animal is? Um... Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh. PG admin... Uh... I don't even know what that is
It's one of the reasons why I love Postgres. It's the animal. A Postgres. Now, now you got to knowledge check yourself. Do you know what that animal is? Um... Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh. PG admin... Uh... I don't even know what that is Is that a type of elephant? I hope this isn't going to be a bad Google. Oh, my God, those are cute. Those are cute. But no, you know what I really want is a... Uh... What are they? Giant rodent. Yes. Copybarra. Look at these things. Yes. Yes, I want one. Look at them. They're cute. They're cutly
Is that a type of elephant? I hope this isn't going to be a bad Google. Oh, my God, those are cute. Those are cute. But no, you know what I really want is a... Uh... What are they? Giant rodent. Yes. Copybarra. Look at these things. Yes. Yes, I want one. Look at them. They're cute. They're cutly They're cutly. They're cute and cutly. And they're big. Yeah, big. I want one. I went down a Google rabbit hole one day and found out about all this stuff. And they're really cute. And they can like be really mean and vicious, but, um... They're normally very cute and very friendly. Yes. Yes. So..
They're cutly. They're cute and cutly. And they're big. Yeah, big. I want one. I went down a Google rabbit hole one day and found out about all this stuff. And they're really cute. And they can like be really mean and vicious, but, um... They're normally very cute and very friendly. Yes. Yes. So.. Yes. Yes. So... Everyone should get one of these. Okay. Back to notes. We imported it to PG Admin. I don't think there's anything else I need to do to connect them. No, we are caught up. Yo, I got caught up switching over to Ivan. What took me like... Like 12 hours to do previously
Yes. Yes. So... Everyone should get one of these. Okay. Back to notes. We imported it to PG Admin. I don't think there's anything else I need to do to connect them. No, we are caught up. Yo, I got caught up switching over to Ivan. What took me like... Like 12 hours to do previously We did it in an hour to get caught up to this point. Yes. What up, Allison? How's it going? Thank you for joining us. We are setting up postgres. And gonna try to do some things. Currently... This is what we're looking at. Uh, in this handy-dandy corner is... Load some data. Yo, what? I hate this
We did it in an hour to get caught up to this point. Yes. What up, Allison? How's it going? Thank you for joining us. We are setting up postgres. And gonna try to do some things. Currently... This is what we're looking at. Uh, in this handy-dandy corner is... Load some data. Yo, what? I hate this E. Yeah, maybe that'll work if I just keep it in the corner. I don't know. Uh, no, no, no. So... Let's go. Try to find... Right? I was like, I need to find sample data. Yumple, data. Four. Postgres. SQL. Oh. Uh, postgres is one of those words you hear. You get bored. I will say... Okay. It's..
E. Yeah, maybe that'll work if I just keep it in the corner. I don't know. Uh, no, no, no. So... Let's go. Try to find... Right? I was like, I need to find sample data. Yumple, data. Four. Postgres. SQL. Oh. Uh, postgres is one of those words you hear. You get bored. I will say... Okay. It's.... Okay. It's... I've been working on learning it from scratch, meaning that like I didn't do any Googles. I haven't had a guest on my show about it. It is something that... I think it's a little bit more of a... It's a little bit more of a... Installing locally was very difficult
.. Okay. It's... I've been working on learning it from scratch, meaning that like I didn't do any Googles. I haven't had a guest on my show about it. It is something that... I think it's a little bit more of a... It's a little bit more of a... Installing locally was very difficult Installing on Docker was less difficult. And what I'm using right now has probably been the easiest. I also... Like, I... I guess I just don't want it to seem like it's just a promotion of where I work. And in an hour, what I was trying to do the last three weeks. And... It's a bit..
Installing on Docker was less difficult. And what I'm using right now has probably been the easiest. I also... Like, I... I guess I just don't want it to seem like it's just a promotion of where I work. And in an hour, what I was trying to do the last three weeks. And... It's a bit.... It's a bit... I opening when it can be something that easy and it's free. Yet, I would check out my... If you want to see like what I did to set it up in the different versions, I will go look at the YouTube's YouTube. YouTube. This way. Oh, I don't want to verify it's me
.. It's a bit... I opening when it can be something that easy and it's free. Yet, I would check out my... If you want to see like what I did to set it up in the different versions, I will go look at the YouTube's YouTube. YouTube. This way. Oh, I don't want to verify it's me Can you just go to my YouTube, bro? I don't know why today is very... Password authentication heavy. It's not... It's not fun. It is not fun. You did it. You guys can see my stats. It's okay. It is a growing channel. Oh, hey! That was yesterday's stream. It already has 14 views. Into likes
Can you just go to my YouTube, bro? I don't know why today is very... Password authentication heavy. It's not... It's not fun. It is not fun. You did it. You guys can see my stats. It's okay. It is a growing channel. Oh, hey! That was yesterday's stream. It already has 14 views. Into likes Into likes. That is exciting. Play this. I'm setting up postgres. This is it. Share a link. So each week it goes through like what I've done so far. So if you're like... You want to check it out. Totally do. I can also show you... Manus. Here. I'm going to show you... Ooh, here
Into likes. That is exciting. Play this. I'm setting up postgres. This is it. Share a link. So each week it goes through like what I've done so far. So if you're like... You want to check it out. Totally do. I can also show you... Manus. Here. I'm going to show you... Ooh, here.. Ooh, here. Hey, did you? Is week one I tried to set up local and that is why it says no. I would not suggest it to anybody. And then week two I set up Docker. That to me and why I'm... Like leaning towards the place that I am employed is... Setting up Docker I had to learn Docker
.. Ooh, here. Hey, did you? Is week one I tried to set up local and that is why it says no. I would not suggest it to anybody. And then week two I set up Docker. That to me and why I'm... Like leaning towards the place that I am employed is... Setting up Docker I had to learn Docker I have never used Docker before. That's why a buddy of mine actually came on stream. After that one it was like, Jen, you should probably learn a little bit about Docker. I did. It was very helpful. And then week three was securing the connection
I have never used Docker before. That's why a buddy of mine actually came on stream. After that one it was like, Jen, you should probably learn a little bit about Docker. I did. It was very helpful. And then week three was securing the connection And I spent so much time looking up like the SSL for it or the TLS. As was mentioned earlier. And then also managing users and permissions and creating the schemas. It was all just kind of confusing. So and it was still with PG admin yet. It looked a little bit different than this
And I spent so much time looking up like the SSL for it or the TLS. As was mentioned earlier. And then also managing users and permissions and creating the schemas. It was all just kind of confusing. So and it was still with PG admin yet. It looked a little bit different than this But I don't know if that's because of what I installed on Docker. Or because this just had an update. But on. My place of employment. It also just said, yo, dude, you want to like add a user? Go to users. Yeah. You want to, you know, do some security and get started. Let's do it
But I don't know if that's because of what I installed on Docker. Or because this just had an update. But on. My place of employment. It also just said, yo, dude, you want to like add a user? Go to users. Yeah. You want to, you know, do some security and get started. Let's do it Let's do it. Let's secure your connection. And that's kind of why I was like in shock. I was like, wait, this is like telling me how to do stuff very easily. Just give this step. I can even add data from here. We're not going to do that. But we could. I don't know. I'm not to that point yet
Let's do it. Let's secure your connection. And that's kind of why I was like in shock. I was like, wait, this is like telling me how to do stuff very easily. Just give this step. I can even add data from here. We're not going to do that. But we could. I don't know. I'm not to that point yet I haven't found the data. I'm going to upload. And I'm trying it because I need to learn all of this. And it's where I work. I add the developer advocate there. I will be creating how to videos. So. I'm. I'm stoked. Oh, thank you. I'm going to upload. Yo, I don't know what I just clicked
I haven't found the data. I'm going to upload. And I'm trying it because I need to learn all of this. And it's where I work. I add the developer advocate there. I will be creating how to videos. So. I'm. I'm stoked. Oh, thank you. I'm going to upload. Yo, I don't know what I just clicked I just clicked something. And it like took me away. I don't, I don't know. But thank you, Alison. It was going to reply to you. Yeah, apparently I got excited and clicked stuff that it that does. That does tend to happen. Yes. I've been. I've been. I've been. I've been. I've been. I've been
I just clicked something. And it like took me away. I don't, I don't know. But thank you, Alison. It was going to reply to you. Yeah, apparently I got excited and clicked stuff that it that does. That does tend to happen. Yes. I've been. I've been. I've been. I've been. I've been. I've been I've been. I've been. Yes. Ivan has been so dope. They are very supportive about me learning live and knowing that I need to learn a lot like continue learning to be the best developer advocate. I can be. And then also
I've been. I've been. Yes. Ivan has been so dope. They are very supportive about me learning live and knowing that I need to learn a lot like continue learning to be the best developer advocate. I can be. And then also And then also. One of the other reasons I'm learning postgres is so I can put all of my past habit on it, I think, what is it about femalelings a lot and That would help. I wonder if they ever have like the awkward streamer awards because if they did, I still think I would win
And then also. One of the other reasons I'm learning postgres is so I can put all of my past habit on it, I think, what is it about femalelings a lot and That would help. I wonder if they ever have like the awkward streamer awards because if they did, I still think I would win Anyway, hey, there you go. That's my photo. That's about me. And these are the three projects I have. You can now see what I'm looking at, which is exciting. I am working. I feel like we would have to tie from most awkward. We could tie. It is something
Anyway, hey, there you go. That's my photo. That's about me. And these are the three projects I have. You can now see what I'm looking at, which is exciting. I am working. I feel like we would have to tie from most awkward. We could tie. It is something It is something. It's one of the fun things about streaming and doing live streaming is you'll learn to be okay with being awkward. And what I want to do with all three of these, which we'll do here. Myrall board, zoom out. Zoom out is zoom in on the website
It is something. It's one of the fun things about streaming and doing live streaming is you'll learn to be okay with being awkward. And what I want to do with all three of these, which we'll do here. Myrall board, zoom out. Zoom out is zoom in on the website I want to be able to make it easier to stay and be able to put all the podcast stuff here and live stream stuff. And this is process up and going so far. You've been using Postgres the last couple of days with direct us
I want to be able to make it easier to stay and be able to put all the podcast stuff here and live stream stuff. And this is process up and going so far. You've been using Postgres the last couple of days with direct us A CMS built from databases and you're building it for a personal website that you're going to bring up. Cool. If you're open to learning other ones, I mean, this is just me also learning about the company I work for too. Because I'm doing the free tier of Ivan just to do it and compare to you
A CMS built from databases and you're building it for a personal website that you're going to bring up. Cool. If you're open to learning other ones, I mean, this is just me also learning about the company I work for too. Because I'm doing the free tier of Ivan just to do it and compare to you And I haven't used direct us yet. It was super easy to connect and to get over to PG admin. So on that note, I'm like literally just wanting to curious how it compares than anything. Okay. Let me keep locking on me. Wait, this is this is definitely it. Also oh, I need to tag him
And I haven't used direct us yet. It was super easy to connect and to get over to PG admin. So on that note, I'm like literally just wanting to curious how it compares than anything. Okay. Let me keep locking on me. Wait, this is this is definitely it. Also oh, I need to tag him And what are you building on your website, Allison? Okay. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. I will say I just did a stream about hosting because I come from a shared hosting background
And what are you building on your website, Allison? Okay. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. I will say I just did a stream about hosting because I come from a shared hosting background So now going into like learning, then learning JavaScript and then learning like about for sale and netlify and things. I'm like, wait a second. This is all a lot different than shared hosting
So now going into like learning, then learning JavaScript and then learning like about for sale and netlify and things. I'm like, wait a second. This is all a lot different than shared hosting It's a, well, it does have some of that, but it's more of the data infrastructure itself like the managing the databases and being able to so that way you don't have to go through and set it up and manage with like AWS, it does it for you. So you get to have this all in one nice little thing box
It's a, well, it does have some of that, but it's more of the data infrastructure itself like the managing the databases and being able to so that way you don't have to go through and set it up and manage with like AWS, it does it for you. So you get to have this all in one nice little thing box I will say you asked me in a couple months, that might be different and have a deeper better understanding. And what is this human's name? We need to shout out this human because they have really good stream music and I don't remember. I'm jealous. Oh, yay
I will say you asked me in a couple months, that might be different and have a deeper better understanding. And what is this human's name? We need to shout out this human because they have really good stream music and I don't remember. I'm jealous. Oh, yay Oh, yay. I built, I'm building my site with Astro as well. Actually, I have that as part of over here because it's been like people have asked like what I've been building with. So I've been trying to like showcase it and see what I'm doing. So, ah, yeah, yeah. It took a while
Oh, yay. I built, I'm building my site with Astro as well. Actually, I have that as part of over here because it's been like people have asked like what I've been building with. So I've been trying to like showcase it and see what I'm doing. So, ah, yeah, yeah. It took a while It took a while. I got really stuck on things weren't adjusting properly for me for this
It took a while. I got really stuck on things weren't adjusting properly for me for this So when I went into like, mobile, it wasn't looking great, but a lot of it had to do with some of the customizations I did, but then also the, the, the, the person that made the theme because I'm using this brutal theme is going to come on the stream sometime. I'm very excited
So when I went into like, mobile, it wasn't looking great, but a lot of it had to do with some of the customizations I did, but then also the, the, the, the person that made the theme because I'm using this brutal theme is going to come on the stream sometime. I'm very excited I'm very excited. It's going to be great. Oh, they're streaming right now. We're still going to be talking about because they always have really good music. Okay. Let me know how you build out your architecture
I'm very excited. It's going to be great. Oh, they're streaming right now. We're still going to be talking about because they always have really good music. Okay. Let me know how you build out your architecture I'd love to have a conversation about that because since I started learning how to do all of this, it's been a lot more of the front end. I will say after starting at Ivan and I'm so curious about the architecture side. I'm like, dude, did architecture is just like so cool
I'd love to have a conversation about that because since I started learning how to do all of this, it's been a lot more of the front end. I will say after starting at Ivan and I'm so curious about the architecture side. I'm like, dude, did architecture is just like so cool Yet, I, it's harder to see instant, like, you know, gratification like you can with front end, at least in my experience. Let's do this. Let's do this. Okay. So, see him, Gaffine. Here's the best music. Music. Okay. That's not high school music. Yay. So, I would just, yeah. Here's the best music
Yet, I, it's harder to see instant, like, you know, gratification like you can with front end, at least in my experience. Let's do this. Let's do this. Okay. So, see him, Gaffine. Here's the best music. Music. Okay. That's not high school music. Yay. So, I would just, yeah. Here's the best music Music. There we go. I can, I can put things. I can write. I'm thinking about it because I'm like, I don't have any music going. I really want some music. But I don't want to figure out the royalty free stuff at the moment. Focus, Jen. Focus. We can do this. Okay. We need to go back to sample data
Music. There we go. I can, I can put things. I can write. I'm thinking about it because I'm like, I don't have any music going. I really want some music. But I don't want to figure out the royalty free stuff at the moment. Focus, Jen. Focus. We can do this. Okay. We need to go back to sample data Sample data. Yes. Yes. This download the post-c cross sample database. Oh. I'm going through options really quick. Oh, look. Sample databases. Wow. This website is hard to read. Okay. Many database systems provide a sample databases with a product. A good interior to popular. Discussions
Sample data. Yes. Yes. This download the post-c cross sample database. Oh. I'm going through options really quick. Oh, look. Sample databases. Wow. This website is hard to read. Okay. Many database systems provide a sample databases with a product. A good interior to popular. Discussions Discussions. Ball the blah. Nice. Yay. I love meeting new cool dope people. What it's about databases and a database name. Name. Name. Name. Roo. That is going to be your name. I made the database. And databases. That's one. Okay. That's cool. It didn't import anything. Just created the name. Okay

If I want to import, it looks like it was just the get started. Add data. This one does have load sample data. We're going to see what it decides to do
I mean, I guess. But I always go with the default if we, notifications do we have? I got your follow, let's follow you. Yay. OK, focus. If I want to import, it looks like it was just the get started. Add data. This one does have load sample data. We're going to see what it decides to do Oh, database imported. OK. Is there a way to reset you? Pretty fresh. Did it do. Oh, application user. Background worker launcher. Oh, what is. That doesn't look great. What's kids? Oh. PG one icon on the left. I can ah. Refresh. Good call. I don't know why if it's just like because of
Oh, database imported. OK. Is there a way to reset you? Pretty fresh. Did it do. Oh, application user. Background worker launcher. Oh, what is. That doesn't look great. What's kids? Oh. PG one icon on the left. I can ah. Refresh. Good call. I don't know why if it's just like because of It being like you have to right click it that it just doesn't make sense to me. OK, why are the rest of these like not? OK, that one connected. I deleted name or. I don't even exist. I just have default. So we're just going to delete and drop this one. Oh, OK. Oh, name or is back. Whatever did
It being like you have to right click it that it just doesn't make sense to me. OK, why are the rest of these like not? OK, that one connected. I deleted name or. I don't even exist.

That does totally make sense. But hey, we have we have things here. And. Do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Those questions. OK. Well. Queery tool
Whatever did. Let's go look at. Put. Yeah, go. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that does make sense. That does totally make sense. But hey, we have we have things here. And. Do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Those questions. OK. Well. Queery tool Well. Queery tool. That is the next point is to query and. Interesting. I've never actually written a query. In fact, we're mowing and I were talking about this today and I was like, you know what? I'm going to figure that out today. Let's. Yeah. Let's. Let's. Let's. Let's. Let's learn the query
Well. Queery tool. That is the next point is to query and. Interesting. I've never actually written a query. In fact, we're mowing and I were talking about this today and I was like, you know what? I'm going to figure that out today. Let's. Yeah. Let's. Let's. Let's. Let's. Let's learn the query Oh, yeah. That's actually a big thing that Ramon was talking about. If you, if nobody, if nobody, if you all haven't followed Ramon yet, you should. Let's see if I can do a shout out. Shout out. Shout out. And then. At Ramon. Oh, that's the milk. That's the milk. Yeah. Y'all should follow
Oh, yeah. That's actually a big thing that Ramon was talking about. If you, if nobody, if nobody, if you all haven't followed Ramon yet, you should. Let's see if I can do a shout out. Shout out. Shout out. And then. At Ramon. Oh, that's the milk. That's the milk. Yeah. Y'all should follow Oh, that's the milk. He also streams a lot of content and is one of the main people reasons that I do stream. And also it is. I think it's a lot to do with. Learning. Exit, exit, exit, exit, exit all the things. Okay. Oh, okay. Standard. So learning the SQL query language can expand
Oh, that's the milk. He also streams a lot of content and is one of the main people reasons that I do stream. And also it is. I think it's a lot to do with. Learning. Exit, exit, exit, exit, exit all the things. Okay. Oh, okay. Standard. So learning the SQL query language can expand You know others as well. Kind of like each language has its for loop. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And rivet your big fan of the W3 schools SQL tutorial reference. Oh, interesting. I'm curious. Do you guys say SQL or SQL? Because like, I think I use both without realizing it. Yeah, it's going to look at this
You know others as well. Kind of like each language has its for loop. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And rivet your big fan of the W3 schools SQL tutorial reference. Oh, interesting. I'm curious. Do you guys say SQL or SQL? Because like, I think I use both without realizing it. Yeah, it's going to look at this Interesting. I honestly feel like I say both, but I don't I don't know why it's kind of weird. Look, exercise, insert the missing statement from the columns. Yeah. This is cool. I say Jason as well instead of Jason. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that. Hello, hello, did you. Wow. Words
Interesting. I honestly feel like I say both, but I don't I don't know why it's kind of weird. Look, exercise, insert the missing statement from the columns. Yeah. This is cool. I say Jason as well instead of Jason. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that. Hello, hello, did you. Wow. Words Wow. Words. Did you. How can I not say I'm sorry I'm messing up your name completely right now. But welcome. Welcome. We are learning about postgres. Well, I'm learning about postgres. They kind of know more about postgres than I do at the moment. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that
Wow. Words. Did you. How can I not say I'm sorry I'm messing up your name completely right now. But welcome. Welcome. We are learning about postgres. Well, I'm learning about postgres. They kind of know more about postgres than I do at the moment. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that. I will get there. Wonder. Top. SQL. Crearies. Up to you know queries. Most important SQL queries in 2022. What. How do I do that? I don't know how. Did I click this? Whoa
I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that. I will get there. Wonder. Top. SQL. Crearies. Up to you know queries. Most important SQL queries in 2022. What. How do I do that? I don't know how. Did I click this? Whoa Well, apparently I'm learning stuff about Google as well because I never knew that you could click this. This is cool. Do I have a job? Yes. Yes, I do have a job. I work at Ivan, which is a data infrastructure company. And I have a lot of tools for what I do
Well, apparently I'm learning stuff about Google as well because I never knew that you could click this. This is cool. Do I have a job? Yes. Yes, I do have a job. I work at Ivan, which is a data infrastructure company. And I have a lot of tools for what I do I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do. Retrieving tables. Oh, cool. I think that's also going to be a part of it of like, do. Like what commands are out there. Yeah! It's better now. So, it's like Query. Oh, that's cool. Thank you, both of you. Select from table name and see what I get
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do. Retrieving tables. Oh, cool. I think that's also going to be a part of it of like, do. Like what commands are out there. Yeah! It's better now. So, it's like Query. Oh, that's cool. Thank you, both of you. Select from table name and see what I get Okay, yeah. This is fun. Yes, I will say this is so weird though, like having to stumble through it a bit more instead of being able to like have a guest on teaching me through it, but it is really fun of being able to, you know, learn it in a bit of a slower basis
Okay, yeah. This is fun. Yes, I will say this is so weird though, like having to stumble through it a bit more instead of being able to like have a guest on teaching me through it, but it is really fun of being able to, you know, learn it in a bit of a slower basis This is actually something I know I'm oddly pausing of... Oh, there we go. I don't know what tables I had. It was like, I know my schema. I don't know what tables I have, but we have... I don't know what, what, is there an undo? No, okay, we'll just get to fit back in there. That was a little..
This is actually something I know I'm oddly pausing of... Oh, there we go. I don't know what tables I had. It was like, I know my schema. I don't know what tables I have, but we have... I don't know what, what, is there an undo? No, okay, we'll just get to fit back in there. That was a little.... Can you go back in there? Go back. Okay, there we go. Yes, yes. I will say being able to go through something that I have found is..
.. Can you go back in there? Go back. Okay, there we go. Yes, yes. I will say being able to go through something that I have found is.... I don't know if it's something about just the way people have learned or like time frames that they learned, like when they went to school or where they went to school. Rhythm? Yes. Yes, let's do it. That's awesome
.. I don't know if it's something about just the way people have learned or like time frames that they learned, like when they went to school or where they went to school. Rhythm? Yes. Yes, let's do it. That's awesome That's awesome. It's definitely something like I purposely wanted to stumble through this with Postgres to learn it
That's awesome. It's definitely something like I purposely wanted to stumble through this with Postgres to learn it So that way I really understood some of these spots that are harder to learn with by the time I got to Ivan, because when I was interviewing with Ivan, I did set up a trial before they had the free tier. And I went and I set it up with Prisma. We had somebody on the show from Prisma
So that way I really understood some of these spots that are harder to learn with by the time I got to Ivan, because when I was interviewing with Ivan, I did set up a trial before they had the free tier. And I went and I set it up with Prisma. We had somebody on the show from Prisma And it was really cool. Yet I was like, I don't know what we just did. Like I get it, but I don't get it. And I think I also didn't understand how difficult it was. Not realizing that's without that knowledge
And it was really cool. Yet I was like, I don't know what we just did. Like I get it, but I don't get it. And I think I also didn't understand how difficult it was. Not realizing that's without that knowledge Because it was so easy when I used Ivan before I started going down and looking at databases. Yet data infrastructure is so fascinating. Prisma screen. Okay, there we go. Anybody wants to look at that? That would be dope. And while you're there, you know, feel free to give me a follow
Because it was so easy when I used Ivan before I started going down and looking at databases. Yet data infrastructure is so fascinating. Prisma screen. Okay, there we go. Anybody wants to look at that? That would be dope. And while you're there, you know, feel free to give me a follow Because or subscribe. YouTube is subscribe. Because you can't actually like do a ton with YouTube until you had a so you have a thousand subs. It's crazy. Rivet used to joke that the easiest way to get two devs to fight is to have them design a database schema together. Interesting
Because or subscribe. YouTube is subscribe. Because you can't actually like do a ton with YouTube until you had a so you have a thousand subs. It's crazy. Rivet used to joke that the easiest way to get two devs to fight is to have them design a database schema together. Interesting Interesting. And I think that's also one of the parts here. Let me go back to the iPad is. Over there is last week. I guess two weeks ago now when I was looking into. Secure your connection that or we already talked about that. That's our making a lot more sense. Manage your users and permissions
Interesting. And I think that's also one of the parts here. Let me go back to the iPad is. Over there is last week. I guess two weeks ago now when I was looking into. Secure your connection that or we already talked about that. That's our making a lot more sense. Manage your users and permissions Cool. That made a lot of sense. I was like, I'm not going to create schemas and tables. And I was like, so what's the difference? That is something that I still need to look into and. Do you. I don't know. I don't think it'll work until. We'll have time till after I'm. Get back
Cool. That made a lot of sense. I was like, I'm not going to create schemas and tables. And I was like, so what's the difference? That is something that I still need to look into and. Do you. I don't know. I don't think it'll work until. We'll have time till after I'm. Get back Get back. The next two weeks I'm going to be gone. It's going to be crazy. But I will pin that to my. I will be going to be gone. I will be gone. I will be gone. To somewhere saying that gems out of town. Because I think actually. Actually. What up. How would I say your name? Oskrptor
Get back. The next two weeks I'm going to be gone. It's going to be crazy. But I will pin that to my. I will be going to be gone. I will be gone. I will be gone. To somewhere saying that gems out of town. Because I think actually. Actually. What up. How would I say your name? Oskrptor Are you an Australian. Cryptocurrency person. That is what I got from your name. I got a lot of things from my. I got a lot of things from my. And what's in them. Okay. That being said, something that was really great feedback that I got. On Twitter, which is so fun when you get feedback
Are you an Australian. Cryptocurrency person. That is what I got from your name. I got a lot of things from my. I got a lot of things from my. And what's in them. Okay. That being said, something that was really great feedback that I got. On Twitter, which is so fun when you get feedback They're like, yeah, you got to talk about this is. To do. Other crypt rubber in Austin, Texas. That is also a way that that could. I could see that. Yeah. But that I feel like a crypt. Robert would be more in like. Louisiana. Yes, yes, we do. Come join us on streams
They're like, yeah, you got to talk about this is. To do. Other crypt rubber in Austin, Texas. That is also a way that that could. I could see that. Yeah. But that I feel like a crypt. Robert would be more in like. Louisiana. Yes, yes, we do. Come join us on streams And then we will give you a new backstory. It will be fun. So let me. I know. Mira. Mira scrolling way too fast. When I was talking about on my website that. I wanted these to be to. Like teach gentech to have its own pages
And then we will give you a new backstory. It will be fun. So let me. I know. Mira. Mira scrolling way too fast. When I was talking about on my website that. I wanted these to be to. Like teach gentech to have its own pages That would have the YouTube and bed video description, guest context associated links and then the transcripts. Where like the podcast side is going to be a bit more complicated. I mean, it's interesting because
That would have the YouTube and bed video description, guest context associated links and then the transcripts. Where like the podcast side is going to be a bit more complicated. I mean, it's interesting because The podcast links, the podcast links, the podcast link, episode description, guest context, associate links and then the stream. So does that mean I would have two different skimas instead of two different tables, because they have different content? Oh, okay
The podcast links, the podcast links, the podcast link, episode description, guest context, associate links and then the stream. So does that mean I would have two different skimas instead of two different tables, because they have different content? Oh, okay about our back stories for you as an Australian security stuff, cyber security, as a instead of being a crypt robber from Austin, Texas, I still like that one though
about our back stories for you as an Australian security stuff, cyber security, as a instead of being a crypt robber from Austin, Texas, I still like that one though I'm wondering, can we, you could say that you are a crypt robber and you're stealing API keys? Just saying, like I'm trying to figure some security stuff, stealing API keys from crypts, but security kind of
I'm wondering, can we, you could say that you are a crypt robber and you're stealing API keys? Just saying, like I'm trying to figure some security stuff, stealing API keys from crypts, but security kind of Would probably be a schema with multiple tables, but there are other DBAs that we'll fight on that. You've been coding for over 20 years as a freelance developer. Nice, nice. Yes, database administrator
Would probably be a schema with multiple tables, but there are other DBAs that we'll fight on that. You've been coding for over 20 years as a freelance developer. Nice, nice. Yes, database administrator I did get that one, but I think a database administrator, I always think of like, at some point I should ask people this, what is the difference between a database administrator and a sysadmin systems admin
I did get that one, but I think a database administrator, I always think of like, at some point I should ask people this, what is the difference between a database administrator and a sysadmin systems admin I don't actually know if there is a thing, like what a system admin person does, but a Oscar that is what type of development have you been doing? Was, and is there something that originally got you into it
I don't actually know if there is a thing, like what a system admin person does, but a Oscar that is what type of development have you been doing? Was, and is there something that originally got you into it Or, oh, as like a total side note, y'all, Ben Gamble, who has been on the show a few times about the basics of data
Or, oh, as like a total side note, y'all, Ben Gamble, who has been on the show a few times about the basics of data Like, y'all, we are talking about like going from the cash to the CPU to, you know, to an SSR, all hardware stuff, and this is exciting. He's going to give me a Raspberry Pi to set up, and I'm going to see what I can do. And I'm going to stream it. I am excited, not excited. Okay
Like, y'all, we are talking about like going from the cash to the CPU to, you know, to an SSR, all hardware stuff, and this is exciting. He's going to give me a Raspberry Pi to set up, and I'm going to see what I can do. And I'm going to stream it. I am excited, not excited. Okay Okay. Okay, this makes sense, and thank you
Okay. Okay, this makes sense, and thank you What about like, I love getting into databases because this is like, I don't know why I find it so fascinating, but also feel very, very silly of like, what do you manage on a database that is so large
What about like, I love getting into databases because this is like, I don't know why I find it so fascinating, but also feel very, very silly of like, what do you manage on a database that is so large Is it doing these queries and if a query breaks or, oh, I like, oh, Alison, that is a great callout
Is it doing these queries and if a query breaks or, oh, I like, oh, Alison, that is a great callout Thank you. That was good to know. And, uh, Oscar, I dig it. Okay. Okay. Interesting. Interesting. So many things to learn. And I will say, uh, right. Like that means sense. Like what you just said, Alison, it makes sense to me. Like, hey, this is what goes into a database
Thank you. That was good to know. And, uh, Oscar, I dig it. Okay. Okay. Interesting. Interesting. So many things to learn. And I will say, uh, right. Like that means sense. Like what you just said, Alison, it makes sense to me. Like, hey, this is what goes into a database It's when we're going from, let's say, like actually going into learn the queries and why you would query them. I think is one of the harder things for me to conceptualize
It's when we're going from, let's say, like actually going into learn the queries and why you would query them. I think is one of the harder things for me to conceptualize And then how in, how am I going to set that up to show up properly in my website? Because in the previous website, I made, I had multiple JSON files and there wasn't like one source of truth. So that's why I'm like, huh. Well, interesting. Oh, that's cool. Rivet. Interesting. Yes. This might help
And then how in, how am I going to set that up to show up properly in my website? Because in the previous website, I made, I had multiple JSON files and there wasn't like one source of truth. So that's why I'm like, huh. Well, interesting. Oh, that's cool. Rivet. Interesting. Yes. This might help This might help. Let's go find my GitHub. Let's go find GitHub. GitHub. It's this website. But look, this is my old master website load load. Please load. Hey, loaded. So this is when I was looking for a job. I got a job so I don't need it to say hire me anymore. And I didn't like that
This might help. Let's go find my GitHub. Let's go find GitHub. GitHub. It's this website. But look, this is my old master website load load. Please load. Hey, loaded. So this is when I was looking for a job. I got a job so I don't need it to say hire me anymore. And I didn't like that It was only one website. So, but if I go to my perf. Okay. If I go into the stream schedule, it was where I had like a JSON file for all of these. And then I would have a different JSON file for each of these components for code, writing and speaking
It was only one website. So, but if I go to my perf. Okay. If I go into the stream schedule, it was where I had like a JSON file for all of these. And then I would have a different JSON file for each of these components for code, writing and speaking DB admin 10 to monitor databases, creating users. Ah, okay. Okay. That is good to know. Um. Let me. I don't think I have an on my computer. I'm maybe in sublime. I don't have hyper open anyway. I don't want to go log into all that we'll just do this. Do you do you do you do you
DB admin 10 to monitor databases, creating users. Ah, okay. Okay. That is good to know. Um. Let me. I don't think I have an on my computer. I'm maybe in sublime. I don't have hyper open anyway. I don't want to go log into all that we'll just do this. Do you do you do you do you Ah, I think it's the other one site. I think I can go to leave that one. That's fine. I would leave this one. Live stress. Okay. Uh. So, uh, I think it's interesting
Ah, I think it's the other one site. I think I can go to leave that one. That's fine. I would leave this one. Live stress. Okay. Uh. So, uh, I think it's interesting No, this is a you both are everyone is bringing up really great points in a this is a big reason I do stream them is because it's helpful to learn
No, this is a you both are everyone is bringing up really great points in a this is a big reason I do stream them is because it's helpful to learn If some point down the road somebody is asking me these questions, what will make it easier for others to learn about it? Where did I get stuff? What is something that I can maybe help somebody else get through? So. Uh, I'm bringing this up because this is like conceptually
If some point down the road somebody is asking me these questions, what will make it easier for others to learn about it? Where did I get stuff? What is something that I can maybe help somebody else get through? So. Uh, I'm bringing this up because this is like conceptually I'm struggling with where I'm struggling of this is the astro website my first astro website that I built. And under data. I actually had to make they each had a JSON file that had an index file. That's why I was like so
I'm struggling with where I'm struggling of this is the astro website my first astro website that I built. And under data. I actually had to make they each had a JSON file that had an index file. That's why I was like so If I had a database, I could tell this component to just load those things from the database instead of having to. I think that's where I'm stuck is like, okay, cool. I can query the database. Then how do I attach it to the front end? That is where I'm stuck
If I had a database, I could tell this component to just load those things from the database instead of having to. I think that's where I'm stuck is like, okay, cool. I can query the database. Then how do I attach it to the front end? That is where I'm stuck Yes, and I believe that is what I'll be using. I can close this to you now. Yay. Prisma for I don't know if y'all have used or heard of prisma. Yeah, go. So. Yes, yes. So I've done something in prisma and it was really easy to take a look at their content
Yes, and I believe that is what I'll be using. I can close this to you now. Yay. Prisma for I don't know if y'all have used or heard of prisma. Yeah, go. So. Yes, yes. So I've done something in prisma and it was really easy to take a look at their content And this is and I think Allison, this is going to take a place of direct us because prisma will connect the front to the back with the day race that I created with Ivan. I also, it sounds. I don't know if this makes sense, but like I want to test out Ivan as well. Yes, I'm learning it cool
And this is and I think Allison, this is going to take a place of direct us because prisma will connect the front to the back with the day race that I created with Ivan. I also, it sounds. I don't know if this makes sense, but like I want to test out Ivan as well. Yes, I'm learning it cool I work for them. Yes, all of that. I want to have my site set up on that. So if I have errors that I can either work on getting them fixed or be like, no, grow, like this is going to be a better option for you instead. It's. I like it so far, but I also have an. Stress tested it
I work for them. Yes, all of that. I want to have my site set up on that. So if I have errors that I can either work on getting them fixed or be like, no, grow, like this is going to be a better option for you instead. It's. I like it so far, but I also have an. Stress tested it Stress tested it. I guess you could say the word I'm looking for. I want to stress test what. I wear I work. Yeah, but I will be using this eventually, eventually. Okay, we can close this now. That was exciting. Okay, so that connected the database. That was fun. Go back, go back, go back
Stress tested it. I guess you could say the word I'm looking for. I want to stress test what. I wear I work. Yeah, but I will be using this eventually, eventually. Okay, we can close this now. That was exciting. Okay, so that connected the database. That was fun. Go back, go back, go back I'm anyway. Query did. And what was after my that step. Oh, my goodness. It keeps logging. Query data data types. Hmm. I even know what that means. Well, like I know what data types are. Oh, that's cool. I think they did. Did. Oh. That's cool. I think they did. I think they did
I'm anyway. Query did. And what was after my that step. Oh, my goodness. It keeps logging. Query data data types. Hmm. I even know what that means. Well, like I know what data types are. Oh, that's cool. I think they did. Did. Oh. That's cool. I think they did. I think they did I think they did. Well, let's pace this file. Copy file. You have to copy it before you paste it. Okay. Oh, wait, wait. Paste data. Oh, whoa. That is really helpful. Allison, thank you. And see if you can find a table that's likely to have numbers and or dates. Okay. Interesting. Oh. So
I think they did. Well, let's pace this file. Copy file. You have to copy it before you paste it. Okay. Oh, wait, wait. Paste data. Oh, whoa. That is really helpful. Allison, thank you. And see if you can find a table that's likely to have numbers and or dates. Okay. Interesting. Oh. So Oh. So. Would that mean that this top part would be part of the schema? Because it's telling me what part of how I would want my table set up. Or this would just be part of the table. I mean, I know it says my table, create table, but I'll look into that. Let me first look at
Oh. So. Would that mean that this top part would be part of the schema? Because it's telling me what part of how I would want my table set up. Or this would just be part of the table. I mean, I know it says my table, create table, but I'll look into that. Let me first look at Find a table with these things. Okay. As. Going to. I'm going to use this in here. Going there. Thank you. Let's tweet about it. Pretty dope to use. Well, figuring out. And I'm gonna have to do this on. Believe it. To. To. We can give you the. Thanks
Find a table with these things. Okay. As. Going to. I'm going to use this in here. Going there. Thank you. Let's tweet about it. Pretty dope to use. Well, figuring out. And I'm gonna have to do this on. Believe it. To. To. We can give you the. Thanks Thanks. Allison, I don't know actually know what your name is on there. Oh, my God. Something just got in my eye. I just saw. Bam. Bam. Tweet it. It happened. Okay. Goodness. That command that creates part of the schema defines the schema creates the table. And. I'm gonna say yes. Okay. And
Thanks. Allison, I don't know actually know what your name is on there. Oh, my God. Something just got in my eye. I just saw. Bam. Bam. Tweet it. It happened. Okay. Goodness. That command that creates part of the schema defines the schema creates the table. And. I'm gonna say yes. Okay. And Okay. And. Oh, my goodness. I've all please function. It has cool p on it. Properties. Okay. I don't know. I have to query it. See it all. And I don't know. Oh, wait. Okay. Girls triggers. Sniffles. I don't know. I don't know. And I look forward to seeing you back and connecting. Okay
Okay. And. Oh, my goodness. I've all please function. It has cool p on it. Properties. Okay. I don't know. I have to query it. See it all. And I don't know. Oh, wait. Okay. Girls triggers. Sniffles. I don't know. I don't know. And I look forward to seeing you back and connecting. Okay Okay. Is there a way. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what each of them. Do. Don't say this. That's fine. We don't need to say that query. There's constraints. You know, constraints. Interesting. Okay. Let's see. Oh, there's types of something. You. Okay. Query tool. Oh, yay
Okay. Is there a way. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what each of them. Do. Don't say this. That's fine. We don't need to say that query. There's constraints. You know, constraints. Interesting. Okay. Let's see. Oh, there's types of something. You. Okay. Query tool. Oh, yay Oh, yay. Although I feel like your name makes people sad. People get sad that there's no free Wi-Fi for them. And that one. Okay. Okay. Okay. How to read. The select statement information schema. Are used. Column types. And that's what I'm going to do. Interesting
Oh, yay. Although I feel like your name makes people sad. People get sad that there's no free Wi-Fi for them. And that one. Okay. Okay. Okay. How to read. The select statement information schema. Are used. Column types. And that's what I'm going to do. Interesting Interesting. Now do a select from one of those tables that in that text field. Yeah. Would it just be like data type? To tell me the data types it has. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That's my doubt. I'm not going to. Start with my select. Done. Done. Okay. Okay
Interesting. Now do a select from one of those tables that in that text field. Yeah. Would it just be like data type? To tell me the data types it has. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That's my doubt. I'm not going to. Start with my select. Done. Done. Okay. Okay Done. Okay. Okay. So when doing it this way, it shows that the data types are like. Integer text text timestamps. Are these the data types? Oh. Okay. Okay. Integer text text text. Small and small and text text timestamp. Oh. See that pk. Okay. Not at the moment. I am very
Done. Okay. Okay. So when doing it this way, it shows that the data types are like. Integer text text timestamps. Are these the data types? Oh. Okay. Okay. Integer text text text. Small and small and text text timestamp. Oh. See that pk. Okay. Not at the moment. I am very I am very. There is a lot going on on the screen. Oh, yes. Pk. Yes. I know. Oh, you can add stuff from here. That's cool. Save results. There's a graph visualizer. Okay. Okay. So it's like what it associates with because if I remember right post grass is. It goes by the column
I am very. There is a lot going on on the screen. Oh, yes. Pk. Yes. I know. Oh, you can add stuff from here. That's cool. Save results. There's a graph visualizer. Okay. Okay. So it's like what it associates with because if I remember right post grass is. It goes by the column So is it saying whatever the primary key is is what it will do. It's a. It's main. ID. So I think that'll. Yay. Okay. Cool. Yay. That's great. I actually yesterday, which rev it. You should definitely. I know my stream schedule has been shit. I'm sorry. And thank you for the call out
So is it saying whatever the primary key is is what it will do. It's a. It's main. ID. So I think that'll. Yay. Okay. Cool. Yay. That's great. I actually yesterday, which rev it. You should definitely. I know my stream schedule has been shit. I'm sorry. And thank you for the call out It is such a good call out. I can't believe I've seen it. But the last time I actually talked about the IDs. Based on the here. I'll actually show you. Because it helped me click with this. So let's go out. We're going to go here. APIs. Oh, my God. It's very zoomed in
It is such a good call out. I can't believe I've seen it. But the last time I actually talked about the IDs. Based on the here. I'll actually show you. Because it helped me click with this. So let's go out. We're going to go here. APIs. Oh, my God. It's very zoomed in But we were talking about how the resource. of like on this one is just a show, I don't my name just because a lot of my knowledge comes from shared hosting
But we were talking about how the resource. of like on this one is just a show, I don't my name just because a lot of my knowledge comes from shared hosting So it was a way of associating it is that is like the ID, but then as we're going into like looking into HTTP version version two is you can we talked a lot about like with the IDs of post put and patch and yes y'all I definitely said lipstick is like a patch changing lipstick is a patch changing your entire outfit but still calling it the same outfit is a put and creating the outfit is a post and that is how I figured out but that reminds me of the databases because you with a put and the patch you can't change your ID
So it was a way of associating it is that is like the ID, but then as we're going into like looking into HTTP version version two is you can we talked a lot about like with the IDs of post put and patch and yes y'all I definitely said lipstick is like a patch changing lipstick is a patch changing your entire outfit but still calling it the same outfit is a put and creating the outfit is a post and that is how I figured out but that reminds me of the databases because you with a put and the patch you can't change your ID I don't know I don't know if that actually goes associates but in my head it did. There are others that will say fk that mark how things relate to another foreign key. Okay let's see if any of these have foreign keys. I don't know if they will. No time stamp is it. Interesting. Maybe payment
I don't know I don't know if that actually goes associates but in my head it did. There are others that will say fk that mark how things relate to another foreign key. Okay let's see if any of these have foreign keys. I don't know if they will. No time stamp is it. Interesting. Maybe payment Maybe payment. Usually when you see a table that is named of two tables next to each other. Oh! Oh that's cool. Okay. Run. Okay it's GratzPot. I don't want to hear. Thank you. Let's do film category. I can type. I can type. We got this gen. Type. That's a good. Interesting
Maybe payment. Usually when you see a table that is named of two tables next to each other. Oh! Oh that's cool. Okay. Run. Okay it's GratzPot. I don't want to hear. Thank you. Let's do film category. I can type. I can type. We got this gen. Type. That's a good. Interesting Interesting. It's like pulling the information but not like combining them because it is saying the category ID and the film ID. Oh okay. Okay. Well that's fun. I feel like this did. Nessus did definitely answer the questions I had to be able to get started today or finish up today's
Interesting. It's like pulling the information but not like combining them because it is saying the category ID and the film ID. Oh okay. Okay. Well that's fun. I feel like this did. Nessus did definitely answer the questions I had to be able to get started today or finish up today's Oh and monitor pg met tricks and logs. That one was actually pretty easy. Let's go up here. I'm going to dashboards and I feel like we're monitoring them. Although we can also skip this finish because we can go to the logs here which learning Postgres shows me the user, the database
Oh and monitor pg met tricks and logs. That one was actually pretty easy. Let's go up here. I'm going to dashboards and I feel like we're monitoring them. Although we can also skip this finish because we can go to the logs here which learning Postgres shows me the user, the database It was disconnected, reconnected. Does it show that I actually like what I looked up? I'm not going to go into like a ton of detail trying to figure out the logs but at least now where to look at it in here and then the metrics which just look like very pretty graphs at the moment
It was disconnected, reconnected. Does it show that I actually like what I looked up? I'm not going to go into like a ton of detail trying to figure out the logs but at least now where to look at it in here and then the metrics which just look like very pretty graphs at the moment These are all things that I can go into later on and dive into because this is one thing that I have learned to love about tech is there is always something new to learn. Oh God. Data normalization. Database normalization. I'm going to just Google what it is. Data based normalization
These are all things that I can go into later on and dive into because this is one thing that I have learned to love about tech is there is always something new to learn. Oh God. Data normalization. Database normalization. I'm going to just Google what it is. Data based normalization Workingizing data in the database. So is this like taking an already existing database that's like a hot mess and it's like, hey, here's the mess. Go fix it. Is that what data based normalization is? 16 other people's messes. That's what it sounds like. Yeah. Okay
Workingizing data in the database. So is this like taking an already existing database that's like a hot mess and it's like, hey, here's the mess. Go fix it. Is that what data based normalization is? 16 other people's messes. That's what it sounds like. Yeah. Okay Yeah. Okay. Ideally you want to do it when you design the database up front but sometimes you have to do it affect. Okay. I would think that I would be creating my own database for like the show and stuff. So I guess I will learn how to create schemas. Yeah. That doesn't sound great
Yeah. Okay. Ideally you want to do it when you design the database up front but sometimes you have to do it affect. Okay. I would think that I would be creating my own database for like the show and stuff. So I guess I will learn how to create schemas. Yeah. That doesn't sound great That sounds very scary. Yet you know a year ago I never thought I would be excited about databases. Restructure that hables to optimize the queries and possibly reduce data duplication. Oh, that is a yes, Rivet. At the moment it has become a very informal process of ways to sign up. Yet hit me up
That sounds very scary. Yet you know a year ago I never thought I would be excited about databases. Restructure that hables to optimize the queries and possibly reduce data duplication. Oh, that is a yes, Rivet. At the moment it has become a very informal process of ways to sign up. Yet hit me up Yet hit me up. So I will. I'm done sharing my screen because we are done for now. I am checked out. I say that as you know I've realized that about two hours is my like brain limit. I'm like I've learned a lot in the last two hours
Yet hit me up. So I will. I'm done sharing my screen because we are done for now. I am checked out. I say that as you know I've realized that about two hours is my like brain limit. I'm like I've learned a lot in the last two hours Yet I am feeling I am feeling optimistic because it's something that is making a lot more sense. Chris, Rivet, if I don't get back to you by tomorrow, feel free to bug me for like the second week of May. I say that because as I was saying on LinkedIn is I am working on creating a better workflow
Yet I am feeling I am feeling optimistic because it's something that is making a lot more sense. Chris, Rivet, if I don't get back to you by tomorrow, feel free to bug me for like the second week of May. I say that because as I was saying on LinkedIn is I am working on creating a better workflow I can't show you guys this really quick because we were doing looking at it. Share the screen. So yes, this is my lovely website goals and the tech I'm doing to learn all of it. But before that, there is this giant giant thing of how I was setting up stuff for the podcast
I can't show you guys this really quick because we were doing looking at it. Share the screen. So yes, this is my lovely website goals and the tech I'm doing to learn all of it. But before that, there is this giant giant thing of how I was setting up stuff for the podcast And I want to do it for teach Gen Tech as well. I see them. You know, have a submission form that will auto-schedule this stuff. So that way I'm like, okay, cool. I don't need to worry about all of this. And I just started using HubSpot again for the first time
And I want to do it for teach Gen Tech as well. I see them. You know, have a submission form that will auto-schedule this stuff. So that way I'm like, okay, cool. I don't need to worry about all of this. And I just started using HubSpot again for the first time So my hope is that I can set this up. That I can be like, hey, Chris, give me this information and see if this works. And if it doesn't, well, we'll just choose date anyway. And thank you for the follow-os crypto
So my hope is that I can set this up. That I can be like, hey, Chris, give me this information and see if this works. And if it doesn't, well, we'll just choose date anyway. And thank you for the follow-os crypto I feel like I will forever remember your name because the backstory that was created for you of Australian cryptocurrency or you know, Austin, Crip, Breaker, when in reality cybersecurity from Australia. That all makes sense. And yes, so automations. We're going to figure it out
I feel like I will forever remember your name because the backstory that was created for you of Australian cryptocurrency or you know, Austin, Crip, Breaker, when in reality cybersecurity from Australia. That all makes sense. And yes, so automations. We're going to figure it out I will say, we are getting there though because can we just log in? Go to my account, bro. You're welcome
I will say, we are getting there though because can we just log in? Go to my account, bro. You're welcome You're welcome. I was able to like, the progress is getting there on all this behind the scene stuff because on like yesterday's stream, I was able to upload my notes from yesterday that I referenced to earlier
You're welcome. I was able to like, the progress is getting there on all this behind the scene stuff because on like yesterday's stream, I was able to upload my notes from yesterday that I referenced to earlier And I uploaded this on HubSpot so it could be its own graphic that people can look at and like you can zoom in and scroll around
And I uploaded this on HubSpot so it could be its own graphic that people can look at and like you can zoom in and scroll around Long long term, like long long term, is to get something to read my handwriting and just auto transcribe it for people that can be get screened, be able to be done by a screen reader because right now I can't. But they do have the video. And so there are things and it also has social media
Long long term, like long long term, is to get something to read my handwriting and just auto transcribe it for people that can be get screened, be able to be done by a screen reader because right now I can't. But they do have the video. And so there are things and it also has social media Look, I did the social medias. I was very excited about that. So yes, next is let's conversations, context. Say it, nice forms to get automations. Oh, lead capture forms. Not really a lead capture but you know what? If that's what works, I'm going to create a form. Stand a little beige. Next, next
Look, I did the social medias. I was very excited about that. So yes, next is let's conversations, context. Say it, nice forms to get automations. Oh, lead capture forms. Not really a lead capture but you know what? If that's what works, I'm going to create a form. Stand a little beige. Next, next Next, next. Build my own template. Okay, well, it doesn't look complicated setup. So I feel like I should know. I actually don't have a discord but if you want to come hang out on the discord, I hang out at it is somewhere. Let's go look at Twitter because I don't remember what is called
Next, next. Build my own template. Okay, well, it doesn't look complicated setup. So I feel like I should know. I actually don't have a discord but if you want to come hang out on the discord, I hang out at it is somewhere. Let's go look at Twitter because I don't remember what is called Okay, search. Open, search, raid guild. This is where I hang out and yay. Okay. Yay. Okay. So here. Do you need to do you know what? I do not disagree with you
Okay, search. Open, search, raid guild. This is where I hang out and yay. Okay. Yay. Okay. So here. Do you need to do you know what? I do not disagree with you HubSpot isn't amazing but it is something and it is better than what I was doing because why do I keep closing my mirror board? Mirror, mirror, mirror, recently closed. Oh my gosh, sniffles today is I was using multiple tools for all of this like I was using my day
HubSpot isn't amazing but it is something and it is better than what I was doing because why do I keep closing my mirror board? Mirror, mirror, mirror, recently closed. Oh my gosh, sniffles today is I was using multiple tools for all of this like I was using my daycom for automation and then I was using notion because it was way cheaper but then it was an automation and then I had to do scheduling through calendar and then recording stuff and then producing stuff and then marketing stuff. This shit gets really expensive
com for automation and then I was using notion because it was way cheaper but then it was an automation and then I had to do scheduling through calendar and then recording stuff and then producing stuff and then marketing stuff.
