From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we can do our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that brings a little bit of chaos into whatever your day may be. This episode is brought to you by Memberful and HelloFresh. I'm Kathy, and with me today is my favorite Conduit co-host, who is also as exhausted as I sound, Jay Miller. We only bring the chaos every 54 episodes annually. Yeah, that is a reference to our topic, but we're not there yet. Let's check out in the Discord the last two weeks where beautiful chaos. We learned that there is an official Ikea mascot in Japan. That is the BLAHA in a suit. There is a Scrub Daddy IPA, if you feel like. What? Yep. Johnny Cube spread throughout the Discord like a virus, including making an appearance on Apple Watch bands and a story time that involved mailing a letter with the Johnny Cube sticker to Tim Cook. Also the quote unquote new Relay FM logo, Relay FM switch on logo was released as a joke, purely a joke in response to the X logo, which is apparently what Twitter is now being called, but you're still tweet and all of the stuff is on Twitter. Listen, we don't need to question anything there. But when we say chaos, check out the chaos in the Discord. I mean, technically, if the X logo is 10, could the Relay R be three? I don't know. I'm trying to see what the closest character to our fancy cool new logo. Also, I heard you say Scrub Daddy IPA, which is definitely just bonkers, but in my head, I thought Scrub Daddy IPO. So I'm closing my bank account. Let's talk about what happened in the coworking session. Things have been going great. We were kind of having a chill day for our coworking session. Then Jay came in with the chaos because that's what he does. And then I proceeded to just obliterate things and ask all the questions of Kathy. Since Kathy was super busy, it's all coming back to me now. Kathy was super busy and needed a distraction. And the team of Jay and coworking companions were able to keep Kathy adequately distracted so that she could do her work. If you want to become a member of the Relay FM, switch on Superconductor power on Amazing Family. Give us the money. I'm a superconductor.com. I don't know what's wrong with Jay, but we're just going to continue on. Javier, please keep this in. I have nothing for you. I'm sorry. So instead, we're going to move on to shout outs where I have a shout out to two people in the chat, as well as 24 other people that hung out in person with me in Portland, including James Thompson and Erica Ensign. Nobody told me. I know because it was an incomparable thing. I've been on Incomparable once or twice because I was on the game show one time. Yes, but we had a big get together and it was glorious and amazing and absolutely incredible. It's so great to see people in person that you have either only hung out with online or it's been more than seven years. Yeah, so that was fun. They also brought so much love and support into the stressful planning side of things, which was wonderful. But yeah, I got to unicorn all over the weekend and it was glorious and I can't believe it's over. When life sucks, just unicorn all over the weekend. There we go. There's photos. What is this? Of course there's photos. What? Can't even, can't odd either. I know. Now I'm hurt physically because I banged my knee on my desk twice since we started doing this show. I don't have a shout out. Shout out to all the super awesome people hanging out with us live in the chat who are having a great time at our expense. Yes, exactly. All right, how about a connection check? Ow. Jay, how'd you do? Yeah, my connection was to get my internet connected in my potential new house. And they haven't canceled their internet yet, so I cannot get internet yet. But I did take that as an opportunity to get all the other things switched on Relay FM. And so I gave myself a yellow or orange circle. It wasn't for lack of trying. I merely just like logistically could not do it. Yeah, no, it makes sense. I almost, yeah, yellow. Good job. I have a big green check mark because the vibes, as they say, were immaculate. And everyone that was there for the incomparable weekend is sick of me saying that because I said it a billion times. Apparently, that came out in 1950 for like it was a phrase that became popular then. And I don't remember why, but there was a story on Wikipedia. So, you know, it's real. Absolute truth. But yes, big green check mark. And then this past weekend, I also had immaculate vibes. It was a weekend of glorious girl power. We saw the Barbie movie on Friday. Saturday, we were going to go to the Korean day spa, but instead decided to go see Six, the musical on closing weekend. And then Sunday, we saw Taylor Swift. We got home last night at 830 p.m. after getting home at 2 30 a.m. after Taylor. So we're exhausted. And that's okay, because I'm here with my friends. And that's that's a good part. Shall we do our Conductor's Connections? Yes, I just want people to realize that Kathy leads a very super fascinating life. I, on the other hand, have been putting things in boxes for the last week. Which is also fascinating. My body is so sore. It hurts. Everything hurts. I have paper cuts. Oh, no. Okay, now I'm just milking pity. Yeah, let's yeah. What do the Conductors be doing? I have to tell you, as soon as I can get back to our super awesome doc. And let's start with the soprano of the show, Debo, that says Greenheart, I contacted power washers, porch painters and am in the process of getting work scheduled. I read that as an M and am the princess of getting work scheduled. So congratulations, Your Highness, on getting work scheduled. Our mountain dweller of the show, Logan, has Greenheart. Sorry, sorry, Logan. I got nothing this time. It's it's fine. All the celebrations were had and were all fun. Excellent. Our Oracle of the show, Soph says, Green Apple, been spending 15 minutes on my journal, articles most days can confirm because Soph did that in our super awesome conductor co-working session. It's an awesome creativity hack and a long way from finished, but making progress. Yes. Excellent. Our panda of the show, James says, Green checkmark with the unicorn emoji. I had an excellent time on my trip to Portland. And it's a betrayal. With some of my favorite people in the world, including actually living in the same house with one, Kathy Campbell and the rest of the main house. Surprise. Well, not a surprise to Kathy, but it was so good to see everyone in person and just hang out. Absolutely. I love the fraternity sorority vibes when you when you shout main house. Yes. Well, that's because so there were three we stayed in three separate Airbnbs with a group of people and we had main house, elegant house, and quiet house. And the main house energy was very particular. You had to be there. But if you were there, you'll never forget it. Yeah. Oh, I totally wish I was there. Speaking of someone who was there. Anyways. Okay. The Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica says, Green Tree survived the road trip somewhere and got to see a unicorn and a panda. Okay. Now you're all just rubbing it in and it's not fair and I don't like it. Didn't overdo it and came home healthy, but tired. I love this for y'all. I'm so excited. If one more person talks about it in these connection checks, I'm ending the show. No one else is talking about in the connection check, but also you missed the very important line from Erica about the multiple flights of tiny, adorable cocktails, because in Portland, there is a cocktail bar that is sponsored by a specific vodka company. I don't remember the name of the vodka, but I remember the name of the bar. But you can go and they have like, they call them like tiny cocktails, mini cocktails. They are basically like a third the size of a regular drink, but all with incredible different flavors. So you can try a bunch of little ones. And yes, I think you're right, Erica, dregs vodka, but they had like a pickle, dill pickle flavored. They had like fruit loops, cereal, an orange creamsicle like blended thing. And then some of the proceeds help underprivileged youth in Portland. Chinese five spice, all sorts of different flavors with little things on top. I came home with a couple little plastic mermaids. It was just an absolute delight. If you are in Portland and have a chance to go to tiny's or teeny's, it's T I N I apostrophe S. Highly recommend. So much fun. And more and more of us showed up at like it started with just Annette and I. And then it they the people kept coming and we ended up with like half of the group around this tiny little place that was super empty. So it was super fun. Highly enjoy it. Anyways, moving on the nameless of the show has a green square. I was successful in exercising self control regarding screen time while at work. Instead of having video shows and movies playing in the background, I primarily chose to listen to music. I also discovered that I could enhance my focus on important tasks by using white noise when necessary before switching back to music. Also, Mocha and I have gone to our first puppy training class. Very important update to this as well. Mocha made an appearance on the coworking meeting and she is very fast. At first, I thought you were going to say that Mocha also was in Portland. Our trained enthusiast of the show, Relsie says, it appears I have stopped stealing everyone's sleep back into the swing of work. That's OK. I'm sure the sleep that you borrowed from people, you didn't steal it, you borrowed it. I'm sure those people are happy to have it back. But also it sounds like it was much needed. So good job. Absolutely. OK, so this episode is going to be a little bit different just a little bit than pretty much everything else ever. And that you've ever heard that you've ever heard. And not just because our brains are in a very special place right now. But last night I went into the Discord and was like, hey, y'all, I'm exhausted. And Jay is slightly stressed for many different reasons. Just slightly. Just slightly. And we were like, hey, does anyone have a topic idea or like an AMA? The problem with an AMA is that you usually have to do like a lot of questions because most of the questions end up being fairly like short. So in order to have like a full episode, you would need a ton of them. However, our conductors are the absolute best and came through with some incredible questions. We have put the list of everything into the spreadsheet and we picked three to kind of delve in. So it's going to be a little bit of a mix of a show. But we're calling this well, Jay is calling this the first annual parentheses, probably conductor questions, Stravaganza. I'm not sold on the name only because the annual word, which means that it's a year. He wants to do it every 54 episodes, which is not a year because we're a fortnightly show. Even if we were a weekly show, there's only 52 weeks in a year. Right. So like what we're saying is we have no idea what this is going to be called. We don't know if we will ever do it again. But you get that now. And that is the important part of things. So we're going to start with this first incredible question from our Oracle of the show. She said they say conduit is so different from most productivity shows out there. It's real and personal and brave and both your personalities shine through, including your willingness to take different paths from the old over trodden ones. What gave you the courage to start and continue conduit? I'm guessing you knew it would be different in everything from conductors connections to the topics you talk about. How do you avoid giving into the pressure to be just another productivity show? Love someone who is also trying to walk a different path. Do you want to go first or do you want me to? I mean, we can kind of. Yeah, so this the show started because we were. Frustrated and annoyed with the entire productivity like space. It's. It's a racket. It is a racket as I turn most of the. It is a racket as I turn most of the productivity gurus out there make their money. By being by talking about productivity, which is difficult because they are trying different things in order to talk about them like. It's not no hate or shade to the rest of the world for productivity, like podcasts and stuff out there. Now we because listen, no, we are supporting other people. However, however, we want to do something different because. We. We are different. We are not like officially full time productivity peoples. And so everything that we end up talking about is is real because it's journeys and things that we are discovering ourselves not in a journey to be productive necessarily, although obviously that is a goal. But in order like we are living our lives. We are getting stuff done. In the non. Non trademarked non trademarked. Oh yeah, because it's stuff not not things. So yeah, that's that's a new getting stuff done. Copyright 2023. Trademarked really FM switch on. By the way, about nine years ago, I had a blog that no longer exists that was called Keeping Junk Managed. Amazing. Dang. Yeah. Yeah, so I think there's like two big things for me on this like one. Kathy is right about the frustration part. There is a part of me that was frustrated with myself because, hey, I did a productivity show before then. And at times, I mean, granted, we'll say that I was significantly younger, much less stressed and very naive about the just the realities. Like I believe that, yes, there was some secret recipe of apps, gadgets and doodads that would make your life easy based on people who again do this full time. And I would definitely say that those people paint a rosier picture than you. Than what life actually looks like when you're when you're paid to be productive. You don't talk about the times in which you're not very often. And when you do, it is done in a way that it's so rare that people feel like it's just the outlier. It's like one of those things where like super, super successful person. Does a lot of drugs and you're like, wow, wow, that's real. That's super. It's like, no, that's no like what they've done is they've they've positioned the bad thing in a way that's kind of minor in the grand scheme of a thing when it's really just a bad thing. And what I noticed, you know, doing my own show for five years, I think it was like five or six years, was that people benefited from not feeling alone. People benefited from not thinking something was wrong with them. Because because that was that's the problem. People go to these productivity podcasts and videos and all this other stuff. And they go, there must be something wrong with what I'm doing, or there must be something wrong with me because I can't get the same output or productivity as this person who, you know, gets on a show every week and makes tens of thousands of dollars just talking about how he's able to or how they're able to accomplish so many things. I mean, let's be honest, it usually is a he. I mean, yeah, you're not wrong. So I think I originally reached out on, I guess, what's now called X. I'm just going to call it Twitter. I don't care. I reached out on Twitter about like, hey, I want to do a show, but I want to co-host because I can only bring my perspective and I would really love a second consistent perspective. At the same time, I believe Kathy sent out a tweet about, hey, would love to do a productivity show that felt real. And I had known Kathy from before because I had worked with Kathy previously and I was a big fan and was like, oh, this is perfect. Like, there's no way Kathy would ever want to do this. And then in the end, Kathy was like, yeah, sounds cool. And the rest is their story, I guess. I don't know. Something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And there's something to be said for trying to make sure that we are not the manufactured, what's it called? Where like you're faking mistakes or like... So Rachel Hollis is a perfect example of this type of person where they are like, she starts out, she does a podcast on YouTubes and stuff and I don't watch her. I tend to watch commentary channels talk about her so she doesn't get my views. But it's like a manufactured mistakes. Like, oh my gosh, I'm so silly. I use toothpaste instead of sunscreen. So anyways, when I wake up at 5 a.m., I know that I'm the most... Like, no one else works harder than me type of a situation. And that's not how we wanted to be. We want to make sure that we are showing just enough of our true selves because again, and pod daddy Stephen Hackett had a really good point when we did our trials, our test episodes to make sure that we are not opening ourselves up too much, that we still like have some boundaries. And I think we've done a pretty good job with that. I don't feel like I've ever gone too far into anything. I'm comfortable with the lines that I've made and where I'm at and our connections with our conductors. I think it's something special that we've been able to create a true community in something that seems to be showcasing this hole that there is in the productivity space. What I love about our conductors is just how absolutely passionate they are about what we're doing and the community that we're building. And this energy of authenticity and not being afraid to be real and to be yourself is so important to me. And that definitely is what gives me the energy to keep going because we want you, if you are listening to this, hi. Hi, you. I love you. Hello, you. I want you to know that you are important. The work that you are doing is valued. The things that you are providing to it is absolutely worthwhile. But more than that, you as a person are valuable in this space. Your worth is not dependent on what you are providing to the world. Your worth is absolutely part of who you are. Even if you just wake up today and you're in bed and that is all you are doing, you are absolutely successful. You are being productive because you are still present in the space. And we absolutely love you and adore you for that because it's important to remember that your worth as a human is not dependent on what you get done. We know everyone has a different journey that you're on. We're not all in the same storm. We are sorry, we're not all in the same boat, but we are in the same storm. We're here to try and help give you a little bit of extra... I don't know where I'm going with this. Clearly, I'm so tired. Pass it. Pass it. Pass it. I'm here. Pass it to you. All right, ready, tag. So going back to one thing and then we can move to the next question. Yes, the conduit trials, as we will call them. Um, I mean, it was, it felt very much like an audio, audio vlog type situation at the beginning. And honestly, I was like, you know, that's, that's cool. I would still love to do something like that in the future or whatever, but this show became way more than that. I mean, when I have to explain to people what conduit is, like publicly, they're like, like, how, like, what does that look like? How does that feel? And it's like, we've seen people publish books, not because of conduit, but with, with a little bit of help, with a little bit of reminder and accountability. We've seen people plan weddings. We've seen people buy houses, decorate, you know, pick up pets. It became the, the life vlog of everyone else around us, the people listening. And like, we got to be flies on the wall for all of those things, which is just incredible. And I think, you know, when they say like, what, what gives us the energy to keep going? It's, it's people checking in every single week. Like when you, when you don't see someone's check in or connection check, like you're like, oh, I hope they're okay. Like there's no, there's no podcast that I have ever listened to that has that same feeling of like, if, if there are people that disappear for a while, if there are people that come back after disappearing for a while, it's almost like, no, let's take a second and catch up and hear how it's been and what's going on and, and doing so many things. Like I, I, I was very hesitant on the idea of, you know, eventually our show would just become a whole like regular check-in for people. But honestly, like that really is like the best part of just hearing how people are living life and hearing that people don't get it, you know, a hundred percent of the time. And they're okay with telling people that I think the world would be so much better if people just admitted when they didn't do things the right way or when they didn't know the answer and things like that. But we're, we're so poised to either be a professional or capitalize off of other people's mistakes and not our own. And this show has just consistently been the buck against that trend. And I am here for it. Like every other week when we actually do the show. And again, you know, we always joke about the like, Hey, become a member. We'll move to weekly or whatever. But like, I think as long as we can keep the energy of what the show is now, I don't care how often we do it, as long as we're doing it. Absolutely. And I want to make sure too, that we're trying to lower the barrier of entry to become a conductor, not just like a superconductor. Yes, great. We would love to have your money from you. But like, more importantly, if you are listening to this and you're scared to submit a connection, I get it. That's okay. Like you are still valid and we're here for you. I want to make sure that we're here to support you. And that's why we do that our connection checks so that we can cheer you on and celebrate your wins with you because it's important. I think a lot of our society doesn't take the time necessarily to support the wins. And we want to celebrate that with you. And so it's super easy to do. We still have the Twitter thing, but that's not the best. If you want to go to feedback and submit your connections through feedback, you can go to relay.fm slash conduit slash feedback and that will go through the feedback. And so you don't necessarily have to be a member of anyone on Relay FM Switch On. But we want to make sure that you are comfortable with where you're at. So if you haven't submitted a connection before and you'd like to, we would love to hear from you. If it's been a while, absolutely take some time. We want to know how you're doing. Even if you don't know what to do, it's okay to just to even have your connection be figure out my connection for next time. That's okay. If you don't pay us, that's okay because you'll just hear an ad. Yeah, it's fine. Yeah. Yes. Also the email conduit fm at gmail.com does still exist and work and sometimes we even check it. Thanks, Railzy. Does that forward to us? No, we probably should. But right now it's just kind of like our Cotton Bureau supplies, which is a quick reminder of, hey, did you know we have merch? We have shirts and sweatshirts and hoodies and that sort of thing. But we also have stickers. We have a variety of different stickers that kind of lean into the inside jokes, but also you can proclaim your love of being a conductor. Some really great stickers out at, oh my gosh, what is it? Uconnwearit.com Y-O-U-C-O-N-W-E-A-R-I-T.com I just realized that that could be difficult to spell, but that's okay because we can spell some words.

At the end of every sponsor ad, I like to say thanks to someone out there listening in a different place in their language. And this time I picked randomly. I will probably not do that again. I say that every time. This time it is in Samoan, which is faafetai. There we go. Thank you. All right. You want to read our next question? Yeah. This question came from the never floundering fishy guy. How do you arrange your office to be more productive? If Jay is comfortable talking about it, how do I hope my new office will look and feel like? Okay. Since I was asked, I'll jump in first. The so my current office wasn't specifically designed to be quote unquote more productive. It was designed to be able to produce content in a way that was as easy as possible, which I guess is the definition of productivity in my case. I have or I had because now everything is getting packed up. So many things that were mounted so that I could swing them in and out of position. Like my microphone is mounted on an Elgato low profile mic arm. So when I'm not using it, I can just kind of push it to the side and it's off the desk. I had mounts for multiple cameras so I could do multiple camera angles, including one from my phone with a MagSafe mount and one for my actual mirrorless camera and then my webcam. So I could technically do like three different camera angles with any video that I wanted to do. And then I just staged my background so that I looked fancy and that I didn't have to. I used to have a green screen while I still have a green screen, but I used to have to like pull down my green screen or I would have to have to set up my camera like on a tripod and then like be facing a different wall that was kind of like where I would present. And I genuinely think that both of those solutions are valid. One of the things that we're actually talking about doing in our new place is one, my office is just my office. Currently, I share my office with my spouse. So I will have my own office. It will just be my office. And then there is a possibility that I will also have a private recording room that is basically only for recording audio. And it's not just a closet like it was for so many years for me. Like it'll be an actual space where I'll probably do audio and video in there. But that'll allow me to have like a separation of concerns when I'm doing audio stuff. I can go into my audio space. I'll have a dedicated machine that's just focused on recording. And then when I'd same thing for video. And then when I'm at my desk doing jobby job things, then I will have a much clearer desk with less things strewn about. And then I guess the only other thing I can add before I give it to Kathy is this past year I invested in a portable monitor. Such a good investment. I can't even explain when you need a reference monitor. And it's something that you can literally pick up and move. And it's still like 18 inches. So it's definitely like it would be too big if it were a laptop, but it's definitely small enough that if I just need to move over somewhere, right now I'm using it as my primary monitor because all of my other computer equipment is packed up. And it's just so helpful whether you're on the go, whether you just need a second monitor to monitor chats and things like that. Would highly recommend they're like less than $100. And if you're an Apple user, they can usually support power over Thunderbolt. So it's like a one cable solution. Such a good investment. Kathy, what about you? It's amazing. So I might... Right now my office is an absolute mess. And so it's not as productive of a space as I would like to be. However, I still make space for the things that I need. So every week one of my clients comes in, or they don't come in. I get in the mail from FedEx their mail to scan and file and name and ship off to them to be able to review and look at and that sort of thing. I have the scanner on my desk 24-7 and it lives right here. So I can just flip it up, flip it open, and then it automatically will already be connected. It's all set, ready to go. I also have a label maker because I do shipping for clients. I used to take it out of the drawer every time that I needed it. So it didn't fill in the things. Like, I used to delay shipping out packages because it was so rough to like unload it from the drawer and I just was like, uh. So it just stays connected or it doesn't actually stay connected to my computer, but it always stays plugged in. So all I have to do is attach the USB-A cable to my computer when I'm ready to do it. I don't have enough. I have a 8-slot external USB port hub thing, as well as all of the slots on the back of my iMac Pro and they're all full. So I can't keep it logged in at all times. It goes into where my headphones go right now because my headphones are a USB-A plug too. But that being said, I try and keep the space to the right of my desk open for my bullet journal with my pen. So I have my to-do list right there. Other than that, you know, specific cables for charging, pens available. I've got the little dongle thing for my camera card readers, that sort of stuff. I try and keep things out and visible so I see them, so I use them. But it also does make it more cluttery. So it's definitely not a magazine-worthy desk, but that's okay because it's how I get things done. Or at least try to. I love it. What is something that you... What's a thing that you've been looking at for a while that would just take your productivity over the top for your office? I have been looking at a standing desk, specifically one that I can have a treadmill underneath. My work situation with a particular client may be changing in the coming weeks, which would require more at-the-desk work situation. So it's possible that I might need to look into and make a final decision for that sooner rather than later. But we'll see how that goes. I'm unsure, but that is the one thing on my list to possibly get done. But then I would also lose all of the drawers, except if I keep them... I don't know. I have a lot of choosing, decision-making. I don't know. Who knows what will happen in the future. And then in the long-term future, I want to, in our very small backyard, build an ADU unit for my desk or for my office, which would be bigger than our 9 by 11 space that I am currently in. And that would be great. And then I would have this bedroom back to allow Ryan to have a space that has a door to close, which would be nice. But that's even further down the way. So who knows what's going to happen in the future. Yeah, absolutely. I just want it quiet. I've been looking at so many professional soundproofing solutions. I think that's what I would do is I would completely soundproof my office just so that it's quality controlled audio and I wouldn't have to deal with too much reverb or echo. I wouldn't have to deal with outside noises. The amount of time I would save just not having to dereverb things, but then also the level of anxiety that I would get, I would remove with just not being able to hear people walking through the hallway or if my daughter has something on in her room and I can hear it because the walls are thin, like, oh man, if I could just walk in and just be dead quiet. And then I know that the only thing people will hear is my voice, no echo, no anything else. Yeah, that would be pretty amazing. This episode of Conduit is brought to you by HelloFresh.

Our thanks to HelloFresh for the support of this show and all of Relay FM. And this time around we are using Creo, which not Creole, Creo. I don't know what sound this letter makes. So we're going to say tenki and just go, go from there. If I got it right, let me know if I got it wrong. If you're going to be nice about it, let me know. All right. So Jay, I know we texted about not let's just do a quickie for this one because we did talk about having three questions at the top of the show. Sure. So bonus, what is it called where you do it fast? Lightning. Lightning round. Lightning round from Rosemary. That, yeah. Give me one go to snack activity and show for when you're exhausted. Do I even have to say it? Is it Mario Kart? No, it's Tetris. Absolutely. It's 100% Tetris. And I almost got a Tetris tattoo this past week and I didn't. And I didn't. So really quick, quick story. I sat there and I had one idea and then I was like, you know, but I'm kind of flexible on the idea. So let's just play around with it a little bit. So literally on an iPad, the artist and I had each of the Tetris pieces and we were sitting there trying to put them together in a way that would be fun and cool looking for a tattoo. So we were literally sitting there basically playing Tetris. And we did that for an hour. And then afterwards we were like, yeah, we're closing. I was like, oh, my bad. Maybe I'll come back. So I don't know. We never figured out what Tetris idea I'm going to get. I'm probably going to get something. Just don't know what yet. So yeah, I'm very excited. Well, and this next week I'm getting a unicorn tattoo and I'm very excited. Oh, man. We still haven't seen anyone get those conduit tattoos. I know. Come on. Show us your conduit tattoos. I almost got the conduit logo, but I got really worried about all the intricate linework. And I was like, yeah, it's a pretty complex. You'd need a very, very good straight line. Draw. Maybe I'll just get a tire. Oh, there you go. But if you know, you know. If you know, then you know. So my go-to activity usually is like cross stitch if I really need to zone out or I will read a book. I read a lot of trashy romance, which is not trash. It's delightful smut, but it's easy to read and it's like low energy. Doesn't take a whole lot to go into it, which is really nice. And my go-to snack is gummy bears. I have a big bag in my drawer that always lives there. I like to open it up and leave it open so they get stale and then they get extra, extra chewy and it's really nice. And my show, I will just like pick whatever I'm currently binging. Right now I'm binging Suits for the first time. And then when it's over, I'm going to rewatch The Good Place because I haven't seen it again in a very long time. And a friend was just watching it for the first time and I was so excited. I had forgotten. It's such a good show. It's such a good show. So good. And then of course chocolate. I don't know, James, do I have any chocolate? Okay, listen, we're going to... I'm sorry to bring you back. Once upon a time in Portland, here we go. I'm sorry, but I have to put this story out for the world to see whether or not I was in the right and if James was a terrible human being. Look what you started, James. You brought this up. This is your fault. So James very kindly smuggled chocolate from Scotland for a variety of the American, North American listeners, fans, friends, buddies, etc. One of which is a crunchy, which is the heavenly honeycomb wrapped in chocolate candy bar. It is the best invention ever. He brought a whole box full of it and says, Kathy, you can have as many as you want. And I was like, I know that these are not just for me. So you give me what I can have, how many you want to give me. And I will be so thankful for it. So I go into my room at one point and he wrote out, Hi, Kathy, in all of the crunchies. Now, I obviously needed to sleep, so I put them in a bag. Little did I know that sometime in the next day or so, he would enlist a dear friend of the show, Tiff, to pull some of those crunchies out of my bag to deliver to other people. Now, if he had not told me, I wouldn't have known because I wouldn't have known, I didn't count them. This was just the number of chocolate bars that I had. However, he chose to tell me that he went into my room or no, he enlisted someone else to go into my room to steal them and tell me this. Now, once again, if he had asked, absolutely. Sure. Yes. I gave you too many. Kathy, may I have some back? Yes. Here you go, James. You may have these back to share with other people. But no, he was sneaky and then admitted it over lunch. And in the chat right now, James says I was away. Yes. But guess what? A, we have plenty of text communications that you could have sent a text. Number two, you could have waited to do that because it's not a chocolate emergency. Anyways, AITA, yes. The answer is yes. James is the donkey butt. Right? I just I just I just want to point out why in a land full of apparently pandas and honeycomb chocolate is Scotland known for haggis. Because of the number of sheep. Well, I thought it was going to be something about butts, but you know. I mean, maybe. I don't know. I don't know. But that being said, let's move on. I do have chocolate. I will eat chocolate and I will eat it with the the rage of the Scottish panda sprinkling and leaving the salt on. Anyway. Jay, what is your connection? If everything goes right. And I mean everything. And I don't know if everything will go right. But if it goes right by the next conduit, I will have moved across the country. There is no other important task than to make sure that everything goes right. And there are even some things that are beyond my control. But I want to at least be able to say that I want I did everything in my power to make things go the right way. So that is my connection to do everything in my power. To make sure things go the right way. I have been given a pass from work. I am 100 percent focused on making this a successful move across the country. I will be on a plane this week or this weekend with a feline and a child and another human being, all of them probably crying for different reasons because they all hate confinement and planes. So I just need this to be over so I can go back to being my jovial self because I am stressed beyond all reason. Yeah. I'm going to have you put your connection. I'm going to reword it a little bit. And it's going to be just move across the country. That's going to be your connection because really that's the most important thing right now. Is to move and then you can have a big green checkmark because you will have moved because everything's going to be fine. I like it. My connection. I am going to put that I am going to recover from the month of July. I have not spent a weekend home since June, which is a very long time. And I have a single podcast scheduled on Saturday. And other than that, I have nothing planned for this weekend. And I would like to keep it that way. And so I'm going to put recover as my connection because I need to get more sleep. I need to do less screaming because I have sang along to a lot of songs at the high level of volume. And if I concentrate on recovering, then I can concentrate on the other work that needs to happen and needs to get done. And I can become more productive at the times that I am awake. Let the record show. This is not the first time Kathy has done this connection. And that's OK. But the last time she was not able to accomplish this. So I want I want everyone to have their shame quotes ready. If Kathy starts scheduling things for herself. So wow, I'm just ready. I'm ready to come in here and shame. Yeah. Yeah, that's OK. Well, if you don't get your connection, if I don't get my connection, there's a lot of big problems. I know. I know. That's why I'm ready. I'm ready to give you shame. All right. Our soprano of the show, Debo's next connection, arrange for table and chair rentals and catering for a choir party. I'm hosting in August. Oh, man. Dealing with rental companies. Good luck. And the low down dirty mountain dweller of the show, Logang, says next connection, tidy up and decorate the new home office. Love it. Oracle of the show, Soph says next connection, keeping it going. Fifteen minutes of writing every workday and try to enjoy it. I love this. Yes. Momentum. Scotland's own panda of the show, James says, now I need to actually do all the work, maybe not all of it in the next two weeks, but as soon as my jet lag wears off, I need to get back into the office and make a start on all the stuff that's been piling up while I've been selfishly enjoying myself. Self care is not selfish. But not today. Absolutely. You can do it, James. Our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica, says new connection, make it to her scary neurologist appointment and advocate for herself. She has to go to this one alone, so she needs to make a list of questions and concerns and press for more than just a wait and see approach. Her neurologist is great, but Alberta's health care system is overwhelmed. Understandable. Listen, Erica, you can do it. The scary neurologist is like, that's like a child's storybook. It's the scary neurologist. The name list of the show says in similar theme to my work theme, work time, I want to limit screen time in my personal life, not because it's evil, but because I find myself spending my personal time on my phone screen instead of my gaming screen. I have been buying video games in the last few months that I haven't played because I keep opting for the quick dopamine hit on Instagram or YouTube. Instead of setting up the racing wheel and playing Formula One, the thing that everybody apparently loves these days, or grabbing the Switch to play that game with the link and stuff. I want to enjoy playing games without sacrificing the time I have for myself and my wife. I like it. And finally, our train enthusiast of the show, New Connection. In some major personal news, I'm moving to my first ever own house. It's a lovely apartment I'm renting. I'm hopefully getting the keys for the place at the end of the month. So my connection is to get those keys and look around the place again to find what's there and what's not. Bonus connection, start the moving process. It's an exciting time. Me too. Heck yeah. Everyone's moving. Everybody's moving. Everyone is cool when you're hauling your stuff. I don't know.

Yes, we did.
