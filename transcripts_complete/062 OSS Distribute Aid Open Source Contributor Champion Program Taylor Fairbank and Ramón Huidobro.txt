So if you see me moving around it's because I'm trying to figure things out for her. Yeah that's wonderful I was what I love about the as Ramona saying the vibes of this stream it's just like very chill like they're plenty of days that I'm on with your Ramona is like not my best day you know I'm dealing with a stressful shipment or something like that
I was what I love about the as Ramona saying the vibes of this stream it's just like very chill like they're plenty of days that I'm on with your Ramona is like not my best day you know I'm dealing with a stressful shipment or something like that You're like hey I got this like I can run you know the the good pod and like let's just like do some fun you know like react coding
You're like hey I got this like I can run you know the the good pod and like let's just like do some fun you know like react coding But exactly and this is the whole point of it isn't it it's to like you know let ourselves like we're a team here and yes we're a team like yes the three of us are a team can I say that safely now
But exactly and this is the whole point of it isn't it it's to like you know let ourselves like we're a team here and yes we're a team like yes the three of us are a team can I say that safely now Yes yes from what I've heard Jen's accepted we got to you know get her a kind of volunteer what are we going to call them volunteer agreement there we go but do you want to make the big announcement Jen or Ramona
Yes yes from what I've heard Jen's accepted we got to you know get her a kind of volunteer what are we going to call them volunteer agreement there we go but do you want to make the big announcement Jen or Ramona I'm gonna I'm gonna let Jen announces this is this I'm doing some things and stuff and we're building a cool program for open source developers to become not distracted by their dog and it has a yeah you should probably just explain it Ramona because between that and what Nick Nick said I'm like what is going on at the moment but I'm doing cool things with you that's what I know very much it's it's in the devise yeah can I jump in here Ramona I'm super excited I'm thrilled to be working with Jen so uh love that are we are we still here you're still here now you're gone for a second fabulous my bag carry on yep so Jen is our new developer advocacy coordinator and if you all remember the last thing the last year Ramona I very kind of briefly introduced the the start of an open source dev champions program and Jen's gonna be taking lead on building that out so excited to to be working with her I know that she does a lot of great work in the dev community and it's really connected to a lot of they're like we share a lot of mutual friends and contributors and stuff and uh yeah there's just some really great stuff going on at DA in 23 we're kind of collectively taking a step back as an org like we put numbers on the board bro I'm excited we sent 20 trucks of food in December got it organized got it fun and do we have that visualized somewhere is there a tab I could be sharing Instagram is probably your best we don't have a visualization up for it yet we're still building out the data pipeline but um if you want to show our Instagram I think we're just distributed on there um I have to admit I'm not very experienced with it's the ground but I hope I got this right I tell Instagram because it's like a quick like visual overview right it's just a bunch of photos um so do we have a post about it I might have yeah USA no I don't know one of those guys maybe maybe that hasn't been posted and the stream gets the first peak at what's you know fabulous point being it's enough to feed 30,000 Ukrainians every day for a full month those 30,000 needs met right there and I think what we realized is like we've done what we can in terms of scaling check right we don't have anything to prove to anyone anymore and we're gonna handle stuff um and so now it's time to take a step back really work on the fundamentals really build out the pieces that we wish we were there right now so that we can do even more in the future and I feel like that's what Jen's gonna be doing here on our tech side right how do we get organized how do we support our contributors right how do we give people ownership of different parts of our code bases um how do we get help as maintainers right because like I can contribute or maintain it's hard to do both you know um and how do folks contribute to distribute a level up by doing it so absolutely thrilled to be working with you on that um and we'll continue building it out on the open so everyone's audience keep showing up keeping in part of the DA community keep contributing and tell us what you want to get out of this dev champions program this is so exciting just as I have up everyone um especially those who are tuning in on teach gen tech we will be streaming on both channels because we definitely want to bring the awareness of distribute aid to teach gen tech crew and also just making sure that uh y'all keep up with all the random shit i'm learning so uh making sure that it's on both channels so if you get confused i am working on making the the graphics so you know what you're tuning in to for the day i love that actually i got inspired and that's why i had a little moment of blip you might have noticed jannon Taylor that i also had a mites channel to this so now we're reaching a couple of people yeah welcome new people i don't know why do you need to do this sooner like i'm such a mess but hey we're here howdy everybody it's been a while that's no el in the chat happy new year no well good to see you no well is here yes happy new year noelle hey good to see you yeah um well before we go into talking a little bit further about what we'll be do it what what gen will be doing as a developer advocacy coordinator did i get the title right you got it right yeah first try too i'm proud um let's cover a little bit of what you have been up to Taylor in the last couple weeks with distributed what i hear there's a an impending launch of sorts yes so um couple of exciting things like i said on the aid side where got a surge of um kind of end of year shipping as tends to happen so working on wrapping those up but i mean got a full truck of medicine out to Ukraine had um you know i i think a cale truck in northern France arrived at the 20 trucks of food that's so wrapping that one up um and yeah and then getting ready for for new shipping stuff and it's it's going great i haven't done thrilled absolutely thrilled with the team's doing but what they're excited about right they can do as much shipping as they want to do they're excited to document what they've learned they're excited to you know get that knowledge out on paper both for future d a logistics coordinators future d a admins but also for our communities to learn with us um and folks have been working really hard on our tech this year this is why we do open source tech right because we have that solution there are so many folks including grat can noelle have contributed to the distributed codebase and so we're also trying to get those across the finish line with this next launch um and then kind of have a clean slate to look at our 20 23 road map so Ramon do you want to show everyone what's on the cards right now with pleasure so i see a couple new things on our website um Taylor cool to just sort of leave through them and do some discovery for example the world so we've got we've got our so we've got the routes we had before the regions are new um let's have a look at those my oh my so now we've got cool new graphics for each of the regions uh-huh i was so happy because we had the google map screenshots up there is like a placeholder and our admin team got so inspired that one of them went and created like they found you know all the different maps and kind of loaded it up and added the colors and everything yeah yeah definitely this is super cool Taylor and and and you know it kind of like it kind of reminds me of our spinning earth you know like like it's round like the planet and this is like you're up France i think the data needs to be updated because it says France has a population of zero it's still working in progress so you know i'm pretty sure it's a little bit more than that yeah but it's all good it's all good this looks fantastic thank you and in like thank you everybody there's so many people that contributed you know to the like Ramanar remember almost a year ago like kind of starting to build out the early stages of this with you um there's so many people if you click in on the region pages that have contributed to uh making that happen right and it's hard to like i'm in like the really lucky position of being able to integrate a lot of people's work right and kind of give it a consistent set of styling or whatever you know but this is a my code i'm just like stitching together all of these PRs that have been merged in you know and and just trying to get them launched and across the finish line here so yeah i do have a question for you and Jen and anyone in the audience on experimenting if you scroll up with this sort of like unique menu format right it's a little bit of um you know like uh it wears like dot dot dot right like i have a some Wikipedia or something if you have like no bread crumbs yeah so how do you all feel about that kind of style for bread crumbs and maybe click on one of the subregions as well to see how it works for them yeah so we got all regions this is the current region which is eastern europe interesting because it goes like this and then like it shows where we are and then these are the subregions let me click on one i'll click uh oh goodness uh we'll go with the Romania what maybe a little bit of styling adjustments on the subregion pages it looks a bit close together there this one here you mean or like yeah like like i'm at the navelings like the arrow seem kind of close to uh to the wings there or something interesting um yeah i am only the only thing i can uh i don't know if i would necessarily register that's what it meant um yeah like uh what um what bedrock said of like i could get used to it but i think um if i like if there was a word that was added to it like here oh yeah like something to like get people used to that emit that icon yeah um and then like if you started using that more often eventually it could be so low yeah no i and that's what i'm asking for is like are people gonna understand this as bread crumbs or do we need to help frame it better or you know just the design because there's a little bit of a weird one which i i thought was like i was playing around with it yesterday and i thought it was kind of fun um but uh yeah like if people don't know that Romania is an eastern Europe that can feel kind of random right like yeah oh yeah that's what i want is for it to say the city your country or with it yes yeah yeah yeah holding bedrock layout says it's not a common icon across web so i think a few more hints as to what that means would work which is solid um which is a solid tip thank you and i think by the way i love that we have an image for it too super cool um i think what i'm missing just from an accessibility perspective is some kind of like are you able yeah definitely i kind of wanted to like see if it would make sense first and then go in and do a second yeah yeah yeah that's the styles and and add accessibility but good to call that out right yes totally yeah yeah but this is this is this is this is very like a very cool concept and we've got a question from nigger result is SEO important in general or like well um they asked earlier about react versus um i think next okay um we haven't gone over too much of like what we're using um so nigger result what are you looking for is it just like a curiosity of like the languages we use and why that's going into SEO and how we do that like what are you overall wanting to learn about if i may venture an attempt here i think SEO is going to have its relevance if people are looking for say how do how do um distribute aid in for example moldova in for example still back yet so having those relevant pages be um SEO powerfully SEO ish is i think that's the correct term yes is is relevant i think it's different like parts of this site works more or less to relevant or i think um what i think what i definitely use region pages to try and have contact with trying to um get them out there um to general public to be helpful um something like our connection right we're also like the site very much exists for our network right and so we send people extra directly and refer them to information on the site or two different tools that we put out through the site so it's kind of a weird hybrid of like it's our public landing site right and we want people to discover it but we're also like almost more concerned about using it to support our network you know as the interface to our knowledge and to our tools that extends yeah makes sense to me um yeah no super super cool this this is this is stunning work Taylor but of course it's only one part of it because there's also a needs tab shall i shall i jump into that or was there something i missed here no worry all right let's do it let's look at the needs page real quick and this whoo this is the big one um why don't you got us through a little bit Taylor right on so i want you to start i got to foot these on the actual thing let's just scroll down and take a look at our first graph that we're putting out here right this is our our needs data explorer and before we dive into all the options we now have a full year's worth of digitally collected um like kind of needs assessment survey results right um and that's enough data to start doing yearly capacity planning and really trying to get ahead of needs you know go ask for those big end-time donations for something that will need six months from now right because we know what that looks like um and this is information we definitely use internally but we want to make it actionable right so when i talk about you know how are people going to use this um you know this is clearly a fairly advanced view but it lets our coordinators or let's kind of power users put together um the view that they need to show people so remote here's a um uh oh my power just came back on i'm not going to drop out of the stream now oh my god oh fantastic yeah folks if you were if you were wondering poor Taylor comes on to the onto the stream and he's like i'm so sorry y'all i might drop halfway through because i'm tethering from my phone so things should get a little bit more stable now at least for internet so yay thank goodness for that yeah i got a question from building bedrock layout who says the main lending area should be SEO friendly right but as you go deeper maybe not as much and i think i think the important part there is what the what the purpose of the lending site is which is to sort of like bring awareness to distribute it itself overs and what it does what they do over say the what distribute it does in a specific region yeah yeah i think that's the question that that SEO we care about is like we do this globally right so we're not actually the experts on like the the conflict in the crane right now right we we send aid to our partners like we have our own setup that you know handles our response there um but we're not more knowledgeable than the one or another people that are putting out news like very detailed large reports um but if you're if you're the right type of group right if you're a grassroots group trying to help out right help refugees in Europe help natural disasters in the us want you to discover this right and we want you to understand that we can help you right as that sort of like kind of ideal user um and then like if you want to dive deeper if you're like oh i work in northern France you can check out you know who we work with in northern France kind of other information about our response on that region's page so i agree i like this approach of like generally SEO friendly for the landing site part of it but also you know like like there's a funnel right we want to guide people to the right part of that funnel and different areas of the site that not everything needs to be perfectly discoverable on its own you know let's get people in the front door and then guide them to the right thing so is that like is that the exact same spot that's the extra binding means a little bit i'm just trying to be like this one we're trying to do i don't know no same same no you're you're you're good um cool okay so this is so sorry back to the needs bar chart so this is this is a piece of functionality you're working on that allows us to share essentially from all of the data that that is being accumulated by distributed as a as they coordinate this rate eight relief to be able to be presented in a way that is sort of modularized in that folks can create their own links and visualizations and display dating a court accordingly is that correct exactly yeah we want to make the data actionable we've been you get a net dog food in this data and and definitely like you get to get in kind of agents you get to make talks between people now it's too publicized it but just say oh great we like let me survey it and get actionable so run if you scroll that's up with the no exceptions really quick tailor and i don't know if it's just me i was just typing to you to all of you yeah um is your internet back on because you're breaking up pretty bad and i don't know if you can swap to your like normal internet yeah i could try doing that um for sure give me a second here remote if you want to go indexed by item right and select a region like just play around with the settings here not not on the group by but on the filter right try to get like like how would you use this data to to make it actionable have fun i'll be back in two minutes and then take a time to see what folks do awesome thank you yeah i mean so this so for context everyone like this is something that that tailor started like briefly showing off as the end of the year came around and like it just went from there so this is a way for allowing you folks who are working you know this data is open and free for folks to be able to experiment with and so for example if i pick indexed by item all of the items that are in uh eastern europe and we can see there a breakdown of all of these items just like all the way down and you can see what folk like what folks are uh bringing over around say in eastern europe um this is the last conversation um so when you hear ready remote i just sent you a photo oh yeah like i think a way that it'll be easier for that icon to make sense so since you're sharing your screen i just sent it over to you yeah i can open that i love it i love it i think about janmita oh okay just putting the icon by each of them i think would show oh that means that it's by it like that means that that's there jenn jenn so cool jenn this is and um in case anyone is curious this is why i love streaming with these two is because my ADHD self is going to be off in like law law land where at least they can continue going and i'm not slowing the conversation because i oh yay welcome everyone from learn with jason oh hello what up yay and um we are working with distribute aid and we are currently streaming to a few of us so that way we can go through and uh taylor talk about what distribute aid is we're gonna have to do that the best that the things we don't ever do so distribute aid um i'm a confident person we don't know but i i feel like i can say it and if we learn otherwise that's okay we run the world's largest mutual aid supply chain so let's break that down the world global scale we operate in the united states in the europe including eastern europe and in lebanon right now we're very much designing our supply chain and are tacking away that like eventually can reach most places on this planet because we deal with global crises right um you know i think kovid really taught us that one uh mutual aid we're interested in solidarity not charity um you know we're we're not interested in like sending things because like like livid makes us feel good or because like we have like the resources to do that we're interested in building systems that help people and using supply chains and technology to do that um and and figuring out how to do that at scale and like a scale well you know starting with grassroots all the way up to like how do these networks help everybody together um and supply chain um we ship things remote if you can jump back to our uh Instagram real quick trucks containers you know palettes uh we just tend to stay away from individual boxes and things like that but yeah just scroll through a little bit um so we uh i think we operate in about 12 countries um and uh do some really interesting um logistics and and supply chain work um we deliberate right and we do that at the scale of uh 15 million dollars um from an all volunteer team um so yeah and uh to add to you that really quick because i know a lot of people were uh watching Jason with um Daniel about next and we do so i'm probably the least technical here and these two are like super technical so yes we may be using all this as a focus on open source with distributed aid to put it towards you know a good resource yet there are a lot of um of it is the technical side of it and we use it as a teaching platform as why we're also working on launching a new project that we just announced today that we will be if you think of something like Microsoft's champions or i forget what they're all called or GitHub or you know there's the museum with the tech speakers right that are amongst the world
I'm gonna I'm gonna let Jen announces this is this I'm doing some things and stuff and we're building a cool program for open source developers to become not distracted by their dog and it has a yeah you should probably just explain it Ramona because between that and what Nick Nick said I'm like what is going on at the moment but I'm doing cool things with you that's what I know very much it's it's in the devise yeah can I jump in here Ramona I'm super excited I'm thrilled to be working with Jen so uh love that are we are we still here you're still here now you're gone for a second fabulous my bag carry on yep so Jen is our new developer advocacy coordinator and if you all remember the last thing the last year Ramona I very kind of briefly introduced the the start of an open source dev champions program and Jen's gonna be taking lead on building that out so excited to to be working with her I know that she does a lot of great work in the dev community and it's really connected to a lot of they're like we share a lot of mutual friends and contributors and stuff and uh yeah there's just some really great stuff going on at DA in 23 we're kind of collectively taking a step back as an org like we put numbers on the board bro I'm excited we sent 20 trucks of food in December got it organized got it fun and do we have that visualized somewhere is there a tab I could be sharing Instagram is probably your best we don't have a visualization up for it yet we're still building out the data pipeline but um if you want to show our Instagram I think we're just distributed on there um I have to admit I'm not very experienced with it's the ground but I hope I got this right I tell Instagram because it's like a quick like visual overview right it's just a bunch of photos um so do we have a post about it I might have yeah USA no I don't know one of those guys maybe maybe that hasn't been posted and the stream gets the first peak at what's you know fabulous point being it's

like they found you know all the different maps and kind of loaded it up and added the colors and everything yeah yeah definitely this is super cool Taylor and and and you know it kind of like it kind of reminds me of our spinning earth you know like like it's round like the planet and this is like you're up France i think the data needs to be updated because it says France has a population of zero it's still working in progress so you know i'm pretty sure it's a little bit more than that yeah but it's all good it's all good this looks fantastic thank you and in like thank you everybody there's so many people that contributed you know to the like Ramanar remember almost a year ago like kind of starting to build out the early stages of this with you um there's so many people if you click in on the region pages that have contributed to uh making that happen right and it's hard to like i'm in like the really lucky position of being able to integrate a lot of people's work right and kind of give it a consistent set of styling or whatever you know but this is a my code i'm just like stitching together all of these PRs that have been merged in you know and and just trying to get them launched and across the finish line here so yeah i do have a question for you and Jen and anyone in the audience on experimenting if you scroll up with this sort of like unique menu format right it's a little bit of um you know like uh it wears like dot dot dot right like i have a some Wikipedia or something if you have like no bread crumbs yeah so how do you all feel about that kind of style for bread crumbs and maybe click on one of the subregions as well to see how it works for them yeah so we got all regions this is the current region which is eastern europe interesting because it goes like this and then like it shows where we are and then these are the subregions let me click on one i'll click uh oh goodness uh we'll go with the Romania what maybe a little bit of styling adjustments on the subregion pages it looks a bit close together there this one here you mean or like yeah like like i'm at the navelings like the arrow seem kind of close to uh to the wings there or something interesting um yeah i am only the only thing i can uh i don't know if i would necessarily register that's what it meant um yeah like uh what um what bedrock said of like i could get used to it but i think um if i like if there was a word that was added to it like here oh yeah like something to like get people used to that emit that icon yeah um and then like if you started using that

then go in and do a second yeah yeah yeah that's the styles and and add accessibility but good to call that out right yes totally yeah yeah but this is this is this is this is very like a very cool concept and we've got a question from nigger result is SEO important in general or like well um they asked earlier about react versus um i think next okay um we haven't gone over too much of like what we're using um so nigger result what are you looking for is it just like a curiosity of like the languages we use and why that's going into SEO and how we do that like what are you overall wanting to learn about if i may venture an attempt here i think SEO is going to have its relevance if people are looking for say how do how do um distribute aid in for example moldova in for example still back yet so having those relevant pages be um SEO powerfully SEO ish is i think that's the correct term yes is is relevant i think it's different like parts of this site works more or less to relevant or i think um what i think what i definitely use region pages to try and have contact with trying to um get them out there um to general public to be helpful um something like our connection right we're also like the site very much exists for our network right and so we send people extra directly and refer them to information on the site or two different tools that we put out through the site so it's kind of a weird hybrid of like it's our public landing site right and we want people to discover it but we're also like almost more concerned about using it to support our network you know as the interface to our knowledge and to our tools that extends yeah makes sense to me um yeah no super super cool this this is this is stunning work Taylor but of course it's only one part of it because there's also a needs tab shall i shall i jump into that or was there something i missed here no worry all right let's do it let's look at the needs page real quick and this whoo this is the big one um why don't you got us through a little bit Taylor right on so i want you to start i got to foot these on the actual thing let's just scroll down and take a look at our first graph that we're putting out here right this is our our needs data explorer and before we dive into all the options we now have a full year's worth of digitally collected um like kind of needs assessment survey results right um and that's enough data to start doing yearly capacity planning and really trying to get ahead of needs you know go ask for those big end-time donations for something that will need six months from now right because we know what that looks like um and this is information we definitely use internally but we want to make it actionable right so when i talk about you know how are people going to use this um you know this is clearly a fairly advanced view but it lets our coordinators or let's kind of power users put together um the view that they need to show people so remote here's a um uh oh my power just came back on i'm not going to drop out of the stream now oh my god oh fantastic yeah folks if you were if you were wondering poor Taylor comes on to the onto the stream and he's like i'm so sorry y'all i might drop halfway through because i'm tethering from my phone so things should get a little bit more stable now at least for internet so yay thank goodness for that yeah i got a question from building bedrock layout who says the main lending area should be SEO friendly right but as you go deeper maybe not as much and i think i think the important part there is what the what the purpose of the lending site is which is to sort of like bring awareness to distribute it itself overs and what it does what they do over say the what distribute it does in a specific region yeah yeah i think that's the question that that SEO we care about is like we do this globally right so we're not actually the experts on like the the conflict in the crane right now right we we send aid to our partners like we have our own setup that you know handles our response there um but we're not more knowledgeable than the one or another people that are putting out news like very detailed large reports um but if you're if you're the right type of group right if you're a grassroots group trying to help out right help refugees in Europe help natural disasters in the us want you to discover this right and we want you to understand that we can help you right as that sort of like kind of ideal user um and then like if you want to dive deeper if you're like oh i work in northern France you can check out you know who we work with in northern France kind of other information about our response on that region's page so i agree i like this approach of like generally SEO friendly for the landing site part of it but also you know like like there's a funnel right we want to guide people to the right part of that funnel and different areas of the site that not everything needs to be perfectly discoverable on its own you know let's get people in the front door and then guide them to the right thing so is that like is that the exact same spot that's the extra binding means a little bit i'm just trying to be like this one we're trying to do i don't know no same same no you're you're you're good um cool okay so this is so sorry back to the needs bar chart so this is this is a piece of functionality you're working on that allows us to share essentially from all of the data that that is being accumulated by distributed as a as they coordinate this rate eight relief to be able to be presented in a way that is sort of modularized in that folks can create their own links and visualizations and display dating a court accordingly is that correct exactly yeah we want to make the data actionable we've been you get a net dog food in this data and and definitely like you get to get in kind of agents you get to make talks between people now it's too publicized it but just say oh great we like let me survey it and get actionable so run if you scroll that's up with the no exceptions really quick tailor and i don't know if it's just me i was just typing to you to all of you yeah um is your internet back on because you're breaking up pretty bad and i don't know if you can swap to your like normal internet yeah i could try doing that um for sure give me a second here remote if you want to go indexed by item right and select a region like just play around with the settings here not not on the group by but on the filter right try to get like like how would you use this data to to make it actionable have fun i'll be back in two minutes and then take a time to see what folks do awesome thank you yeah i mean so this so for context everyone like this is something that that tailor started like briefly showing off as the end of the year came around and like it just went from there so this is a way for allowing you folks who are working you know this data is open and free for folks to be able to experiment with and so for example if i pick indexed by item all of the items that are in uh eastern europe and we can see there a breakdown of all of these items just like all the way down and you can see what folk like what folks are uh bringing over around say in eastern europe um this is the last conversation um so when you hear ready remote i just sent you a photo oh yeah like i think a way that it'll be easier for that icon to make sense so since you're sharing your screen i just sent it over to you yeah i can open that i love it i love it i think about janmita oh okay just putting the icon by each of them i think would show oh that means that it's by it like that means that that's there jenn jenn so cool jenn this is and um in case anyone is curious this is why i love streaming with these two is because my ADHD self is going to be off in like law law land where at least they can continue going and i'm not slowing the conversation because i oh yay welcome everyone from learn with jason oh hello what up yay and um we are working with distribute aid and we are currently streaming to a few of us so that way we can go through and uh taylor talk about what distribute aid is we're gonna have to do that the best that the things we don't ever do so distribute aid um i'm a confident person we don't know but i i feel like i can say it and if we learn otherwise that's okay we run the world's largest mutual aid supply chain so let's break that down the world global scale we operate in the united states in the europe including eastern europe and in lebanon right now we're very much designing our supply chain and are tacking away that like eventually can reach most places on this planet because we deal with global crises right um you know i think kovid really taught us that one uh mutual aid we're interested in solidarity not charity um you know we're we're not interested in like sending things because like like livid makes us feel good or because like we have like the resources to do that we're interested in building systems that help people and using supply chains and technology to do that um and and figuring out how to do that at scale and like a scale well you know starting with grassroots all the way up to like how do these networks help everybody together um and supply chain um we ship things remote if you can jump back to our uh Instagram real quick trucks containers you know palettes uh we just tend to stay away from individual boxes and things like that but yeah just scroll through a little bit um so we uh i think we operate in about 12 countries um and uh do some really interesting um logistics and and supply chain work um we deliberate right and we do that at the scale of uh 15 million dollars um from an all volunteer team um so yeah and uh to add to you that really quick because i know a lot of people were uh watching Jason with um Daniel about next and we do so i'm probably the least technical here and these two are like super technical so yes we may be using all this as a focus on open source with distributed aid to put it towards you know a good resource yet there are a lot of um of it is the technical side of it and we use it as a teaching platform as why we're also working on launching a new project that we just announced today that we will be if you think of something like Microsoft's champions or i forget what they're all called or GitHub or you know there's the museum with the tech speakers right that are amongst the world Yeah there's so many so we are working on starting that but for open source so and walking through those programs so hanging out with us on Thursdays like definitely uh hit follow if you're interested in it or have input because this is something that i mean for those who are into open source this is literally for everyone and it helps people get into tech because breaking into tech is terrifying that's why i have the show called teach gen tech which yes i got my name and kind of copy learn with Jason Jason's is much more technical and minds like for for very beginners
Yeah there's so many so we are working on starting that but for open source so and walking through those programs so hanging out with us on Thursdays like definitely uh hit follow if you're interested in it or have input because this is something that i mean for those who are into open source this is literally for everyone and it helps people get into tech because breaking into tech is terrifying that's why i have the show called teach gen tech which yes i got my name and kind of copy learn with Jason Jason's is much more technical and minds like for for very beginners Yeah sure well and i feel like we hit that nice middle sweet spot right like um we're so inspired by the open source world and use a lot of concepts that came out of open source tech in our like this humanitarian aid space right and getting people to document knowledge publicly right kind of like like spinning up these like open offer community services and stuff um very inspired and we're dealing with two different solidarity economies there's the solidarity economy and the open source kind of tech space there's the solidarity economy and this kind of grassroots aid network space and um open source addi brings those two together right that's the code we write helps move atoms in the real world to support people in need and do that in a sustainable and reliable manner um so i think it's super cool but like john said like very beginner friendly like we're all volunteers we're just here to have a good time right it's got to be a good time for people to stick around you got learn and grow and you know support your own career and i think that's what john's going to really help us build out this year with the dev champions program is like you get to contribute code to an awesome open source project and you know get something to show your employer right and get a sweet story to tell you know your your teammates on the get that job or whatever um so yeah yeah all right that's the time to plug our donate page remote that's pretty new because we want to do i have to show where the all the new folks where the donate pages like our work open collectives so as always you can contribute to distribute a dot org slash donate we don't have to goodness your rights yeah yeah like i said everything we're trying to get it all out the door here we go see our different projects find out more info you can uh click donate it'll take you to the right place on the internet um if you like what we do please support it um we deliver a lot of aid and we are very efficient every dollar you donate delivers eighty seven dollars worth a humanitarian aid um and like i said we're a grassroots all volunteer open source team so and this is what Thursdays are about so definitely hang out with us on Thursdays the rest of the week is let's see monday is just like hanging out with Laura which is miscellaneous Mondays and we work through like this week we work through lighting and next monday we're going to be working through obs and on friday as we talk about tython and typescript every other friday so a lot mattering on the day you're just going to get surprised with some goodness but on Thursdays it's all distributed there we go cool uh my graphic when everybody joined in and i was like oh there's people um my i feel like a graphic like that will help with um the coordination oh this is a good one um do you coordinate with other non-profits that have similar goals yes great question um we don't want to become a big institution we're taking a very twenty first century kind of network building approach um to the organizing that we do um and we're trying to solve like supply chain almost as a utility layer right and offer different services that are open to these other groups right thinking of it more as like almost like an API layer right okay if you want to help people in your community can you tell someone your needs who are just like going out there after getting those donations you know can you like bring a pallet into some community storage um so i think um the whole point is to do this working with other people get more people involved in these kind of humanitarian and aid movements make it more accessible to them um and right now we work with over 150 organizations in a dozen different countries um so uh we're not going to expand to new regions for the next year but hoping to kind of double down on those relationships and you know help grow more groups help get more groups into uh into the aid movement and then onto our supply chain yeah something that uh comes to mind of especially about right before we were looking at um the design when you were going through uh Ramon you were going through the page where it was like the breakdown of um yeah i don't remember yeah yeah so something that i'm curious about and i know you we're looking at um behind the scenes a bit of how was this made um so the story for something like this um kind of follows our the usual tech development approach i'm going to get on my soapbox here just because uh do it how do we build something you know how did this come to happen it starts on the uh kind of aid worker side right we needed to solve a very practical logistics problem what do people need can we project that need can we use that to you know go after in-kind donors and tell them like you can't just approach a big company and say give me socks and underwear you can approach them and say in this region for this response you might care about i need 5,000 pairs of socks and 5,000 pairs of underwear broken down by these sizes and stuff like that so we just started asking people you know quarterly could you tell us what you need got a whole messy set of data built a structure and kind of went through google forms and then tried quadrics but didn't afford the license so we're like hey let's build our own tool and uh Marcus was the lead on that project um he uh built uh need assessment survey tool now and kind of a eight database you know backing that data and an API to provide summary results right we don't want to release individual group surveys but we'll release summaries for each sub-region um so huge shout out to him and i think that's a great example john as people go through our dev champions program right like contribute to the existing projects contribute to the landing site you know but really hoping to identify open source leaders through that program who can take on their own projects and help us build other tools um just like Marcus did so i kind of came in here i wanted to set the stage um because this is not the only data source we have we have a whole shipment data reporting kind of our impact reporting pipeline that we've been building out and getting data together for um but we need the capability on our landing site to show this data off so um i kind of went in and use this as my excuse to set up um you know that and we're using nivo graphs there's a ton of different types of graphs out there that people could do um and uh yeah like figured out the data ingestion through gatsby um and you know just kind of plugged it into one of those nivo graphs and then you know set up these controls right you people could even add more controls but i wanted to do one kind of end-to-end feature like this um myself to say like hey here's an example you can refer to in our code base you know here's an approach i'm i open the criticism i'm open like doing things different ways but at least here's a starting point right and again bringing that to what you're building out this is what lorith can for it who's like really excited to take some awesome interesting data and a great visualization library and and you know put the two together to come up with new graphs and new charts and help provide new answers with the data we already have who who wants to like get into the back end and work on you know kind of automating our data pipeline so that when we deliver 20 trucks of food to Ukraine that can get to the landing site the next day instead of three months later you know in a pdf quarterly report right um so i think uh we we can dive into more of what Ramon and i talked about last time but then we want to use the program you're building um to set up these pathways for contributors where they feel supported like we know we can support them we know there's an example there there's a like a code c map shout out to our sponsors at codesse um you know showing you where in the code base you're going to need to look for different things um and that help people develop their confidence and develop their skill set by giving them a structure way to contribute to d a over time and like building up their repertoire uh you know through that i think one of the things that excites me the most about this is about building this how to make into state access accessible is that it is built in such a way to make these shareable do you want to take us a little bit through this link field here yes so the first thing i want you to do Ramon go back to the top let's um change categories to items yes i do like like what what might uh let's group by subregion let's group by sublipin let's index by item that's it and then let's select grease maybe um from the filter and if we could change the sort to value and change the order i the i've messed up my tests in the order server so change it to uh maybe change it to ascending okay i didn't mess it up yes so so that's what i'm talking about right we have now taken a bunch of data and visualized it to create an answer that will get people needed items like basic humanitarian like what does it take to survive stuff right this is a list of the past years worth of data for grease ranking those items by the a number of needed items we can translate that to like monthly needs you know sometimes you need a lot of diapers but only a couple sets of clothes or something right so we can we can kind of combine it with other data sets and kind of continue to discover answers through it but like if someone's like what does grease need i want to support refugees there this is the graph that i send them and they take this and they produce you know a whole ton of amazing stuff right will produce you know kind of like like how many collection events do we need what should we tell people to bring to those collection events people take this to in-kind donors hey if your company has overstock here's the list of things will automatically accept right and we can also take this uh and use it for advocacy and highlight you know what is the size and scale of like the unmet humanitarian needs there um to agencies and governments that like might have the ability to do something about it or might not be interested in helping these people but we can at least tell them like this is the gap that you're leaving that our network is uh excuse me it was trying to fill really quick i just want to call out one of the comments that we just got uh it's homey and we all adore homey and you said coming up here yeah so um for those who don't know who homey is he is literally everyone's homey and is so supportive and one of the biggest reasons that i've been able to do what i do and he's been sick for a while so please everyone you know send him some love goodbye that kind of thing because homey's been sick for a while and um we miss him and thank you for saying hi go take care of yourself we will be around we will not fall off the edge of the world and as you get better you hit that point of lockdown where it's more boredom than sickness let me know i'm like working on all this code stuff so if you just want to chill on zoom as i code hit me up on me um but yeah no for real y'all the new covid variant like as aid workers where where covid responsible and and it's uh it's not good man uh the new one is is not good so now's the time if you're in a cab or a uber or on a bus or you know whatever like mask up when you can get the uh get the booster the bi-anvil booster um if anyone wants 200,000 masks i got them in a warehouse in Germany and i can probably ship them new for free so uh if you know what to do with that you but uh seriously like take care of yourselves right the world needs us uh happy and healthy uh so that we can uh take care of each other but homey better all the best yes yes and thank you please continue i just really want to take that opportunity yeah anyways point meing like so we have this needs assessment tool we have the data groups have been participating this empowers the people that fill up this survey to take action to send the city of supporters and remonia exactly right that link right there and codes all those filters into the url so that if you copy and paste it like if you share it on facebook whatever um you know it'll take people back to the graph you were viewing that didn't work because probably something i did with maybe it's just like difficult with gidpod to get that to work i'm not sure yeah eight thousand gidpod or ios slash we can start with the the netlify branch preview we tried out there yeah sounds good i don't wonder what happened though oh no wait ah that'll do it you'll find out that'll do it come back gidpod oh yeah that's my bad uh yeah we got a comment here i'm not sure how to share him but building bedrock says i can irresponsibly use 200 masks um but they should use for out there intended so these are cloth masks unfortunately we're having a hard time placing them so they really are just up for grabs but the minimum order size for them is going to probably be a full 40 foot container i can't break them down smaller that maybe a pallet of like 10,000 at a time it's kind of the scale that we we operate at yeah fair um so somebody has to have a garage or something to put it somewhere um because i'm gonna say i want you to probably have a warehouse that a truck can back up to is is the real answer there i was just gonna say it's not gonna fit through your front door no no that's actually a big part of our us strategy right now though is we've just started a hubs working group we have four different cities where people are setting up their own eight wires out in hubs as we've been like talking to them for a few months about this so really excited and and that's kind of the point of what we do we do a lot of this bundling to help these like really grassroots community driven groups work together to interact with the big complicated global supply chain in an economically efficient manner right so if you do just have a garage you need to call your local hub who has that warehouse that we can back a truck out to and you can reserve your pallet off of it if you have a small community distrell if you want to stock up you know to take care of your employees like whatever it is right um you know that's kind of our strategy how do we break this like very large scale aid stuff down into something that you as an individual or group of friends or a community or ten to manage the our work you're on everything's working again so now i took the link there we go my new tab put it in and there we go so an item grease and these are resherable and like i like that the colors are randomized by the way thanks yeah i've been kind of like trying to just get like basic designs up so yeah on the background of different things like the background changes and i just kind of took um you know the lighter swaths of our color scheme and have like a little background color randomizer bar chart color randomizer so that i didn't have to make decisions i'm just like a designer made this decision on what the colors are and it'll be a designer randomly and i'll be okay with that and i can be one loving loving cool um so we got we got some time left and i don't want to miss out i don't want to deprive us of like planning this uh or show like talking about this this contributor program i did get excited about Jen's idea of having the arrows next to the title Jen what do you think do you want to try and put this in uh you can drive we give you pretty things i mean you you can do it i just want to make the pretty things i say that but i mean i do but i honestly just look i don't i don't know why don't you drive and Jen can navigate like i'm like what should do and i can navigate on the like where does this live in the code is cool okay okay we do that we get a contribution by the way i learned how to do like a co-authored commits so you will get a green square i always feel bad when i rebase other people's work and it adds to me as i call up here and i'm like no i just rebased it it's okay that said rebasing is work that's true it is like that's an event container thing okay so we are looking at i'm excited um really quick i just want to like it's finished through as um the process is so that graphic already exists somewhere so would it be i would well remote-striving but like the process would be going and finding that graphic and then adding it on each side of the text or would it have to be well i was wondering does it have to be like an upload to an icon um to be able to use that way so the way i would find this out oh sorry no no i love it i i want to be able to discover it actually i'm i'm true like Jen you and i have zero like inside into this so this is like you and me discovering i love this so the way i would find out if this is like an icon from like an icon pack or something is i would inspect this element using my browser and if you see here that span class relative and there you see there's the icon so it is an html character yes that's so much easier to do right so we can take it no no direct me direct me you're the boss here well um because we would have to do it for every page though um maybe how would you do it for each of the the um it depends on how it's coded up and so the question is did i handcraft all of those different pages or is there like a template or something there where you just have to change it one spot um i my thought process is you would have done a template or what bedrock said of a component because back in the day you were trying to we were trying to do templates of something and i fell off the edge of the earth uh no you didn't so uh i would go to the code what did you call that get pod yeah get pod and i don't know if i would search or oh see i would not be the actual unit code thing right in the code it's going to be the html kind of like and whatever whatever call and oh see i would actually go through the folder structure okay because i would want to know how it's linked together um folks by the way start interrupt to gen uh as always let us know if the fun size is too small um all we gotta all you gotta do is let us know we'll make it bigger carry on gen can i make a recommendation here real quick um on the get hub pr we got the code see review maps integrated so that'll show you which files i've changed right and you can use that rather than like exploring the whole code based structure like what's a reasonable place for this thing to live right can we can we shortcut our way to to where this is good call so our sponsors uh kotees is kindly sponsoring our uh our street our our streams and our further development so they here we can get a like a visualization of which files have changed yeah and this always makes me confused because i'm still lurking working on learning like the um how to go look for stuff yeah i'm always like visualization now why but i'm normally such a visual person that this would be really helpful yeah and this is like such a large PR that it's like maybe less helpful than the usual like kind of smaller modular PRs that we do because this is integrating a lot of stuff but i think we can i think we can work our way because like building bedrock layouts is very correctly start with pages and work your way down yeah so we've got our pages here for the regions and each so we were looking at a sub region page so if we take a look here we can see which ones are being what is being used here block links list section grid gasp image i'm just gonna like poke around and see what i find and having to look um oh so it does actually give full i always thought it just gave like what the file was not that it um if you double click on it it'll it'll show you the code diff yeah i'm just gonna use all the time like if i'm reviewing someone's PR i don't usually get hub interface i go straight to kotec i kind of use the visualization to build my mental model and then step through the review looking at like the line by line diff file by file does it it it's not just like here's a bunch of files you got to sort through it's like oh i can start just like bedrock said like when we start with the page then we'll get the component the page uses and kind of mark them off as i go so then we would take the one thousand yeah and then we would put that on either side of the class yeah that yeah you read my mind so we got to go to d a sub region dot slug so it won't you change it there you can only infuse it there yeah more like the the review interface if you want to change those you gotta you know have it in your editor have it on get pod or something like that can it open from kotec to get pod for the accurate so you don't have to go search for the file again no but that's gonna be our streams uh once a week feature a class kotec team if you're watching this i want to be able to click on a get pod button right here so you open the PR and yeah that'd be really cool i get i get we will give random feedback yeah so what's the eric simons company is doing something cool that that kind of does that it'll put it in get hub so it'll like add a comment just like kote adds the comment with the map it'll add a comment to a dev environment so you can just like click the button and kind of check out the pr and it's like up and running um let me see if i can find it real quick i don't know that but that sounds really helpful and yeah i know i thought it seemed like a pod but it actually gets that level of granularity um so you'll get to the code stuff and let me see if i can't come up with uh yeah totally uh okay gen so i've done what you instructed but it looks cannot read properties of null reading remove child i probably just have to refresh a okay well okay we did take a mic and put on you there's so yeah but hey we're on the right track that that's a win a win is a win um 95 this looks like the right one what do you think yes um well can we copy and paste it into the google to verify oh that's a good call let's see that downward two headed arrow that's the one yay that way because i would end up doing it where it would end up like fixing it every time and then getting really annoyed and going oh wait yeah the other thing you did that i noticed is that you centered it oh i did center it yes which i'm not as concerned about the centering um as much as just making sure that they were on both sides and i didn't have room um with the way it previously was so i ended up just centering it because of that but centering it may look better you're right exactly so um we can give it a try let me what about spacing issues building better archaea says what about spacing should it be bigger the title or the icons because i personally like the icons the only thing that i think we should change here is in the menu um itself by regions it's putting a space between all regions in the arrow oh each region and its respective arrow yeah because uh it's it's bugging me i don't have a i feel like this is going to be like me trying to explain things so it's like i don't know what's just bugging me that's not a really good reason why probably be here right Taylor that would probably be here for each other between the oh in between the icons and heading yeah yeah the other thing you could do is you could move the span there outside and put it in the um in the kind of parent flexbox so that it has the same gap between the arrow as the as the text um so you do it either way okay well that the the prettier we'll do its thing yeah yeah you need this to probably not know i was probably just putting a div in there to have a div in there i can have it on the other one so clearly there's some copy and patient and against going on yeah that looks space here i do you like the space here can we make the menu one icon bigger this one yeah hard to select yes let's see that i'm not showing up in your browser among but you see that top negative top negative four i was trying to have that arrow intersect with the the hr there so that it would like becoming down but be attached to that kind of horizontal line so make it think like create that effect i don't know if that effect is helpful it is it is a helpful effect i think this is going to be tricky to achieve across different operating systems and browsers yeah it seems like a very hacky solution so i'm with you i'm with you i'm with you i think i think there's something i don't know yeah i do i do dig me a good hacky solution um but yeah let's let's uh text for excel all right let's make the six x out too big but hey do five did no five oh i like that and then can we center full of all of you please yes yeah and then we'll have to do the same for the region one oh yeah the region page yeah it's kind of like you know do things twice and kind of refine them and then make it modular so i think these region and sub-region pages have a lot of overlap which i need to refactor out into components oh i i i'm the same i'm the same tailor uh or to the audience if you're excited about coding at this year's date you could refactor them out to the uh the components too absolutely i need to figure out how to do tech center in tailwind unless somebody knows i'm not sure it's a tech center thing it might be a flex box thing right because i'm using like stacks of flex boxes so it might be yeah i don't know if that if that HR or if the heading goes all the way across or if it gets kind of scaled down and to make it left aligned yeah good call because it fill out i need to get out of mobile view there we go yeah see it doesn't go all the way yeah yeah to get that HR effect there um i have that 20% larger you see that with six slash fifths so i kind of potentially was having it stick out the end what you could do is maybe like you know not have it do that or something um but then it might cut off too close to the arrows you could also have left padding to the title and the subtitle to kind of like you know do like yeah you could do some publishing stuff i just committed to cry my think oh i love it oh yay oh so easy see this is what happens when you get a lazy developer on stream so if we do the same size etc done listen if we're gonna use a hack we might as well use it again yeah yeah that works yeah that's consistency right there we i'm see after my own a hardtailer exactly consistency um cool let's so i think that's i think that's established as working um what we can do now is just take this change and move it over to the other region page and then do all of that commit it and then um take a look at the the program some good yeah it sounds that sounds great Jen you good without too yeah fabulous so that's um um is this page public right now it um it's publicly available in some form like like if you go to distributed dot org slash regions it's there all the data and everything is on it publicly but we haven't launched the page yet so it's not on our like production like you want to regions or needs on our production yeah this is this is to get it up there and have the menu items be accessible on stuff so perfect that is what i needed to know yeah what am i doing here this is the arrow we wanted to make this text five excel and we've got the bigger than that need to be spaced out at the dove i think um other direction there you want that one to go above right so you want to move it outside that class flex there you go and you can just get rid of the extremist div oh yeah big fan of deleting divs thanks yes yeah went through so many like different iterations on the style that i just had like extra elements lying around those like pop in tasting on Jen and chat thoughts what what do you think this is the region page now based on your new and improved design um i like it now i have something else i don't like what's that that's what we're doing this for the and the ampersand yeah i think that's an easy fix right yeah um uh Oxford comma step oh Oxford comma separator is that something you made i read a little utility yet i love it so we could have a strict comma separator or something if you go to um source slash itils i think there's a one function string itels file there i mean that's what that's what holding command and clicking on it is for it takes us here i use sublime text still okay i'm old school i listen i'm still using vim i don't have much of an argument i don't have a foot to stand on here um so i think what we can do right is just take this yes your own call it strict comma separator or just comma separator whatever yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah get comma separator and uh well building better okay i have vscode all the way i will not argue with you vscode is extremely cool a tool um i don't think oh i see we just take out that uh if else clause right if we just remove that uh right not not the first one um okay no yeah and both of them both of them yeah you're right yeah there we go there you go gen i think i think get comma separator then we need to fix the import and if i could spell correctly it wouldn't be all my separator but comma there we go there we go what do you think i like it excellent as you play again stop and point with the uh the code stuff if we got those yes let's see get hub co author it's a little bit wordy but we can do it okay so back here uh get status we will do my favorite patching so we've replaced the comma separator and we've done our spacing yeah and of course we added it status okay that's all those are all the changes next yeah um the type script check script failing so i added them to our pre commit hook uh to to point out because like they're they're pretty invisible to me yeah using sublime text and now you got tired of like pushing commits with a simple type script like issue and then having the depth like uh the cicd shut me down so this is a fix uh tweak region and so we can yeah everything okay let's do it look building bedrock layout give us your give us your your it's uh we can do that but then we got to add building bedrock uh to the contributors yeah totally you should you should um so hold up we need first we need is your github username jen jennad yes it took a lot but yes it is why did you take a lot um because it was under it was when i first started in the tech world and it was under a work email address and luckily they still have my email address active so i had a like sweet talk them until it helped me get access and somehow i still kept the two off on my phone i swore i deleted it but i didn't and um so that way y'all know and i just want to give a shout out to you bedrock really quick um remote when you get a second can you go to uh this webpage because it's really dope uh can you please dm can you please private chat it to me so i can select it because oh yeah because it's yeah yeah it's free mirror it doesn't doesn't like the things doesn't like the things gonna make it like building bedrock layout you're called gonna need either a name or some kind of a thingy i'm honored to get called so our contributors file building bedrock layout it does two things um it uh it means you agree to our our kind of fairly standard um code of conduct for our text basis and things and there's a link at the top it also assigns copyright for your contributions to distribute it as like the steward of this open-source project so we don't end up in a a bootstrap situation trying to change a license or something and having to track hundreds of people uh down um gem is your are you also on the contributors file yet i thought you were so you are not you're not you're not you're not you're not you're not you're not oh i don't think i'm on the contributors side because i'm one of the main team members i don't know you guys gave me some fancy stuff uh yeah yeah let's let's get Jen on there too yeah totally totally Jen Jenod yay uh we add full stop we commit this is not i'm sorry i know it's slow but no no no it's all good uh i will i will uh check out bedrocks website in the meantime wow yeah so this is like the and we're uh bedrock we're gonna see if i can explain it because it was a stream a long time ago hold on let me just switch to english oh no i'm so sorry there we go it's okay it's totally cool um so what it is is like i was in learning uh okay hold on instead of having to do html to css you can do it the html inside of css with bedrock did i say that right
Yeah sure well and i feel like we hit that nice middle sweet spot right like um we're so inspired by the open source world and use a lot of concepts that came out of open source tech in our like this humanitarian aid space right and getting people to document knowledge publicly right kind of like like spinning up these like open offer community services and stuff um very inspired and we're dealing with two different solidarity economies there's the solidarity economy and the open source kind of tech space there's the solidarity economy and this kind of grassroots aid network space and um open source addi brings those two together right that's the code we write helps move atoms in the real world to support people in need and do that in a sustainable and reliable manner um so i think it's super cool but like john said like very beginner friendly like we're all volunteers we're just here to have a good time right it's got to be a good time for people to stick around you got learn and grow and you know support your own career and i think that's what john's going to really help us build out this year with the dev champions program is like you get to contribute code to an awesome open source project and you know get something to show your employer right and get a sweet story to tell you know your your teammates on the get that job or whatever um so yeah yeah all right that's the time to plug our donate page remote that's pretty new because we want to do i have to show where the all the new folks where the donate pages like our work open collectives so as always you can contribute to distribute a dot org slash donate we don't have to goodness your rights yeah yeah like i said everything we're trying to get it all out the door here we go see our different projects find out more info you can uh click donate it'll take you to the right place on the internet um if you like what we do please support it um we deliver a lot of aid and we are very efficient every dollar you donate delivers eighty seven dollars worth a humanitarian aid um and like i said we're a grassroots all volunteer open source team so and this is what Thursdays are about so definitely hang out with us on Thursdays the rest of the week is let's see monday is just like hanging out with Laura which is miscellaneous Mondays and we work through like this week we work through lighting and next monday we're going to be working through obs and on friday as we talk about tython and typescript every other friday so a lot mattering on the day you're just going to get surprised with some goodness but on Thursdays it's all distributed there we go cool uh my graphic when everybody joined in and i was like oh there's people um my i feel like a graphic like that will help with um the coordination oh this is a good one um do you coordinate with other non-profits that have similar goals yes great question um we don't want to become a big institution we're taking a very twenty first century kind of network building approach um to the organizing that we do um and we're trying to solve like supply chain almost as a utility layer right and offer different services that are open to these other groups right thinking of it more as like almost like an API layer right okay if you want to help people in your community can you tell someone your needs who are just like going out there after getting those donations you know can you like bring a pallet into some community storage um so i think um the whole point is to do this working with other people get more people involved in these kind of humanitarian and aid movements make it more accessible to them um and right now we work with over 150 organizations in a dozen different countries um so uh we're not going to expand to new regions for the next year but hoping to kind of double down on those relationships and you know help grow more groups help get more groups into uh into the aid movement and then onto our supply chain yeah something that uh comes to mind of especially about right before we were looking at um the design when you were going through uh Ramon you were going through the page where it was like the breakdown of um yeah i don't remember yeah yeah so something that i'm curious about and i know you we're looking at um behind the scenes a bit of how was this made um so the story for something like this um kind of follows our the usual tech development approach i'm going to get on my soapbox here just because uh do it how do we build something you know how did this come to happen it starts on the uh kind of aid worker side right we needed to solve a very practical logistics problem what do people need can we project that need can we use that to you know go after in-kind donors and tell them like you can't just approach a big company and say give me socks and underwear you can approach them and say in this region for this response you might care about i need 5,000 pairs of socks and 5,000 pairs of underwear broken down by these sizes and stuff like that so we just started asking people you know quarterly could you tell us what you need got a whole messy set of data built a structure and kind of went through google forms and then tried quadrics but didn't afford the license so we're like hey let's build our own tool and uh Marcus was the lead on that project um he uh built uh need assessment survey tool now and kind of a eight database you know backing that data and an API to provide summary results right we don't want to release individual group surveys but we'll release summaries for each sub-region um so huge shout out to him and i think that's a great example john as people go through our dev champions program right like contribute to the existing projects contribute to the landing site you know but really hoping to identify open source leaders through that program who can take on their own projects and help us build other tools um just like Marcus did so i kind of came in here i wanted to set the stage um because this is not the only data source we have we have a whole shipment data reporting kind of our impact reporting pipeline that we've been building out and getting data together for um but we need the capability on our landing site to show this data off so um i kind of went in and use this as my excuse to set up um you know that and we're using nivo graphs there's a ton of different types of graphs out there that people could do um and uh yeah like figured out the data ingestion through gatsby um and you know just kind of plugged it into one of those nivo graphs and then you know set up these controls right you people could even add more controls but i wanted to do one kind of end-to-end feature like this um myself to say like hey here's an example you can refer to in our code base you know here's an approach i'm i open the criticism i'm open like doing things different ways but at least here's a starting point right and again bringing that to what you're building out this is what lorith can for it who's like really excited to take some awesome interesting data and a great visualization library and and you know put the two together to come up with new graphs and new charts and help provide new answers with the data we already have who who wants to like get into the back end and work on you know kind of automating our data pipeline so that when we deliver 20 trucks of food to Ukraine that can get to the landing site the next day instead of three months later you know in a pdf quarterly report right um so i think uh we we can dive into more of what Ramon and i talked about last time but then we want to use the program you're building um to set up these pathways for contributors where they feel supported like we know we can support them we know there's an example there there's a like a code c map shout out to our sponsors at codesse um you know showing you where in the code base you're going to need to look for different things um and that help people develop their confidence and develop their skill set by giving them a structure way to contribute to d a over time and like building up their repertoire uh you know through that i think one of the things that excites me the most about this is about building this how to make into state access accessible is that it is built in such a way to make these shareable do you want to take us a little bit through this link field here yes so the first thing i want you to do Ramon go back to the top let's um change categories to items yes i do like like what what might uh let's group by subregion let's group by sublipin let's index by item that's it and then let's select grease maybe um from the filter and if we could change the sort to value and change the order i the i've messed up my tests in the order server so change it to uh maybe change it to ascending okay i didn't mess it up yes so so that's what i'm talking about right we have now taken a bunch of data and visualized it to create an answer that will get people needed items like basic humanitarian like what does it take to survive stuff right this is a list of the past years worth of data for grease ranking those items by the a number of needed items we can translate that to like monthly needs you know sometimes you need a lot of diapers but only a couple sets of clothes or something right so we can we can kind of combine it with other data sets and kind of continue to discover answers through it but like if someone's like what does grease need i want to support refugees there this is the graph that i send them and they take this and they produce you know a whole ton of amazing stuff right will produce you know kind of like like how many collection events do we need what should we tell people to bring to those collection events people take this to in-kind donors hey if your company has overstock here's the list of things will automatically accept right and we can also take this uh and use it for advocacy and highlight you know what is the size and scale of like the unmet humanitarian needs there um to agencies and governments that like might have the ability to do something about it or might not be interested in helping these people but we can at least tell them like this is the gap that you're leaving that our network is uh excuse me it was trying to fill really quick i just want to call out one of the comments that we just got uh it's homey and we all adore homey and you said coming up here yeah so um for those who don't know who homey is he is literally everyone's homey and is so supportive and one of the biggest reasons that i've been able to do what i do and he's been sick for a while so please everyone you know send him some love goodbye that kind of thing because homey's been sick for a while and um we miss him and thank you for saying hi go take care of yourself we will be around we will not fall off the edge of the world and as you get better you hit that point of lockdown where it's more boredom than sickness let me know i'm like working on all this code stuff so if you just want to chill on zoom as i code hit me up on me um but yeah no for real y'all the new covid variant like as aid workers where where covid responsible and and it's uh it's not good man uh the new one is is not good so now's the time if you're in a cab or a uber or on a bus or you know whatever like mask up when you can get the uh get the booster the bi-anvil booster um if anyone wants 200,000 masks i got them in a warehouse in Germany and i can probably ship them new for free so uh if you know what to do with that you but uh seriously like take care of yourselves right the world needs us uh happy and healthy uh so that we can uh take care of each other but homey better all the best yes yes and thank you please continue i just really want to take that opportunity yeah anyways point meing like so we have this needs assessment tool we have the data groups have been participating this empowers the people that fill up this survey to take action to send the city of supporters and remonia exactly right that link right there and codes all those filters into the url so that if you copy and paste it like if you share it on facebook whatever um you know it'll take people back to the graph you were viewing that didn't work because probably something i did with maybe it's just like difficult with gidpod to get that to work i'm not sure yeah eight thousand gidpod or ios slash we can start with the the netlify branch preview we tried out there yeah sounds good i don't wonder what happened though oh no wait ah that'll do it you'll find out that'll do it come back gidpod oh yeah that's my bad uh yeah we got a comment here i'm not sure how to share him but building bedrock says i can irresponsibly use 200 masks um but they should use for out there intended so these are cloth masks unfortunately we're having a hard time placing them so they really are just up for grabs but the minimum order size for them is going to probably be a full 40 foot container i can't break them down smaller that maybe a pallet of like 10,000 at a time it's kind of the scale that we we operate at yeah fair um so somebody has to have a garage or something to put it somewhere um because i'm gonna say i want you to probably have a warehouse that a truck can back up to is is the real answer there i was just gonna say it's not gonna fit through your front door no no that's actually a big part of our us strategy right now though is we've just started a hubs working group we have four different cities where people are setting up their own eight wires out in hubs as we've been like talking to them for a few months about this so really excited and and that's kind of the point of what we do we do a lot of this bundling to help these like really grassroots community driven groups work together to interact with the big complicated global supply chain in an economically efficient manner right so if you do just have a garage you need to call your local hub who has that warehouse that we can back a truck out to and you can reserve your pallet off of it if you have a small community distrell if you want to stock up you know to take care of your employees like whatever it is right um you know that's kind of our strategy how do we break this like very large scale aid stuff down into something that you as an individual or group of friends or a community or ten to manage the our work you're on everything's working again so now i took the link there we go my new tab put it in and there we go so an item grease and these are resherable and like i like that the colors are randomized by the way thanks yeah i've been kind of like trying to just get like basic designs up so yeah on the background of different things like the background changes and i just kind of took um you know the lighter swaths of our color scheme and have like a little background color randomizer bar chart color randomizer so that i didn't have to make decisions i'm just like a designer made this decision on what the colors are and it'll be a designer randomly and i'll be okay with that and i can be one loving loving cool um so we got we got some time left and i don't want to miss out i don't want to deprive us of like planning this uh or show like talking about this this contributor program i did get excited about Jen's idea of having the arrows next to the title Jen what do you think do you want to try and put this in uh you can drive we give you pretty things i mean you you can do it i just want to make the pretty things i say that but i mean i do but i honestly just look i don't i don't know why don't you drive and Jen can navigate like i'm like what should do and i can navigate on the like where does this live in the code is cool okay okay we do that we get a contribution by the way i learned how to do like a co-authored commits so you will get a green square i always feel bad when i rebase other people's work and it adds to me as i call up here and i'm like no i just rebased it it's okay that said rebasing is work that's true it is like that's an event container thing okay so we are looking at i'm excited um really quick i just want to like it's finished through as um the process is so that graphic already exists somewhere so would it be i would well remote-striving but like the process would be going and finding that graphic and then adding it on each side of the text or would it have to be well i was wondering does it have to be like an upload to an icon um to be able to use that way so the way i would find this out oh sorry no no i love it i i want to be able to discover it actually i'm i'm true like Jen you and i have zero like inside into this so this is like you and me discovering i love this so the way i would find out if this is like an icon from like an icon pack or something is i would inspect this element using my browser and if you see here that span class relative and there you see there's the icon so it is an html character yes that's so much easier to do right so we can take it no no direct me direct me you're the boss here well um because we would have to do it for every page though um maybe how would you do it for each of the the um it depends on how it's coded up and so the question is did i handcraft all of those different pages or is there like a template or something there where you just have to change it one spot um i my thought process is you would have done a template or what bedrock said of a component because back in the day you were trying to we were trying to do templates of something and i fell off the edge of the earth uh no you didn't so uh i would go to the code what did you call that get pod yeah get pod and i don't know if i would search or oh see i would not be the actual unit code thing right in the code it's going to be the html kind of like and whatever whatever call and oh see i would actually go through the folder structure okay because i would want to know how it's linked together um folks by the way start interrupt to gen uh as always let us know if the fun size is too small um all we gotta all you gotta do is let us know we'll make it bigger carry on gen can i make a recommendation here real quick um on the get hub pr we got the code see review maps integrated so that'll show you which files i've changed right and you can use that rather than like exploring the whole code based structure like what's a reasonable place for this thing to live right can we can we shortcut our way to to where this is good call so our sponsors uh kotees is kindly sponsoring our uh our street our our streams and our further development so they here we can get a like a visualization of which files have changed yeah and this always makes me confused because i'm still lurking working on learning like the um how to go look for stuff yeah i'm always like visualization now why but i'm normally such a visual person that this would be really helpful yeah and this is like such a large PR that it's like maybe less helpful than the usual like kind of smaller modular PRs that we do because this is integrating a lot of stuff but i think we can i think we can work our way because like building bedrock layouts is very correctly start with pages and work your way down yeah so we've got our pages here for the regions and each so we were looking at a sub region page so if we take a look here we can see which ones are being what is being used here block links list section grid gasp image i'm just gonna like poke around and see what i find and having to look um oh so it does actually give full i always thought it just gave like what the file was not that it um if you double click on it it'll it'll show you the code diff yeah i'm just gonna use all the time like if i'm reviewing someone's PR i don't usually get hub interface i go straight to kotec i kind of use the visualization to build my mental model and then step through the review looking at like the line by line diff file by file does it it it's not just like here's a bunch of files you got to sort through it's like oh i can start just like bedrock said like when we start with the page then we'll get the component the page uses and kind of mark them off as i go so then we would take the one thousand yeah and then we would put that on either side of the class yeah that yeah you read my mind so we got to go to d a sub region dot slug so it won't you change it there you can only infuse it there yeah more like the the review interface if you want to change those you gotta you know have it in your editor have it on get pod or something like that can it open from kotec to get pod for the accurate so you don't have to go search for the file again no but that's gonna be our streams uh once a week feature a class kotec team if you're watching this i want to be able to click on a get pod button right here so you open the PR and yeah that'd be really cool i get i get we will give random feedback yeah so what's the eric simons company is doing something cool that that kind of does that it'll put it in get hub so it'll like add a comment just like kote adds the comment with the map it'll add a comment to a dev environment so you can just like click the button and kind of check out the pr and it's like up and running um let me see if i can find it real quick i don't know that but that sounds really helpful and yeah i know i thought it seemed like a pod but it actually gets that level of granularity um so you'll get to the code stuff and let me see if i can't come up with uh yeah totally uh okay gen so i've done what you instructed but it looks cannot read properties of null reading remove child i probably just have to refresh a okay well okay we did take a mic and put on you there's so yeah but hey we're on the right track that that's a win a win is a win um 95 this looks like the right one what do you think yes um well can we copy and paste it into the google to verify oh that's a good call let's see that downward two headed arrow that's the one yay that way because i would end up doing it where it would end up like fixing it every time and then getting really annoyed and going oh wait yeah the other thing you did that i noticed is that you centered it oh i did center it yes which i'm not as concerned about the centering um as much as just making sure that they were on both sides and i didn't have room um with the way it previously was so i ended up just centering it because of that but centering it may look better you're right exactly so um we can give it a try let me what about spacing issues building better archaea says what about spacing should it be bigger the title or the icons because i personally like the icons the only thing that i think we should change here is in the menu um itself by regions it's putting a space between all regions in the arrow oh each region and its respective arrow yeah because uh it's it's bugging me i don't have a i feel like this is going to be like me trying to explain things so it's like i don't know what's just bugging me that's not a really good reason why probably be here right Taylor that would probably be here for each other between the oh in between the icons and heading yeah yeah the other thing you could do is you could move the span there outside and put it in the um in the kind of parent flexbox so that it has the same gap between the arrow as the as the text um so you do it either way okay well that the the prettier we'll do its thing yeah yeah you need this to probably not know i was probably just putting a div in there to have a div in there i can have it on the other one so clearly there's some copy and patient and against going on yeah that looks space here i do you like the space here can we make the menu one icon bigger this one yeah hard to select yes let's see that i'm not showing up in your browser among but you see that top negative top negative four i was trying to have that arrow intersect with the the hr there so that it would like becoming down but be attached to that kind of horizontal line so make it think like create that effect i don't know if that effect is helpful it is it is a helpful effect i think this is going to be tricky to achieve across different operating systems and browsers yeah it seems like a very hacky solution so i'm with you i'm with you i'm with you i think i think there's something i don't know yeah i do i do dig me a good hacky solution um but yeah let's let's uh text for excel all right let's make the six x out too big but hey do five did no five oh i like that and then can we center full of all of you please yes yeah and then we'll have to do the same for the region one oh yeah the region page yeah it's kind of like you know do things twice and kind of refine them and then make it modular so i think these region and sub-region pages have a lot of overlap which i need to refactor out into components oh i i i'm the same i'm the same tailor uh or to the audience if you're excited about coding at this year's date you could refactor them out to the uh the components too absolutely i need to figure out how to do tech center in tailwind unless somebody knows i'm not sure it's a tech center thing it might be a flex box thing right because i'm using like stacks of flex boxes so it might be yeah i don't know if that if that HR or if the heading goes all the way across or if it gets kind of scaled down and to make it left aligned yeah good call because it fill out i need to get out of mobile view there we go yeah see it doesn't go all the way yeah yeah to get that HR effect there um i have that 20% larger you see that with six slash fifths so i kind of potentially was having it stick out the end what you could do is maybe like you know not have it do that or something um but then it might cut off too close to the arrows you could also have left padding to the title and the subtitle to kind of like you know do like yeah you could do some publishing stuff i just committed to cry my think oh i love it oh yay oh so easy see this is what happens when you get a lazy developer on stream so if we do the same size etc done listen if we're gonna use a hack we might as well use it again yeah yeah that works yeah that's consistency right there we i'm see after my own a hardtailer exactly consistency um cool let's so i think that's i think that's established as working um what we can do now is just take this change and move it over to the other region page and then do all of that commit it and then um take a look at the the program some good yeah it sounds that sounds great Jen you good without too yeah fabulous so that's um um is this page public right now it um it's publicly available in some form like like if you go to distributed dot org slash regions it's there all the data and everything is on it publicly but we haven't launched the page yet so it's not on our like production like you want to regions or needs on our production yeah this is this is to get it up there and have the menu items be accessible on stuff so perfect that is what i needed to know yeah what am i doing here this is the arrow we wanted to make this text five excel and we've got the bigger than that need to be spaced out at the dove i think um other direction there you want that one to go above right so you want to move it outside that class flex there you go and you can just get rid of the extremist div oh yeah big fan of deleting divs thanks yes yeah went through so many like different iterations on the style that i just had like extra elements lying around those like pop in tasting on Jen and chat thoughts what what do you think this is the region page now based on your new and improved design um i like it now i have something else i don't like what's that that's what we're doing this for the and the ampersand yeah i think that's an easy fix right yeah um uh Oxford comma step oh Oxford comma separator is that something you made i read a little utility yet i love it so we could have a strict comma separator or something if you go to um source slash itils i think there's a one function string itels file there i mean that's what that's what holding command and clicking on it is for it takes us here i use sublime text still okay i'm old school i listen i'm still using vim i don't have much of an argument i don't have a foot to stand on here um so i think what we can do right is just take this yes your own call it strict comma separator or just comma separator whatever yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah get comma separator and uh well building better okay i have vscode all the way i will not argue with you vscode is extremely cool a tool um i don't think oh i see we just take out that uh if else clause right if we just remove that uh right not not the first one um okay no yeah and both of them both of them yeah you're right yeah there we go there you go gen i think i think get comma separator then we need to fix the import and if i could spell correctly it wouldn't be all my separator but comma there we go there we go what do you think i like it excellent as you play again stop and point with the uh the code stuff if we got those yes let's see get hub co author it's a little bit wordy but we can do it okay so back here uh get status we will do my favorite patching so we've replaced the comma separator and we've done our spacing yeah and of course we added it status okay that's all those are all the changes next yeah um the type script check script failing so i added them to our pre commit hook uh to to point out because like they're they're pretty invisible to me yeah using sublime text and now you got tired of like pushing commits with a simple type script like issue and then having the depth like uh the cicd shut me down so this is a fix uh tweak region and so we can yeah everything okay let's do it look building bedrock layout give us your give us your your it's uh we can do that but then we got to add building bedrock uh to the contributors yeah totally you should you should um so hold up we need first we need is your github username jen jennad yes it took a lot but yes it is why did you take a lot um because it was under it was when i first started in the tech world and it was under a work email address and luckily they still have my email address active so i had a like sweet talk them until it helped me get access and somehow i still kept the two off on my phone i swore i deleted it but i didn't and um so that way y'all know and i just want to give a shout out to you bedrock really quick um remote when you get a second can you go to uh this webpage because it's really dope uh can you please dm can you please private chat it to me so i can select it because oh yeah because it's yeah yeah it's free mirror it doesn't doesn't like the things doesn't like the things gonna make it like building bedrock layout you're called gonna need either a name or some kind of a thingy i'm honored to get called so our contributors file building bedrock layout it does two things um it uh it means you agree to our our kind of fairly standard um code of conduct for our text basis and things and there's a link at the top it also assigns copyright for your contributions to distribute it as like the steward of this open-source project so we don't end up in a a bootstrap situation trying to change a license or something and having to track hundreds of people uh down um gem is your are you also on the contributors file yet i thought you were so you are not you're not you're not you're not you're not you're not you're not oh i don't think i'm on the contributors side because i'm one of the main team members i don't know you guys gave me some fancy stuff uh yeah yeah let's let's get Jen on there too yeah totally totally Jen Jenod yay uh we add full stop we commit this is not i'm sorry i know it's slow but no no no it's all good uh i will i will uh check out bedrocks website in the meantime wow yeah so this is like the and we're uh bedrock we're gonna see if i can explain it because it was a stream a long time ago hold on let me just switch to english oh no i'm so sorry there we go it's okay it's totally cool um so what it is is like i was in learning uh okay hold on instead of having to do html to css you can do it the html inside of css with bedrock did i say that right Travis maybe maybe something close it was really cool when you showed it to me i'm not always that that's kind of cool though like can we dive into uh it's really cool oh i should go grab that uh stream it's both the streamwork and a react component library uh meet why i swear i've heard of this before yeah how how news is project uh bedrock because i feel like i've got a friend who like brings up a css framework all the like new same with css framework all the time and i feel like he's mentioned it to me or maybe you've mentioned it Jen um considering i didn't uh say it very well maybe i did but um here's the youtube video of when um we streamed and just looking back at it it looks oh my goodness that was in August yeah time flies yeah it's been that long oh my goodness i don't even i don't even know i don't know where time went i thought it was like a month ago so that's done um you can do it right thanks for the contributions everybody did push oh so sorry bedrock when we bring it up oh dude this put on the left hand so you can see what it does how what it does yeah oh you've got examples oh oh oh oh neat so you're like interesting so you're like declaring your layout as your uh markup very cool nice super cool very cool giving me bringing me back to my bootstrap days love it love it thank you so much for building and sharing this avatars nice i know people that do cool things yeah for real love it yeah you sure you share it that would work really well with um tina cms so we're kind of going through like uh um content management system upgrade in February um and uh forestry is being depreciated but the the new product that team is building is called tina um and i think we can unlock like live editor preview so like if people are adding to or editing you know like let's say you're a logistic coordinator updating one of those region pages with new information right you can see that like as you're typing it out in the editor instead of having like submit your changes and wait for prod to rebuild and so um bedrock nida it seems like like given the kind of plug-in play nature of of what you're building out here with these you know style components right um like uh for that avatar or something like having tina cms hooks into it would provide like a really cool end-to-end dev experience where you get the content like creation side through that and get based cms i just wanted to like connect those two ideas yeah yeah i should check them out super cool cool i realized we're running low on time i do want to finally um give us a chance to talk about you know our big projects not that this is mel i have a small problem but i feel like something that would help um you definitely did not hijack the stream you did not know yeah no like i was bringing them um so something that i'm i'm curious about on codz is have you ever used the tool mero like a mero board yes well i mean i've heard of it i haven't used it i'm wondering if codz has any tool like that so we wouldn't have to add a tool to our tech staff so like uh like the ability to draw our visualizations yeah like a brainstorming board or because i know i know this has been requested like full disclosure i used to work at codz i think there were either there were there there were discussions and definitely requests like i'm not i'm not gonna say definitively whether they were planning on working on it or not but like being able to draft out maps collaboratively is something that has been requested okay why it's a kind of life i think if you want i like that's interesting yeah so so codz is like you can just get a code based map and you can like comment on it and you can label different files and things like yeah you can set up tours if you want or you like walk people through but that sounds different than what you're talking about gem yeah for like planning a future uh like new files new organization methods i said i think uh this is something that has been requested okay then what i would suggest we do because i do want to go into the planning aspect of it but i personally think um just getting in my head the tech stack so that way i don't have to like do stuff and then try to remember to move the stuff to what we decide to do because uh to be on a self-forget and if i write it down i will write it down and then i may forget to put it on the other thing um just because i think that would be really good for the visualization and also with next steps yeah do does distribute aids so far use any um can be on boards or anything like notion or your table yeah so we we have a notion and i can get that i can get you access to that gem and we can probably set up a space on there um you know if we want to kind of open that up to like the dadev community right we can have like a subsection we i mean for stuff like that like um and same thing with our slack it's like a little bit in the bubble because we have a lot of operational details there and so like we just need to like create structured access right like forward okay here's like the tech space and that's safe for everyone like working on tech projects and you know some of the aid stuff for like where like like like yeah we deliver aid to safe houses sometimes like yeah that would not everyone needs needs that address right exactly exactly i'm just thinking that would be a little easier to at least get something started from and knowing where that's gonna go to be able to build upon um so if I could get that but and i i'm waiting i'm purposely waiting to ask about more details in the vision um until those are set up because i i use mirror a lot in the fact of it's very visual for me i can be like okay cool like you're saying that this is the core thing we need to do i can do a squiggly line over here at that point to some other thing uh and i think that would be cool to show case and something that i think would be really cool for us since we were starting to do these Thursdays is you know just choosing what we're gonna do on the Thursday i love that you guys were doing the code stuff today because i was like cool i could do other stuff and hang out and still contribute but yeah you know it wasn't using full mental effort i guess is a good way of saying it um i don't know if that makes any sense to the job oh totally it's easy to like pick up and play right and like don't think and then make a contribution and yeah no i thought today was a really good stream but i hear you um let me um i probably and i'll reach out after this stream but we need to do some like DA volunteer onboarding stuff and get you access to some of the existing tools and spaces and then if you want to use additional tools that's very easy the only like you can use the tools you need to do to to run this project um and if it costs money just check in with me so i can see if there's like a grant or something we we usually try to reach out to people and get like a free account or you know like a free kind of paid you know whatever the paid plan is um because of the work that we do um so i want to kind of go through the the process for that um but yeah you know like this is exactly why i'm excited to work with you it's like you know these tools you you you know like like have this kind of like already like you know what to do so i want to want to be supported of that direction you want to take it in and yay and more perspectives are better yep yes and i'm excited for this and i personally think that it's cool to see everything that we did today and something that i love about open source and um bedrock has done this before too uh especially when i was such a new of you don't have to be a coder to contribute to open source like everything i did today was talking about i want to make things pretty like this is a design thing that is bugging shit out of me uh and this is stuff that you know you can learning how to use get hub you can create these type of um you know issues or submit for these it's something that i first did with when i was really scared of it i did with bedrock and it's it makes it so much more accessible to those who don't want to learn how to code it's just learning the tools so i'm really excited to show this may i be a little bit cheeky and plug a talk i've given last year please oh yeah only only if you link it of course i'm gonna link it how are people watching otherwise so at codeline last year i gave a talk titled there's more to open source than code and it is exactly about not only what my journey into open source was like which was not by coding because i was terrified of making code contributions because i was like what if i make a giant PR and i discovered that someone's already made it or what if i try and claim an issue and someone's like hey you can't do that so my approach was to start talking to people like you like like you are just talking to people and being like hey what are we all doing how can i help here's some insights from me and so on and so forth it is terrifying i will say that because i think everybody's gonna be really mean um i'm just gonna best it out then they're gonna make it for me oh that was some pretty colors um but yeah is everybody's normally really kind and we'll show you how to do it and you you need practice it'll take a few times not something that magically happens it doesn't it's what i love about what we're doing here right i feel like um i like a couple of people i've talked to about like the DA you know like our contributors would just catch up at a code jam or something and i think that we facilitate like a really safe and positive and encouraging space right because we're just like happy to move the aid and like whoever wants to contribute to the thing we're doing is welcome um but i hear you on that structure side Jan like people do need time but you you have to start off somewhere and so you know like giving people a structured pathway through that kind of early stage open source journey i'm excited to build that out with you um and then also specifically recognizing what you're saying about non-code contributors i know remote talks about this affair bit on stream and a large part of what we do is like we're building tech to enable non-tech contributors right like all of the data is gathered by logistics coordinators all the contents read by our admins right um you know and so i if you part of the point of contributing technically is you know to to enable those folks to contribute non-technically but there's definitely you know this this kind of maintainer side or you know testing side there's so many different tracks you can go down you know that's um like a very valid brand necessary contribution so excited to set those tracks up through our our dev champions program as well and you know i think and i and i think by just like poking around and testing around that this is something we try to do very very much with distribute aid is emphasize that we are here to help you and this is something that and i'm just gonna i know we didn't get to do it today and i apologize um this is something we we the exact kind of thing that we want to enable with distribute aid which is this is something we started drafting with Taylor and this is something that we want Jen well that Jen is going to very kindly help us with by taking taking lead on the contributor program building out one thing one thing that i've been seeing i don't want to get on too much of a soapbox here myself but one thing that i've been seeing over the last box i'll try i'll try i'll try to be gentle um one thing that i've been seeing a lot in the last year or so of being very online trademark is that a lot of people want to get an open source but that onboarding point is tricky and finding a project is tricky and finding a project that that that because at the same time maintainers are human beings maintainers have lives they need to cater to maintainers can only do good open source if they are able to do it both health wise resource wise so you know leaning on maintainers to do all of the light work of that main to maintainership is difficult so what can we do as maintainers best in order to you know have more maintainers have fellow contributors and all of that is to make that on ramping easier and this is exactly what we're aiming with with the just distribute aid program did you say aid but that's not working title by the way that we're open to change here i think there's even an issue like our discussion about it but the working title is actually for people developers a little bit at you know like uh it's um yeah i've mentioned it to people and it's it's a little bit of a problem i'm gonna noodle on it i'm gonna noodle on it okay i mean one of the most classic paradigms of programming is um what is it the hardest things in programming are naming and what else uh regax probably regular expressions i like regular expressions but i understand that but yes yeah there's also a GitHub discussion and this is a thing like i can't think of many open source champion programs like champions that are built in public this is why i'm so excited about this and this is why i invite all of you i'm just throwing links into the chat there's a discussion yeah really to everyone watching right now like like we're building this for y'all like i'm trying to you know like like the point of this is like what what would make it exciting and interesting and supported to contribute you know to open source projects and specifically you know distribute aids open source projects but by building it in public right like it's a a great way for us just like our our different you know like trucking and other sort of resource guides like anyone can pick this up and apply them to their open source stuff right and make it easier to get people involved there right and give people you know structure give them validation you know let them use this as a stepping stone in their own career journey right like uh yeah exactly so there's a discussion come in contribute we want to hear from y'all like what can we do and this is because what we ultimately want to do is have some kind of for lack of a better term brand recognition that you can bring in that you can bring in to say when you're looking for your first tech role that you can say hey and again name is not final i'm a distribute aid what can i bring like and and have that sort of be like oh wow this is somebody who's just like people and and you saw here previously sorry i know i'm taking us a little bit over time i don't want to keep everybody i love i love how you're excited you are there and i'm glad you're like let's give it up it's up to me fired up this stuff gets me real fired up because like this is an opportunity for us as a community to build up our again for lack of a better term prestige no and i feel you like on this open box you know i think it's it's a very common and like kind of problematic like the the randomness of like which open source projects will take off but it's like okay like like you know when it does there's tons of people that contribute to all these like big open source projects but it's usually like the team that was at you know Facebook that started react right those are the people that get the recognition you know those are the people's whose career trajectories get changed i'm like but wait a minute like we're all like contributing to react in different ways and writing documentation and you know teaching courses i know there's a lot of like um like coding bootcamp stuff from on and so i think by you know trying to develop some structure but but have a thing right have a thing that you can talk about that hopefully people like like like you said they're like oh you went through this program i know what that means you know that's a way where it's not just like the Taylor show or the remote show or the gen show like oh we did tech ideas like no i went through the program i made my contributions i help get that aid moved right and like like take that to people like get your get your worth out of your open source contributions you know at the risk of sounding corny this you know people are sorry people power open source why not use open source to empower people i love it i love it that's our timeline right there i'm a big i'm a big cheeseball and i don't i don't deny it it's fine yeah folks we've had you on for so long i'm so thankful and i'm so sorry to take us over time gen thank you so much for joining us and for you know being here to kick off 2023 with us i'm so excited um i think what we're building here not only the website but also this contributor ship program um it's just gonna be huge um and and i yeah i think this is gonna bring great things yeah well hope on that note hold on i got i got a raid to somebody let's oh yeah let's do the raid i don't do this any like i've never done this so like i don't understand so what we're gonna what's gonna happen now Taylor in case you're curious is gen is gonna find somebody who's streaming and send all of our viewers all the way to them that's why Jason's ended up coming over here is he got many of those streaming um and he's a rock star so but i need to actually find somebody that's streaming that's not the three of us that i thought it'll show you yeah don't know this person but uh bedrock says this person's available oh okay thank you yay why am i not following you follow okay and straight right right right right i need are you doing hurry are we doing the raid yeah it's uh you have to do it from twitch you can't do it from okay which is really annoying in case anybody was curious it's not not an easy process but they're getting rated now i'm bye bye everybody
Travis maybe maybe something close it was really cool when you showed it to me i'm not always that that's kind of cool though like can we dive into uh it's really cool oh i should go grab that uh stream it's both the streamwork and a react component library uh meet why i swear i've heard of this before yeah how how news is project uh bedrock because i feel like i've got a friend who like brings up a css framework all the like new same with css framework all the time and i feel like he's mentioned it to me or maybe you've mentioned it Jen um considering i didn't uh say it very well maybe i did but um here's the youtube video of when um we streamed and just looking back at it it looks oh my goodness that was in August yeah time flies yeah it's been that long oh my goodness i don't even i don't even know i don't know where time went i thought it was like a month ago so that's done um you can do it right thanks for the contributions everybody did push oh so sorry bedrock when we bring it up oh dude this put on the left hand so you can see what it does how what it does yeah oh you've got examples oh oh oh oh neat so you're like interesting so you're like declaring your

we try to do very very much with distribute aid is emphasize that we are here to help you and this is something that and i'm just gonna i know we didn't get to do it today and i apologize um this is something we we the exact kind of thing that we want to enable with distribute aid which is this is something we started drafting with Taylor and this is something that we want Jen well that Jen is going to very kindly help us with by taking taking lead on the contributor program building out one thing one thing that i've been seeing i don't want to get on too much of a soapbox here myself but one thing that i've been seeing over the last box i'll try i'll try i'll try to be gentle um one thing that i've been seeing a lot in the last year or so of being very online trademark is that a lot of people want to get an open source but that onboarding point is tricky and finding a project is tricky and finding a project that that that because at the same time maintainers are human beings maintainers have lives they need to cater to maintainers can only do good open source if they are able to do it both health wise resource wise so you know leaning on maintainers to do all of the light work of that main to maintainership is difficult so what can we do as maintainers best in order to you know have more maintainers have fellow contributors and all of that is to make that on ramping easier and this is exactly what we're aiming with with the just distribute aid program did you say aid but that's not working title by the way that we're open to change here i think there's even an issue like our discussion about it but the working title is actually for people developers a little bit at you know like uh it's um yeah i've mentioned it to people and it's it's a little bit of a problem i'm gonna noodle on it i'm gonna noodle on it okay i mean one of the most classic paradigms of programming is um what is it the hardest things in programming are naming and what else uh regax probably regular expressions i like regular expressions but i understand that but yes yeah there's also a GitHub discussion and this is a thing like i can't think of many open source champion programs like champions that are built in public this is why i'm so excited about this and this is why i invite all of you i'm just throwing links into the chat there's a discussion yeah really to everyone watching right now like like we're building this for y'all like i'm trying to you know like like the point of this is like what what would make it exciting and interesting and supported to contribute you know to open source projects and specifically you know distribute aids open source projects but by building it in public right like it's a a great way for us just like our our different you know like trucking and other sort of resource guides like anyone can pick this up and apply them to their open source stuff right and make it easier to get people involved there right and give people you know structure give them validation you know let them use this as a stepping stone in their own career journey right like uh yeah exactly so there's a discussion come in contribute we want to hear from y'all like what can we do and this is because what we ultimately want to do is have some kind of for lack of a better term brand recognition that you can bring in that you can bring in to say when you're looking for your first tech role that you can say hey and again name is not final i'm a distribute aid what can i bring like and and have that sort of be like oh wow this is somebody who's just like people and and you saw here previously sorry i know i'm taking us a little bit over time i don't want to keep everybody i love i love how you're excited you are there and i'm glad you're like let's give it up it's up to me fired up this stuff gets me real fired up because like this is an opportunity for us as a community to build up our again for lack of a better term prestige no and i feel you like on this open box you know i think it's it's a very common and like kind of problematic like the the randomness of like which open source projects will take off but it's like okay like like you know when it does there's tons of people that contribute to all these like big open source projects but it's usually like the team that was at you know Facebook that started react right those are the people that get the recognition you know those are the people's whose career trajectories get changed i'm like but wait a minute like we're all like contributing to react in different ways and writing documentation and you know teaching courses i know there's a lot of like um like coding bootcamp stuff from on and so i think by you know trying to develop some structure but but have a thing right have a thing that you can talk about that hopefully people like like like you said they're like oh you went through this program i know what that means you know that's a way where it's not just like the Taylor show or the remote show or the gen show like oh we did tech ideas like no i went through the program i made my contributions i help get that aid moved right and like like take that to people like get your get your worth out of your open source contributions you know at the risk of sounding corny this you know people are sorry people power open source why not use open source to empower people i love it i love it that's our timeline right there i'm a big i'm a big cheeseball and i don't i don't deny it it's fine yeah folks we've had you on for so long i'm so thankful and i'm so sorry to take us over time gen thank you so much for joining us and for you know being here to kick off 2023 with us i'm so excited um i think what we're building here not only the website but also this contributor ship program um it's just gonna be huge um and and i yeah i think this is gonna bring great things yeah well hope on that note hold on i got i got a raid to somebody let's oh yeah let's do the raid i don't do this any like i've never done this so like i don't understand so what we're gonna what's gonna happen now Taylor in case you're curious is gen is gonna find somebody who's streaming and send all of our viewers all the way to them that's why Jason's ended up coming over here is he got many of those streaming um and he's a rock star so but i need to actually find somebody that's streaming that's not the three of us that i thought it'll show you yeah don't know this person but uh bedrock says this person's available oh okay thank you yay why am i not following you follow okay and straight right right right right i need are you doing hurry are we doing the raid yeah it's uh you have to do it from twitch you can't do it from okay which is really annoying in case
