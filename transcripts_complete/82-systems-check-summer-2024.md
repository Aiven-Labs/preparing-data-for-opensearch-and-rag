Like the stuff that I do with the Python software foundation and the Python community Like one of the things that I'm kind of known for in some ways is doing these like impromptu interviews with people. So I I'm glad that there are opportunities to do that outside of podcasting. But it is still nice to bring it back to where it all started
Like one of the things that I'm kind of known for in some ways is doing these like impromptu interviews with people. So I I'm glad that there are opportunities to do that outside of podcasting.

That's a lot for those that don't know that's probably more than there should be. Some of these should disappear I think that might actually be my connection for the next one is to get for to officially say like, all right, you shouldn't be you shouldn't be using these. But I did, I did the thing. I did a lot of active development on one of my personal projects. It was super fun

You can also do those same things with your, the things that you have on your screen. So I was able to create this very nice orange cool background that matches the branding of the company that I work for Ivan I was able to match that color scheme for these streams that I do where I'm often working on work tasks, which really starts to tie in the look and feel in the overall brand of what I'm trying to do as I'm streaming. And if I would need to make a change, it's still super easy
I was able to match that color scheme for these streams that I do where I'm often working on work tasks, which really starts to tie in the look and feel in the overall brand of what I'm trying to do as I'm streaming.

com slash conduit with the code conduit. Go there now. Check it out our thanks to ecam for their support of the show and all of relay. Hey, Jay. It's systems check time systems check. All right. So I think last time you described what systems checks was. And so I think that's my turn. Okay. Sure Okay. Sure. So every quarter we like to do a systems check because in our normal day to day show we don't really talk about specifics for how we get things down
Okay. Sure. So every quarter we like to do a systems check because in our normal day to day show we don't really talk about specifics for how we get things down We don't really talk about the tools that we use or a lot of the actual apps and and processes or why because that's not what this show is about. The show is about supporting you and what's going on and how do you can get things done. But we're still productivity nerds
We don't really talk about the tools that we use or a lot of the actual apps and and processes or why because that's not what this show is about. The show is about supporting you and what's going on and how do you can get things done. But we're still productivity nerds That's why we started the show. And we want to talk about it occasionally. So we basically give ourselves permission once a quarter to come in and kind of update, especially with the idea that it's okay. That stuff changes
That's why we started the show. And we want to talk about it occasionally. So we basically give ourselves permission once a quarter to come in and kind of update, especially with the idea that it's okay. That stuff changes That stuff changes. Like it's fine that your system is in flux and adjusting to the way that your life works. Because it's it's constantly moving and adjusting and whatnot. And so that is what this is. This is our quarterly check in check up. Check out check over. Check in check under
That stuff changes. Like it's fine that your system is in flux and adjusting to the way that your life works. Because it's it's constantly moving and adjusting and whatnot. And so that is what this is. This is our quarterly check in check up. Check out check over. Check in check under Yeah, to kind of talk about the specifics of what tools we use to get the things done that we need to get done. So Jay, you're you're you're filling out your notes. Love that for us. What you get. So I am I'm going to get nerdy
Yeah, to kind of talk about the specifics of what tools we use to get the things done that we need to get done. So Jay, you're you're you're filling out your notes. Love that for us. What you get. So I am I'm going to get nerdy It's funny because on the episode after I have probably the nerdiest nerd that I know on the show
It's funny because on the episode after I have probably the nerdiest nerd that I know on the show I I hinted a little bit about this during the pre show of that episode that I was starting to try to get away from some of the tools that I've been using in my like not day to day, but just kind of my default tools. And what happened was really interesting. So in this in this time, I'm a developer
I I hinted a little bit about this during the pre show of that episode that I was starting to try to get away from some of the tools that I've been using in my like not day to day, but just kind of my default tools. And what happened was really interesting. So in this in this time, I'm a developer One of the most popular tools that developers use nowadays is visual studio code or VS code for short. When I worked in Microsoft, it was my job to use VS code and talk about VS code all the time
One of the most popular tools that developers use nowadays is visual studio code or VS code for short. When I worked in Microsoft, it was my job to use VS code and talk about VS code all the time So there was a lot of muscle memory that was developed just because using the thing because I had to use the thing. It didn't meant that it didn't mean that I was proficient with it. It didn't mean that it was the best tool for the job
So there was a lot of muscle memory that was developed just because using the thing because I had to use the thing. It didn't meant that it didn't mean that I was proficient with it. It didn't mean that it was the best tool for the job And I had played around with the idea of switching to a different editor for some time. And I finally just kind of made the commitment by completely changing my developer workflow
And I had played around with the idea of switching to a different editor for some time. And I finally just kind of made the commitment by completely changing my developer workflow And instead of using VS code and all of the tools that are in VS code, I decided to change my terminal from I term to a laquerity. And I'm not going to bore you with the reasons why I change from one to the other
And instead of using VS code and all of the tools that are in VS code, I decided to change my terminal from I term to a laquerity. And I'm not going to bore you with the reasons why I change from one to the other We will just say that the ease of configuration of a laquerie made it kind of nicer than what I was using before. And then because of that, a lot of the features that I got used to were now gone. And I knew that this would happen
We will just say that the ease of configuration of a laquerie made it kind of nicer than what I was using before. And then because of that, a lot of the features that I got used to were now gone. And I knew that this would happen I knew that it would make me start to rethink, well, how do I do this now? How do I do that? Now, how do I do these things now? And what that turned into was basically a renaissance of falling in love with the command line all over again
I knew that it would make me start to rethink, well, how do I do this now? How do I do that? Now, how do I do these things now? And what that turned into was basically a renaissance of falling in love with the command line all over again And going back to some tools that I hadn't used in a long time, some of them are breadstools. Shout out to Brett for those who didn't listen to the after show. And if you are not a super conductor, this might be the thing that would entice you to be a super conductor
And going back to some tools that I hadn't used in a long time, some of them are breadstools. Shout out to Brett for those who didn't listen to the after show. And if you are not a super conductor, this might be the thing that would entice you to be a super conductor Our after show, we went through every single project that Brett Terpstra has that like is actively supporting. So there's a lot. There's a lot. And the post show was as long as the actual show. And Brett broke down how each of those projects works, kind of what were some of the ideas behind them
Our after show, we went through every single project that Brett Terpstra has that like is actively supporting. So there's a lot. There's a lot. And the post show was as long as the actual show. And Brett broke down how each of those projects works, kind of what were some of the ideas behind them It was, it was amazing. But it also gave me insight into how I could use them. In fact, there were a couple of times where I was like, it would be really cool if you could do this. And Brett was like, you've just given me more work to do. Right
It was, it was amazing. But it also gave me insight into how I could use them. In fact, there were a couple of times where I was like, it would be really cool if you could do this. And Brett was like, you've just given me more work to do. Right Right. And indeed afterwards he wrote two blog posts, one that names me directly. And two that addresses a thing that I was I was talking about. And I also got to contribute in some small ways to some of the other tools that I was using of his. So that was that was a really cool and fun moment
Right. And indeed afterwards he wrote two blog posts, one that names me directly. And two that addresses a thing that I was I was talking about. And I also got to contribute in some small ways to some of the other tools that I was using of his. So that was that was a really cool and fun moment But but yeah, in this moment, I was like, I knew my limit with the old tool. And with the new tool, it felt like the limits just don't exist anymore. And you know, writing a blog post in the command line using NeoVem, feels like it's a task. Like we have better tools for that
But but yeah, in this moment, I was like, I knew my limit with the old tool. And with the new tool, it felt like the limits just don't exist anymore. And you know, writing a blog post in the command line using NeoVem, feels like it's a task. Like we have better tools for that But then some of the modernizations of these tools are amazing. We're like, I can quickly search for other references to other blog posts that I've made. And then like open those really quick copy the, you know, file name or whatever
But then some of the modernizations of these tools are amazing. We're like, I can quickly search for other references to other blog posts that I've made. And then like open those really quick copy the, you know, file name or whatever And quickly get a link or integrate Brett's search link with the ability to run commands from the command line. So I can not worry about getting any links for stuff that I do. And just at the end, clicking a button and having search link do all of the link grabbing for me
And quickly get a link or integrate Brett's search link with the ability to run commands from the command line. So I can not worry about getting any links for stuff that I do. And just at the end, clicking a button and having search link do all of the link grabbing for me But do it in a way that doesn't feel much more different than the code that I'm writing than the tests that I'm writing. And it was this moment where I was just like, wow, I, I forgot how amazing it feels. To not be at the plateau
But do it in a way that doesn't feel much more different than the code that I'm writing than the tests that I'm writing. And it was this moment where I was just like, wow, I, I forgot how amazing it feels. To not be at the plateau To not be at the place where I'm like, this is, this is where I've been operating at for the longest time. And to be able to incrementally improve and to get better and to think about like, how would I do a thing and to do things I haven't done before
To not be at the place where I'm like, this is, this is where I've been operating at for the longest time. And to be able to incrementally improve and to get better and to think about like, how would I do a thing and to do things I haven't done before Is I think that there's something fascinating about going back into that. And I'm really excited. But also shout out to the best theme on the planet, which is cat poochine. Cat poochine, it adds, it's coffee, it's cats
Is I think that there's something fascinating about going back into that. And I'm really excited. But also shout out to the best theme on the planet, which is cat poochine. Cat poochine, it adds, it's coffee, it's cats What else is there to ask for? If you haven't seen these Kathy, I just, I have to have you go look at the cappuccine just themes. Oh, they're, they're so nice. They're just. So it's for, it's a theme for everything
What else is there to ask for? If you haven't seen these Kathy, I just, I have to have you go look at the cappuccine just themes. Oh, they're, they're so nice. They're just. So it's for, it's a theme for everything So they have, they basically have a, like a, all these different projects that will allow you to quickly change how your, like, like your terminal would look for instance, I'm going to start copying links into our show notes with. Yeah, putting them in the show notes
So they have, they basically have a, like a, all these different projects that will allow you to quickly change how your, like, like your terminal would look for instance, I'm going to start copying links into our show notes with. Yeah, putting them in the show notes What? I know such a novel idea. And so like this idea here, that's for the terminal that I'm using. But I would need one for the code editor as well. So then I can go and start at cat poochine and then just go to the code editor that I use. They have a theme for that too
What? I know such a novel idea. And so like this idea here, that's for the terminal that I'm using. But I would need one for the code editor as well. So then I can go and start at cat poochine and then just go to the code editor that I use. They have a theme for that too And then, oh, I need one for previewing markdown. So then I can just go and find one for the markdown preview. And they're all the same level of theme. And the thing that makes cat poochine so pretty is that like one, it's a very soft color palette
And then, oh, I need one for previewing markdown. So then I can just go and find one for the markdown preview. And they're all the same level of theme. And the thing that makes cat poochine so pretty is that like one, it's a very soft color palette It uses a lot of like very muted but vibrant colors. So lots of pinks, lots of, you know, purples and greens. I like the things have the like hex code and RGB codes and stuff. So you can pull it out for other things. That's really cool. Yeah. Yeah. It's so nice
It uses a lot of like very muted but vibrant colors. So lots of pinks, lots of, you know, purples and greens. I like the things have the like hex code and RGB codes and stuff. So you can pull it out for other things. That's really cool. Yeah. Yeah. It's so nice Yeah. It's so nice. And I am, I'm just constantly amazed at I'm using this other thing. I wonder if there's a cat poochine theme for it. Oh, there is cool. Let me just have had now. And yes, they have some for browsers even
Yeah. It's so nice. And I am, I'm just constantly amazed at I'm using this other thing. I wonder if there's a cat poochine theme for it. Oh, there is cool. Let me just have had now. And yes, they have some for browsers even So if you want to, you know, make your browser look like that too, you can. I see, I see pro, I should get off of this page because I'm seeing like products that I use that I haven't added the theme to yet. So now I'm just like, oh, oh no
So if you want to, you know, make your browser look like that too, you can. I see, I see pro, I should get off of this page because I'm seeing like products that I use that I haven't added the theme to yet. So now I'm just like, oh, oh no You can change your Gmail client to match their color scheme. That's cool. Yeah. So yeah, just this, this all of this to say, oh cool. It also matches my Hobe Nietzsche speaking of my Hobe Nietzsche. Yeah. I've also started using my Hobe Nietzsche again
You can change your Gmail client to match their color scheme. That's cool. Yeah. So yeah, just this, this all of this to say, oh cool. It also matches my Hobe Nietzsche speaking of my Hobe Nietzsche. Yeah. I've also started using my Hobe Nietzsche again Like this is, I've talked about this the last couple of systems checks where I just feel like I haven't been using it. There was a part of me that felt like maybe this was a wasted, you know, a wasted investment
Like this is, I've talked about this the last couple of systems checks where I just feel like I haven't been using it. There was a part of me that felt like maybe this was a wasted, you know, a wasted investment But for the last few weeks, I've actually been getting in there and writing in it more. And I still don't, I'm still not happy with maybe how much I'm using it. I think that there is some. I would like to use it more, but I think I need the modularity still
But for the last few weeks, I've actually been getting in there and writing in it more. And I still don't, I'm still not happy with maybe how much I'm using it. I think that there is some. I would like to use it more, but I think I need the modularity still I definitely wish I had a way to add some blank pages in between. Maybe you give me like two pages per day or something like that. That would be fantastic so that I can take notes and have my notes be in my notebook as well. But I'm at least happy that I'm able to get back into my notebook
I definitely wish I had a way to add some blank pages in between. Maybe you give me like two pages per day or something like that. That would be fantastic so that I can take notes and have my notes be in my notebook as well. But I'm at least happy that I'm able to get back into my notebook I do think it helps me think I think it helps me process information a little bit better. So yeah, that's been my systems check
I do think it helps me think I think it helps me process information a little bit better. So yeah, that's been my systems check What about you? Yeah, so I've had the last couple months have had a lot of big changes in kind of the structure of my business and a variety of things that doesn't really matter. But something that I've learned that I'm missing is a better and more consistent capture tool
What about you? Yeah, so I've had the last couple months have had a lot of big changes in kind of the structure of my business and a variety of things that doesn't really matter. But something that I've learned that I'm missing is a better and more consistent capture tool And so I'm kind of playing around with a variety of different things so that stuff doesn't get missed, especially as I transition into this mode of my life and work business place that I'm at capturing is going to be the biggest hole that I'm trying to fill in
And so I'm kind of playing around with a variety of different things so that stuff doesn't get missed, especially as I transition into this mode of my life and work business place that I'm at capturing is going to be the biggest hole that I'm trying to fill in And so I'm currently trying out I have the sidekick notepad from Cortex brand. And it lives between my keyboard and myself. And when I first saw it, I was like, I don't know how that will work. I was worried about like ergonomic things. However, it's been really helpful
And so I'm currently trying out I have the sidekick notepad from Cortex brand. And it lives between my keyboard and myself. And when I first saw it, I was like, I don't know how that will work. I was worried about like ergonomic things. However, it's been really helpful Stranges this is so because I've had to push the keyboard back closer to the computer. I'm actually sitting better. So I sit upright a little bit more. I sit like my back is straighter. I have better posture when I'm typing now. Which is a benefit that I wasn't expecting
Stranges this is so because I've had to push the keyboard back closer to the computer. I'm actually sitting better. So I sit upright a little bit more. I sit like my back is straighter. I have better posture when I'm typing now. Which is a benefit that I wasn't expecting So because it because I have this notepad that just sits right here. It's got little bits of so for anyone that doesn't know what it looks like. It's got dark grid pages on like three quarters of it. And then to do list on the on the far right side
So because it because I have this notepad that just sits right here. It's got little bits of so for anyone that doesn't know what it looks like. It's got dark grid pages on like three quarters of it. And then to do list on the on the far right side And so I put my priorities for the week on the right side. And then I have space for notes or just whatever capturing pieces are so that I can then transfer any longer term stuff to omnifocus
And so I put my priorities for the week on the right side. And then I have space for notes or just whatever capturing pieces are so that I can then transfer any longer term stuff to omnifocus I do need to I'm hoping at one some point in the future going through I need to clean up my omnifocus a little bit. It's got a it's got a bunch of projects that are now no longer applicable. And so I need to I need to work on that. And because I'm changing how I'm using it a little bit
I do need to I'm hoping at one some point in the future going through I need to clean up my omnifocus a little bit. It's got a it's got a bunch of projects that are now no longer applicable. And so I need to I need to work on that. And because I'm changing how I'm using it a little bit I need to make some adjustments. But again, that's feature me. These problems. I'm I'm still I'm working through living with you know my day to day right now. I am still using my beautiful notebook therapy notebook and what I'm using it for for my bullet journaling. To basically plan out the week
I need to make some adjustments. But again, that's feature me. These problems. I'm I'm still I'm working through living with you know my day to day right now. I am still using my beautiful notebook therapy notebook and what I'm using it for for my bullet journaling. To basically plan out the week So I'll put in stuff that's scheduled. And like kind of overarching goals are not tasks necessarily but like here's here's some things that if I have some time to work on or that are not work related
So I'll put in stuff that's scheduled. And like kind of overarching goals are not tasks necessarily but like here's here's some things that if I have some time to work on or that are not work related I guess kind of so like I will write down hey I need to do laundry or I need to get through one of these boxes. It doesn't live in my sidekick sidekick no pad because it's not work related. But it still needs to get done. And so that lives in my bullet journal
I guess kind of so like I will write down hey I need to do laundry or I need to get through one of these boxes. It doesn't live in my sidekick sidekick no pad because it's not work related. But it still needs to get done. And so that lives in my bullet journal And so that's kind of where I'm at right now. I have a feeling that I will be making a lot of changes again in the future as where I'm at make some adjustments. It'll be interesting to see as always it's always interesting to kind of see how things move around
And so that's kind of where I'm at right now. I have a feeling that I will be making a lot of changes again in the future as where I'm at make some adjustments. It'll be interesting to see as always it's always interesting to kind of see how things move around And I don't ever change it just to change it. I'm changing it because something's not working. And I think that's something to take in and take to mind that a lot of like quote unquote productivity content creators will do is they make changes just so that they have specific content
And I don't ever change it just to change it. I'm changing it because something's not working. And I think that's something to take in and take to mind that a lot of like quote unquote productivity content creators will do is they make changes just so that they have specific content And that's something that I like about our systems check is that because it's far enough away like it's three months is long enough to make some minor changes without doing it for the Graham. For the ground though Kathy the ground. What a cry
And that's something that I like about our systems check is that because it's far enough away like it's three months is long enough to make some minor changes without doing it for the Graham. For the ground though Kathy the ground. What a cry What a cry. I I too I think we talked about this in our co working but I I'm currently not using my psychic desk is a psych the psychic notepad the one that reads your thoughts
What a cry. I I too I think we talked about this in our co working but I I'm currently not using my psychic desk is a psych the psychic notepad the one that reads your thoughts The sidekick notepad but I am using a similar like desk pad for plotter to kind of be that page in between the days that I need and I think it's interesting that we're using it kind of in the same way of that I have like four active projects that I'm working on
The sidekick notepad but I am using a similar like desk pad for plotter to kind of be that page in between the days that I need and I think it's interesting that we're using it kind of in the same way of that I have like four active projects that I'm working on So for the week I kind of write down just what I need to get done in the in each of those four projects and I just keep it like on that page and then things that don't get done at the end of the week kind of get moved over again like that whole bullet journaling thing but it's it's a nice week like hey you're the thoughts for the week but then the day to day is kind of a different mental model
So for the week I kind of write down just what I need to get done in the in each of those four projects and I just keep it like on that page and then things that don't get done at the end of the week kind of get moved over again like that whole bullet journaling thing but it's it's a nice week like hey you're the thoughts for the week but then the day to day is kind of a different mental model So I like that I'm super excited that you know something like that works for you as well but I love that I don't put it in between me and my keyboard I put it next to my keyboard because again I had the same thoughts of you of like I use fountain pens my my four arms will rest on that paper so I will walk up with like purple all over my I'm using my mark one on the sidekick no pad so it doesn't get all over my so there's that that's fair is that so this episode of conduit is brought to you also my micro dot blog blogging is still the easiest way to share stuff on the web and my micro dot blog is the easiest way to blog personal blogging is making a comeback thanks to all the disruption in social media so if you have always wanted to build your own place on the internet to keep and share the stuff you love my micro dot blog is for you micro dot blog is the blog you will actually use because we've made it so easy to write short or long blog posts share photos keep a log of the books you read and even create your own podcast but more than a place to post your stuff it's also a friendly community of people with a wide range of interests who share and comment via micro dot blog social online which is managed by humans not bots it's a social network you can feel good about and because micro dot blog is open you can use your own domain name cross post to Twitter or X tumbler and you can also follow and be followed by master on users directly with conversations threading across both micro dot blog and master on and finally you can share your RSS feed so anyone can follow you micro dot blog hosting starts at just $5 a month head over to micro dot blog and sign up for the 30 day free trial use the coupon code and you'll get a special deal with your standard subscription you will get a premium account and no extra charge that's $5 a month for hosting that includes all our premium features including podcast hosting that's a savings of 50% micro dot blog and code relay our thanks to micro dot blog for their support of the show and all of relay
