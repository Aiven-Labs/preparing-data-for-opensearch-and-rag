Hello beautiful humans. Welcome back to Teach Shantek and we have Ben here today and we're going to learn lots of fun stuff. So please introduce yourself and what we're going to be learning about today. Howdy howdy y'all it is great to be here. My name is Ben by day I'm a software developer at Microsoft working on their documentation site. But where folks probably know me around is that I am a web accessibility advocate. That's what we're going to be talking about today. But I've blogged about accessibility at Ben Myers
I'm a software developer at Microsoft working on their documentation site. But where folks probably know me around is that I am a web accessibility advocate. That's what we're going to be talking about today. But I've blogged about accessibility at Ben Myersdev and I actually host a stream of my own called some antics where every week I bring on a guest from around web development and web design to teach me something about building great user experiences for the web in a hands-on way with a focus on accessibility and core web technologies
dev and I actually host a stream of my own called some antics where every week I bring on a guest from around web development and web design to teach me something about building great user experiences for the web in a hands-on way with a focus on accessibility and core web technologies Jen do you think I need any more caffeine? I'm still like I have my rocks are in the background so I have water. I'm thinking of my caffeine too. I have caffeinated water right here
Jen do you think I need any more caffeine? I'm still like I have my rocks are in the background so I have water. I'm thinking of my caffeine too. I have caffeinated water right here Yeah it's like flavor packets that you can like mix into your water like fruit flavor packets that like have caffeine in them. I don't know I dig it. All right all right I didn't even realize that you know I came here on the stream and I'm already feeling so attacked right now Jen
Yeah it's like flavor packets that you can like mix into your water like fruit flavor packets that like have caffeine in them. I don't know I dig it. All right all right I didn't even realize that you know I came here on the stream and I'm already feeling so attacked right now Jen What you're teaching me all the new things already? Exactly there we go. Anyways yeah so we're going to be talking about web accessibility
What you're teaching me all the new things already? Exactly there we go. Anyways yeah so we're going to be talking about web accessibility And before I get too much into what we're doing today I wanted to actually get a feeler from you Jen as to what is your understanding of web accessibility and what entails. There are no wrong answers here. I just kind of want to see where you're at just to start
And before I get too much into what we're doing today I wanted to actually get a feeler from you Jen as to what is your understanding of web accessibility and what entails. There are no wrong answers here. I just kind of want to see where you're at just to start And I appreciate that and I love this is something that I really appreciate when guests do this just in general checking and understanding of where someone's at before explaining it because then it also helps someone course correct or add to their understanding so thank you for us off for asking
And I appreciate that and I love this is something that I really appreciate when guests do this just in general checking and understanding of where someone's at before explaining it because then it also helps someone course correct or add to their understanding so thank you for us off for asking I would say if I let's say when I think about web accessibility I think of we talked a bit about screen readers which we will go into a bit more about that you would explain it so much more not the same as text to speech which I learned
I would say if I let's say when I think about web accessibility I think of we talked a bit about screen readers which we will go into a bit more about that you would explain it so much more not the same as text to speech which I learned And the reason I mentioned that is text to speech does not or something that is not accessible is if you put a PDF or excuse me a PNG or like a photo of a graphic that is not something that's accessible to a screen reader or a or excuse me a text to speech. They can't read a PNG a lot of times
And the reason I mentioned that is text to speech does not or something that is not accessible is if you put a PDF or excuse me a PNG or like a photo of a graphic that is not something that's accessible to a screen reader or a or excuse me a text to speech. They can't read a PNG a lot of times And then also colors. Okay what have you heard about colors Jen? Uh what a Brazil. Hey Brazil. Good to have you. That not everyone can see all of the colors so it there are web accessible colors but also being able to invert the colors
And then also colors. Okay what have you heard about colors Jen? Uh what a Brazil. Hey Brazil. Good to have you. That not everyone can see all of the colors so it there are web accessible colors but also being able to invert the colors Okay interesting interesting good to kind of see where where that's at
Okay interesting interesting good to kind of see where where that's at Yeah so accessibility this is this is one of the hard things and actually one of the things that I should give as a caveat before we get too deep into this which is that web accessibility is a massive umbrella and there's no way I can teach you everything you need to know about accessibility in an hour there's no way I can teach you everything you need to know about accessibility in a day in a week right it's a continual learning process right so today my goal is not to teach you my goal is not to make you an accessibility My goal is to just kind of provide an entryway get you start to think like an accessibility practitioner and hopefully get you to the point where you could start to discover more
Yeah so accessibility this is this is one of the hard things and actually one of the things that I should give as a caveat before we get too deep into this which is that web accessibility is a massive umbrella and there's no way I can teach you everything you need to know about accessibility in an hour there's no way I can teach you everything you need to know about accessibility in a day in a week right it's a continual learning process right so today my goal is not to teach you my goal is not to make you an accessibility My goal is to just kind of provide an entryway get you start to think like an accessibility practitioner and hopefully get you to the point where you could start to discover more Captions. That's another one yes absolutely. I might randomly be yelling these out the entire time
Captions. That's another one yes absolutely. I might randomly be yelling these out the entire time So accessibility I would define as like or web accessibility broadly I would define as you know usability for disabled users right we are making sure our site is usable by disabled users and if you think about like the words disabled users seem so simple right but that is a plethora of people right there's a diversity of experiences because disabilities come in all shape forms there many kinds of disabilities that all have their own needs two people with similar disabilities could still have entirely different needs and also one of the things I think often gets left out when we talk about disability is that if you have one disability surprise you actually usually have at least three right and so there's this intersection of different disabilities so if we're you know talking about this like theoretical disabled person right there's only so much of you know people's experience we can capture with that right so as part of this what I'd like to do is just spend some time that's going to sound a little ridiculous but I'd love to just spend some time Jen if you could just name some disabilities you know up just as many as you can think of another one that came to mind and this goes to naming a disability blindness and there's different degrees of blindness and that reminded me of another one which is increase in font size or different font styles and boldness as other accessibility options um death uh not being able to use the screen itself mattering if that's because of hands or something like not being able to use the screen itself um or a website itself um death I feel like on the spot that I'm not I'm like playing with them um and by the way folks in the chat if you want to comment um just some of the various disabilities you know of again I know this exercise seems a little ridiculous but just name as many as you know um but it's you know it can be hard to think of these things on the spot one thing that might help is that um many accessible uh yes absolutely results fine of the fighter yes um what is fine in defyte that is you know wonderful that is you know I'm pulling up Wikipedia because I'm not going to do it justice um let's see here what is fine in defyte is a birth defect of where there is an incomplete closing of the spine and the membranes around the spinal cord around uh during early uh development and pregnancy um so yes it is uh a disability of the spine um but yeah so um gotcha okay uh okay results husbands twin brother has that so it affects his walking absolutely um so many accessibility practitioners will uh just to kind of help us start to think about disability in a way that we can start to incorporate into our work they'll categorize different kinds of disabilities so there is your vision disabilities you mentioned blindness there's also low vision right which is a degree of blindness um but a low vision user might have different needs in a blind user so we might also separate those there's also color blindness um etc um you know um color blindness especially prevalent in men i want to say like eight percent of men like one and every twelve men um has some form of color blindness most commonly red green color blindness um so color blindness is something to consider there um there's hearing impairments we've talked about that a bit i'm myself in hard of hearing so i can i i can relate um there's you know you've got your like mobility um disabilities things like spina bapida but also a more links awesome um i just posted it because it's the disability and health overview from the cdc okay but i like the way you're explaining it so i don't want to know you're good over to that i just really want to make sure we have the link you're totally good um so mobility uh disorders could be you know something like limb deformities like i've got um you could have for instance Parkinson's right um you you could have arthritis there's um you know so many things and what those are ultimately going to do is probably impact your ability to do things with precision right um it might be hard like you might not have the fine motor abilities to be able to move your mouse exactly where it needs to be for instance um and then there's a whole host of cognitive disabilities as well um we could talk about like there's ADHD there's autism there's short-term memory loss there's dyslexia dyscalculia right there's so many right we we could spend all day naming a bunch of disabilities but broadly speaking right this is a diversity of experiences and everyone with those disabilities is going to have some impact on their ability to navigate web and our goal as web accessibility practitioners you and i gen um is to ensure that those people still have equitable access to their sites um this could be you know something as seemingly unimportant as being able to order a pizza online to something all the way as like critical as managing your finances i used to work at a bank and one of the things we were taught is that um elders uh you know as as they old as they old old is officially verb-apparently as they age um as a result of both physical and mental disabilities that they could get while aging um they aren't always able to manage their finances independently they often have oftentimes have to have a younger family member or a loved one deal with their finances for them and this actually puts them at significant risk of being taken advantage of elder fraud elder abuse is absolutely a common thing that banks have to worry about um but you know if a website were designed such that you know our grandmothers could manage like their finances independently that puts them in a situation where they're less likely to get taken advantage of right so this is a direct tangible way in which accessibility seriously matters for real people there is a lot to take in there and yeah i love um how you mentioned also so like physical disabilities um like we talked about like the blindness or hearing or those type of things but also the invisible ones um like uh dyslexia and um you know ADHD it's it's weird because those are things i'm very passionate about yeah i sometimes forget that they are also disabilities yeah because the term neuro diversity is used instead and it's it's so true that they are because there are a lot of things that i need help with on websites like i was talking earlier about the screen read or text to speech um i don't know maybe i'm going to be using a screen reader after this so i really appreciate you going through all those and sharing those experiences because um the list that the website says is vision movement thinking remembering learning communicating hearing mental health and social relationships and everything you just mentioned falls into that and i learned a lot easier by somebody talking to me about it then reading off a web of a website and i think that is so cool having these type of conversations because it's different avenues of learning as well absolutely um and ultimately like the hardest part of accessibility right is the empathy part because you know i'm disabled you're disabled right we we have disabilities uh but we don't have all of them right we don't have universal disability experiences because there's no such thing right and so ultimately as web accessibility practitioners anyone who's doing web accessibility is going to have to try to find a way to put themselves in other people's shoes right um they're going to encounter the web in ways in which you know you and i don't on a day-to-day day basis right and still have to figure out what is a meaningful experience um i've also put another link in the twitch chat this is uh so uh backing up here the like all the specs that are standard for the web are put together by an organization called the worldwide web consortium and they have a kind of sub organization called the web accessibility initiative or wai and so i've shared a link to a resource from them um uh this uh w3
So accessibility I would define as like or web accessibility broadly I would define as you know usability for disabled users right we are making sure our site is usable by disabled users and if you think about like the words disabled users seem so simple right but that is a plethora of people right there's a diversity of experiences because disabilities come in all shape forms there many kinds

basis right and still have to figure out what is a meaningful experience um i've also put another link in the twitch chat this is uh so uh backing up here the like all the specs that are standard for the web are put together by an organization called the worldwide web consortium and they have a kind of sub organization called the web accessibility initiative or wai and so i've shared a link to a resource from them um uh this uh w3org slash wai slash roles slash users well and what this is is um i was at the one i was thinking there there was hang on i think they've changed things but um there's an introduction to web accessibility here too that i think is would be very helpful oh here's the page i was looking for i'm sorry it's um i've just put in the twitch chat it's this uh people dash use dash web um then what this does is this kind of goes through like basically personas of um people with different disabilities and kind of talks through how their disabilities impact their web experience um so for instance because i'm hard of hearing you know things like listening to podcasts online or watching videos online can be difficult unless there are captions or transcripts right um and so this page is a good way we won't be going through this today but like this is a great place to just kind of get an overview for um how might disability intersect with um you know people's experience of the web this uh yeah this is absolutely worth giving a read one thing that i think is um i i'm wondering how when you talked about it that it overlaps is like i believe you mentioned about languages and being able to make that accessible as well would that go into web accessibility or would that be like a different this is an interesting question and this is something i think folks in accessibility spaces can sometimes disagree with each other on um you'll have some people for instance that will start in things like performance into web accessibility um because you know if you if your site is slow and takes forever uh then you significantly disadvantage people from like areas with lower socioeconomic status right um and so folks will make the case that like performance enables access therefore performance as accessibility i tend to focus specifically like the i think performance and internationalization and the like these things are very important i prefer to focus web accessibility as a category on disability in particular um however i think there are still a lot of intersections between performance and accessibility and accessibility and internationalization folks will disagree with me on that but um yeah i'm curious if that changes based on the target audience of the the website um for example if we're talking about a you know having to work on any government documentation like let's say getting um one that comes to mind and is close to my heart of immigrants like if they're unable to read the government websites because they don't speak english i'm like oh okay cool yeah that's probably something that it may fall into accessibility whereas if we're talking about you know apis um maybe not something that's as important i don't know like that's uh that's just what came to my mind and i can see it being debated either way but that's uh that's a conversation for another day yeah um yeah so this is probably what we're doing right is we're like and for the purposes of today we're defining accessibility specifically around usability for disabled people right which has a lot of intersections with other parts of the web um there are many reasons to care about web accessibility um i find i like to think of it in terms of like what anchors developers to accessibility rather than like you know what are what are the like motivations um so my my anchors are that um it's personal for me because i'm disabled um i believe that access is a fundamental right i believe this is uh you know it i believe it's a civil right i believe that this is the right thing to do um i also in my experience i found that um accessible sites usually require a stronger foundation of like our html and stuff like that um in such a way that actually makes our site more robust for a lot of other things that we might care about like performance or internationalization or search engine optimization right like accessibility is a vehicle to get to other things our businesses care about as well um stuff like that and also just you know i work in the front end usability is the job i feel right like you're if if you're a front end developer your job is fundamentally to create a usable experience whether you're doing that with you know some framework like react or you know whether you're doing that with you know just plain html or whether you have whatever back end right does not matter your user doesn't care your business partners don't even care the only people who care are developers right um because at the end of the day the interface that comes out is what matters right that's what users see they don't care what tools you've used for this they don't care that you've slung around some JavaScript in a cool way they care about whether they can use it so usability is fundamentally your job right and i don't know of any front end developer who wouldn't be at least somewhat bummed if they found out that someone couldn't use their site for some reason so usability is is is the job so um there are other anchors that people have um some people will point to something called a curb cut effect which is in disability academia it's the notion that accommodations for disabled people can indirectly benefit non disabled people as well in ways that you don't expect like closed captions are a prime example therefore people who are hard of hearing or deaf or have auditory processing disorders but they also benefit people who are you know in the bar right and and there's a sports game that they want to watch but they're in a bar it's loud other people will point to lawsuits uh there are there are lawsuits websites have like businesses have gotten sued because their websites are inaccessible um so folks will will point to that as an anchor um stuff like that there's there's tons of like things that could anchor you to accessibility and i would encourage anyone who's interested to kind of start to think about why they care um i can't give you that answer right but those are some of the reasons i care about this thank you for sharing that and this may be a question for another day but i would love to have you on the show again to also specifically talk about accessibility for developers um because it's that's a big reason why an anchor for me of starting teach gen tech is showing people that tech is accessible for everyone and it's not something that is just if you know you can afford a bootcamp or something like that yeah so i would love to have that conversation with you later i know we don't have the time today so a point i'll make is that right now in some ways tech is not accessible for everyone right you know because like a lot of our resources are like video courses that don't have captions and stuff like that or blogs where the images don't have alt text and stuff like that right it tech could be accessible to everyone but in the context of disability and in in this case um you know it isn't always right and so i think considering accessibility like like within the industry is is is very good right um so yeah um wow it is amazing how how time flies though uh do you want to look at a website do you want to okay so i built ahead of time and um hi i should give the caveat first of all uh that i did not totally build this i actually found a template um from a site called html
org slash wai slash roles slash users well and what this is is um i was at the one i was thinking there there was hang on i think they've changed things but um there's an introduction to web accessibility here too that i think is would be very helpful oh here's the page i was looking for i'm sorry it's um i've just put in the twitch chat it's this uh people dash use dash web um then what

specifically talk about accessibility for developers um because it's that's a big reason why an anchor for me of starting teach gen tech is showing people that tech is accessible for everyone and it's not something that is just if you know you can afford a bootcamp or something like that yeah so i would love to have that conversation with you later i know we don't have the time today so a point

so i think considering accessibility like like within the industry is is is very good right um so yeah um wow it is amazing how how time flies though uh do you want to look at a website do you want to okay so i built ahead of time and um hi i should give the caveat first of all uh that i did not totally build this i actually found a template um from a site called htmldesign and then i adapted it to make it inaccessible i'll share a link to you're looking at the hosted version right now and i'll share a link to if anyone wants the hub repo because we are going to be messing with the code a bit today share a link to that as well let me just get that first um so i've put these links uh in the the twitch chat so my goal here is i've put together um this is a very possible seeming modern day website um that's riddled with inaccessibility issues um and so today we're gonna just spend some time putting ourselves in the shoes of various disabled people figure out where they might have some problems and see if there's ways that we can fix them in some cases or at least kind of talk about at a high level what we could do to fix some of these things so uh at first i think we should just do some kind of exploration phase i i think we should just kind of look around the site um and if you're finding something where in your mind like you're like hang on a person with such and such disability is already going to struggle with this uh just kind of call it out i kind of want to just know your free and open thoughts about uh about the site for sure and what up anthony thank you anthony you're joining as you can um so to recap because looking at the the chat totally distracted me call these out as we're exploring or wait yeah just just kind of look them look look around and you really like hey i can think of you know um and if it would help we can also just straight up maybe come up with a few um disabilities that we could try to specifically put ourselves in the the shoes of but yeah just kind of look around the site and see if you can identify anything that you think would be an access problem to someone i've already blown up this um um this page quite a bit and this text is still incredibly hard to read it is it's something that a lot of the text can be hard to read i also know this because on my podcast website i really like this cursive and i always have to think about that i can't overuse it because it's not accessible and um it's it can be very hard to read um is there a way to see if i don't know if it's s-e-o or if it's um accessibility but there's i feel like there's a way that you can put text as an explanation of an image i just make it look so yeah so what you're describing is something called alternative text or alt text for short um so there is an accessibility requirement and you should put a pin in that uh that i just mentioned the word requirement you should put a pin in that um but there's an accessibility requirement that like any non-text content um that isn't decorative um needs to be described with some alternative right um and so for images when we've got like the image tag the like you know angle brackets i-m-g uh there's an attribute that you can add called alt um and in there you put a description of the image right um and the goal of that is that you describe basically what someone's saying um and and you convey this to for instance people who use screen readers um a screen reader user could navigate to that image with their screen reader and they would be told whatever the contents of that alt text are um and so so there's tons of blog posts out there of like oh how do you write good meaningful uh alt text for me it boils down to one heuristic which is that i like to imagine them on the phone chatting with a friend now i want to tell them about this cool image i have in front of me that's how i like to think about it um that's what keeps me like you know making sure i'm providing enough detail that it's meaningful without going overboard um because you know you can start to do things like um well you know if i'm talking to a person a friend you know and maybe the image i've got in front of me is a picture of president Joe Biden right um i could just say it's a picture of president Biden you know maybe describe what he's wearing what he's doing right but it's president i don't have to say you know a white man with white hair wearing a suit right i could say president Biden because people who know who that is right um so it yeah the the whole imagine amount of phone call thing is a a heuristic i found is is really helpful for me at least um but yeah so you've called out that like hey you know we don't know yet but it seems like maybe this image isn't being described with alt text or at least you wouldn't put it past me to have not described this image with alt text okay and i have so many like follow up questions later on so Ben you're i'm hoping to volunteer you you'll have to come back because there's so much on this um and uh i don't know about the images yeah so this is because this is a scaffold it's like we're gonna see tons of like placeholder images yeah yeah that's that's not part of it's just i didn't have time to go find a picture of strawberry i think the alt text also shows up here but i i think the part that i was just kind of stuck on is i don't know if the vegetarian part is gonna be readable here let me let somebody know if they are um you know if that is something that would be able to be screen red um as a general rule text on the page is able to be screen red now whether it's like meaningfully associated with the other contents is kind of a different story right but like gotta folks using a screen reader in particular would be able to get to the word veg or non-beds it okay cool there's there's caveats and stuff like that and your your information architecture needs to be good but like broadly speaking that won't be an issue um okay okay i don't think i am seeing okay really other than colors tell me more if you if your color blind you're not gonna be able to differentiate very well with like the reds i believe reds are not a color that is color accessible i remember correctly this this is interesting you can so first of all um so what we're describing here is something called color contrast the idea here is that we have some text on a background and that text needs to stand out from the background right for it to be readable um and so typically what we would need to do is we would want to compare the color of the text to the color of its background um and so in the case of like this nav bar that we've got where it says home recipes restaurants we would want to compare the white of the words the white of the text with the this kind of like red background do you want to do that um sure okay so here's what we're gonna do is um can you right click on like one of those links and then do inspect element uh inspect the yeah there we go and then over in the uh very bottom right you can see that the uh color of the nav link is pure white fffff yeah it's pure white okay so that's gonna be easy to remember but um then if you in the kind of elements pain to the left if you scroll up a bit there's gonna be um it's uh i want to say it's the div class equals container is what has the red uh oh no i'm sorry it's the header class equals header that's what it is and so now if you go to the the right there's this background color EA3 c53 so let's copy and paste or let's let's copy that like xcode there done all right now uh we're gonna go to google and we're gonna uh search for a colored contrast checker there's tons of these out there uh there's one that i end up using quite a bit but um virtually any of them will do uh that first one is the one i end up using so let's use that um this is by a resource called web aim which is a fantastic website to learn about web accessibility so yep it's five right six there'll be six of those yep all right so let's scroll down and let's see what we're we're finding here first of all that sure is a lot of acronyms and gobbly goop right and you've got this number thing what's the deal with this number so first of all um i guess what is your first question from when like when you're seeing this like what is the first question that comes to mind question um would be yes i'm curious what the aspect ratio is but just taking a look at this i like how it automatically gave us something that would be a pass so it doesn't make me like have to think about it very much it makes me go oh okay cool like uh the graphical objects and user interface components i'm like that would be the easiest and like not a ton of thought process going into it but the normal versus large text i'm like oh yeah that totally makes sense um but the contrast ratio the biggest thing is what's the best score yeah okay so let's let's talk about this uh as for your question of what's the best score contrast ratios are on a scale of one to one to 21 to one so one to one is you compare the color against itself there is no contrast because it's literally the same color right um and then the max is 21 to one and there's only one color combination that can give you that do you want to take a guess what that would be black and white that's correct yay so um so what we can see here is that uh we're uh it is kind of this like exponential thing of like once you start getting more contrast you get more and more contrast faster um so a lot of the colors that we tend to see in the web tend to fall in this like you know three forest range probably a little lower as well but um let's talk about these like pass and fail tests uh first of all there is this wcag and that stands for web content accessibility guidelines those are the guidelines those are the requirements i mentioned earlier they're what that we should put a pin in the fact that there are accessibility requirements those accessibility requirements are the web content accessibility guidelines or wikag and they have different standards for different kinds of content when it comes to contrast um so uh wikag has like three tiers of strictness there's level a which is like you've maybe thought about accessibility before there's double a which is the industry standard and then there's triple a which is like wow you're like super compatible with all the things um so double a is usually what we target it's the industry standard it's the legal standard if you're thinking about this in terms of compliance and not getting sued so with that in mind what we're looking at here is we care about all the lines that say wikag a a um because a a a is usually not within uh reason for us it's it's kind of the pie in the sky ideally you could meet this but most people don't try um so with that in mind for large text wikag like some for for large text we're passing and large text there there's a whole definition of it but basically it's either big or bold is what it translates you could read the explanation but there's because there's like a like specific combination there but you know bigger bold but uh in large text needs to meet a ratio of three to one well we're almost four to one right so we're doing pretty good if this were large text if this were like a heading right but it's not it's you know a normal size link normal text which we can see we're failing needs to meet 4
design and then i adapted it to make it inaccessible i'll share a link to you're looking at the hosted version right now and i'll share a link to if anyone wants the hub repo because we are going to be messing with the code a bit today share a link to that as well let me just get that first um so i've put these links uh in the the twitch chat so my goal here is i've put together um this is a very possible seeming modern day website um that's riddled with inaccessibility issues um and so today we're gonna just spend some time putting ourselves in the shoes of various disabled people figure out

this were like a heading right but it's not it's you know a normal size link normal text which we can see we're failing needs to meet 45 to one um anyways so yeah that is we have we've been bumping up the font it's been fun um there we go yeah there we go so i wrote a blog post actually about color contrast that i'm going to link in the twitch chat uh not here on the twitch side you're missing out um but yes so i wrote a blog post on the subject um that folks who want to absolutely should check out but um as it stands our color for the size of our text doesn't work so if we go back to the um yeah to our little demo site here um and we look at that nav bar again like like like just yeah we have two ways we could fix this do you want to take a guess what those two ways are we could make it um bold or larger text but the suggested way from the web contrast checker was to make it have a white bar behind it and black text so that way it has the highest contrast contrast you you could go out you you don't need to have the like white and black you you you you don't need to do that what you can instead do probably is like pick a darker red right um and so uh there was a tool recently i ended up using um let's see uh let me send okay i'm gonna send the link in the twitch chat but i'm also going to send this in our like uh private stream yard chat so you can see this um oh no see that works yeah so what you've done is you come up with a color that works really well for every center right you you could do this and if if you want we could do this on our our little local version of the code if if you want um i feel like this does show a pretty good explanation of it because then you can move these around to be able to see like maybe some colors you might like or don't like and then even changing um to different parts so that's the background and then going like this yeah that's cool so i love playing around with the other site i've linked you to let's you plug in two colors and then it'll be like hey i found the closest match basically um to get like the the ratio you want so like there are tools to help you like pick better colors that are going to work but broadly speaking for this particular issue we know how to fix this right we could either make the text bigger or we could pick a different red right or a different color altogether right um so um yeah i love that and so that makes sense we already talked about the ones on the screen and it's text did i miss anything um that's a great question you have but that's okay right um because this this site is basically the site is designed as a choose your own adventure when it comes to accessibility right like uh this is a you you figure out a few things that are interesting and of note and you um like we we follow that trail right and part of the thing is you're not going to be able to see like literally visually see everything that's wrong with the site um but maybe let's follow one of these links and they're all going to take you to like the same like dummy like recipe page um because there's only one of those on the site but now we have a new page and so maybe maybe we spend some time on this page just kind looking around seeing what um what there is it doesn't look like this had auto captions burned into it but you can turn them on yeah absolutely um yeah Anthony's right i just used that tool yesterday to fix something on his podcast site um sorry the contrast finder one um yeah so with captions there's this notion of open captions versus closed captions where open captions are the ones that are like burned into the pixels of the video itself and closed captions are the ones that you could toggle on and off i personally in my experience as a deaf person i prefer closed captions um that they usually let me change uh how the captions look um if the captions are wrong or if they're in the way i can turn them on and off so i personally prefer closed captions there's new ones as to when you might want to use open captions but um yeah the the the fact is like there there are at least automated closed captions on this video so i wouldn't necessarily flag that as a problem cool and i i did want to like turn it to a part just to see if they had it with open captions um let's see what else um i can make the touch do you think they're well the color is again yeah we know how to fix that for sure um it's still small so exactly the same but pretty similar and those those grades are pretty light aren't they yes so we could conjecture and i'll go ahead and confirm but we could conjecture that those grades don't pass color contrast requirements either interesting do people like get paid to like go through websites to check accessibility yeah there are services i know um one service is called tenon
5 to one um anyways so yeah that is we have we've been bumping up the font it's been fun um there we go yeah there we go so i wrote a blog post actually about color contrast that i'm going to link in the twitch chat uh not here on the twitch side you're missing out um but yes so i wrote a blog post on the subject um that folks who want to absolutely should check out but um as it stands our color for the size of our text doesn't work so if we go back to the um yeah to our little demo site here um and we look at that nav bar again like like like just yeah we have two ways we could fix this do

aren't they yes so we could conjecture and i'll go ahead and confirm but we could conjecture that those grades don't pass color contrast requirements either interesting do people like get paid to like go through websites to check accessibility yeah there are services i know um one service is called tenonio it's run by an accessibility practitioner named Karl groves um he's he's a a contractor like like you could hire out basically to do an audit of your site there are services they'll do that yeah um that is cool and Anthony's right yeah and then they should be paid way more yeah like um in general there's there's a lot of times you you'll see like companies that don't value accessibility expertise we'll try to find a way to like you know get that expertise for free which is absolutely kind of sickening plague on the accessibility community is it's companies that don't value accessibility work but just want like the free labor basically um yeah um but i'll tell you how i really feel um but anyways yeah let's let's keep going all right uh Anthony did just comment uh accessibility is so technically challenging and incredibly appointment appointment important and no one values it enough i can definitely i already had like some ideas of this beforehand and now just talking today i'm just like yeah it's even more um i would say in general this text is kind of hard to read it isn't it yeah the it's funny fun fact i did not change anything about that text from the template i grabbed this from um but it's is that way this doesn't look like aerial or times new roman it looks like something else no there might be months there i i think that's actually months there but is there a font that is more accessible on websites than others that's a great question so i actually did a stream with um a uh professional typographer named Bruno Mog um let me let me see if I can find a link to this um yeah there there are fonts that do score better on readability um basically it there's there's uh hang on sorry i'm doing too many things at once but there's um there are kind of attributes that lead to generally more readable thoughts um so you want something that's like thick enough you also want something that uh has fairly even sproke with um throughout right like you don't want something where like the vertical lines are really thick and then the horizontal lines are really thin or something like that that tends to pose a readability problem um but yes absolutely there are um you know fonts that are more or less readable overall um there we go there was one that that i was told about because of being dyslexic called comic mono and that is something and there's plugins for a browser to do it so that way because one thing that you mentioned earlier is they're not all disabilities disabilities different disabilities have different needs so it may not be the type of thing that i would want to put an entire website in this comic mono but finding some better a bit better for it so thank you for seeing that so there yeah the the whole subject of dyslexia uh like dyslexia fonts is kind of a tricky one um there are fonts that will claim to be dyslexia friendly that maybe don't have as rigorous academic backing as you might think um however if they work for you you should absolutely have the choice to use them um and this is a thing that hits home a lot in accessibility is that because there's a plethora of experience and you can't just like make one broad statement about um any disabled people or any group of disabled people um choice personalization is something that matters right the ability to stop like often to a bigger font size or even a different font altogether or you know like mode versus dark mode or something like that like being able to opt into the settings that work best for you is a huge part of accessibility because the thing that people get wrong about universal design is um that you can and should have a one size fits all solution you can't because everyone's different but uh instead what you can do is you can enable people with your design to pick the approaches that work best for them um that that's making me rethink about how yes i want a technology to be accessible for everyone yeah you're absolutely right it's it's never going to be fully accessible for everyone but with these type of tools it can make it accessible for more people so i really appreciated that call out earlier um we are just talked about the gray yeah that's a really like gray yep and i know i'm probably missing more but i feel like those were the because these doctors really hard to see too they are aren't they yeah and just a such a small font here anyone else seeing something that i may have missed Anthony are you seeing anything
io it's run by an accessibility practitioner named Karl groves um he's he's a a contractor like like you could hire out basically to do an audit of your site there are services they'll do that yeah um that is cool and Anthony's right yeah and then they should be paid way more yeah like um in general there's there's a lot of times you you'll see like companies that don't value accessibility expertise we'll try to find a way to like you know get that expertise for free which is absolutely kind of sickening plague on the accessibility community is it's companies that don't value accessibility work but just want like the free labor basically um yeah um but i'll tell you how i really feel um but anyways yeah let's let's keep going all right uh Anthony did just comment uh accessibility is so technically challenging and incredibly appointment appointment important and no one values it enough i can definitely i already had like some ideas of this beforehand and now just talking today i'm just like yeah it's even more um i would say in general this text is kind of hard to read it isn't it yeah the it's funny fun fact i did not change anything about that text from the template i grabbed this from um but it's is that way this doesn't look like aerial or times new roman it looks like something else no there might be months there i i think that's actually months there but is there a font that is more accessible on websites than others that's a great question so i actually did a stream with um a uh professional typographer named Bruno Mog um let me let me see if I can find a link to this um yeah there there are fonts that do score better on readability um basically it there's there's uh hang on sorry i'm doing too many things at once but there's um there are kind of attributes that lead to generally more readable thoughts um so you want something that's like thick enough you also want something that uh has fairly even sproke with um throughout right like you don't want something where like the vertical lines are really thick and then the horizontal lines are really thin or something like that that tends to pose a readability problem um but yes absolutely there are um you know fonts that are more or less readable overall um there we go there was one that that i was told about because of being dyslexic called comic mono and that is something and there's plugins for a browser to do it so that way because one thing that you mentioned earlier is they're not all disabilities disabilities different disabilities have different needs so it may not be the type of thing that i would want to put an entire website in this comic mono but finding some better a bit better for it so thank you for seeing that so there yeah the the whole subject of dyslexia uh like dyslexia fonts is kind of a tricky one um there are fonts that will claim to be dyslexia friendly that maybe don't have as rigorous academic backing as you might think um however if they work for you you should absolutely have the choice to use them um and this is a thing that hits home a lot in accessibility is that because there's a plethora of experience and you can't just like make one broad statement about um any disabled people or any group of disabled people um choice personalization is something that matters right the ability to stop like often to a bigger font size or even a different font altogether or you know like mode versus dark mode or something like that like being able to opt into the settings that work best for you is a huge part of accessibility because the thing that people get wrong about universal design is um that you can and should have a one size fits all solution you can't because everyone's different but uh instead what you can do is you can enable people with your design to pick the approaches that work best for them um that that's making me rethink about how yes i want a technology to be accessible for everyone yeah you're absolutely right it's it's never going to be fully accessible for everyone but with these type of tools it can make it accessible for more people so i really appreciated that call out earlier um we are just talked about the gray yeah that's a really like gray yep and i know i'm probably missing more but i feel like those were the because these doctors really hard to see too they are aren't they yeah and just a such a small font here anyone else seeing something that i may have missed Anthony are you seeing anything because i did probably miss something i should say what did i miss
because i did probably miss something i should say what did i miss No i'm um oh uh yeah i can work on that Anthony broadly speaking so we're looking at a and i'm hosting this uh demo on netlify so you can look at this same site uh here's the github repo we've mostly been doing just kind of a curtsy like visual check so we've been looking at things like color contrast um so the web aim color contrast checkers can the main other tool that we've looked at but and i've been asking Ben to come back on again because i think realizing and seeing these is going to be like being aware of it is like the biggest part of like knowing the change and then hopefully Ben will come back on and like then we can go through and see how we start doing the changes yeah i think that is like a big like two-piece part of comprehending and then actually changing yes okay so here's what i want to do next because we've kind of looked at a few things here and there right but um we i have alluded a couple times to there are accessibility defects that you literally cannot see on this page right um and so i want to help you basically figure out uh like like get to the point where uh you can start to discover more of these things and so i'm going to recommend you and solve a browser extension uh this is called axe dev tools that's axe as in like a lumberjack tool um and i will get you um there's a link in the chat but if you go to like the chrome web store um oh actually yeah you yeah i think this is there we go yep all right and you're just going to click that add the chrome button so this is um by a web accessibility resource called dq systems dq is phenomenal um they they have a great website where they provide a lot of accessibility information um i would trust them with my life when it comes to accessibility stuff and so what axe does this is a browser extension that will let you scan a page and it will it will give you a report of automatically surfacedable accessibility issues that won't be every issue that can't be because you know you can't magically check everything with a computer um yeah so we are going to have to yep yeah there we go uh and so yeah let's go ahead and hit scan all of my page oh hello oh oh can you restart your browser hopefully this isn't the browser that has stream yard open i have it open in a different tub but please hold i can do something that's give me a second i'm gonna go back to uh uh some that i'll change some things around i just have no idea what i have open and my other browsers yeah we just need like i think a new browser window um yeah and if you want i can actually also do this on my end if you do yes you can you can teach us and let me start sharing my screen here um just so sec got it allow okay so hopefully we i think at this point we've now got some recursion yeah all right um yeah so i'm on the recipe site and here's what i'm going to do is i'm going to open up my dead tools oh that has opened up over here so i'm going to now run this is the same extension you've got i'm going to click scan all of my page and this is going to again come up with the automatically surfacedable accessibility issues that won't be every issue but it can tell you for instance hey this image is missing alt text it can't tell you whether that alt text is good or accurate right um so there's still a usability concerns here but um as you can see we may actually rearrange this so we can see everything better as you can see it tells me like oh on the the homepage we have 44 issues let me maybe put these side by side here we go so we have 44 issues that it's come up with um so 16 of those are color contrast issues um then there's one called like HTML element must have a Lang attribute well i wonder what that's about um so if i scroll down here it'll actually give me some information of like oh here's your element right here's how you find this but then if i keep looking um there'll be this link here that says more info i really like clicking this link because a lot of times i find that in accessibility i don't know why something's a problem right um it's like there might be a requirement for something my automatic tool might come up with something right but like i don't know why this is an issue why why does it matter that my HTML element must have a Lang attribute right so i click this page and it takes me to a page that dq has about this exact issue um i also send that link in the chat here but um yeah so what this is the Lang attribute let's specify the document language um for you know our purposes we'll want Lang equals en because this is an uh an english language site and then i could scroll down here and it'll tell me why it matters and broadly speaking it matters because assistive technology uh like streamers in particular want to know how to use like want want to know how to parse our page right and so they'll want to know like what pronunciation packs do i need to load and stuff like that um and so i like looking at this because this tells me a lot about like who needs this and why is this a requirement that can give me a good sense of how to fix it too right because i might look at this and go well okay i recognize that the automated tool is giving me this issue but the real problem is actually something with my design for instance right i could change my design instead of going specifically with the fix that's being suggested does that kind of make sense it does uh something that's coming to mind for me is there are a lot of small businesses and things that would be open to changing these but they're using things like square space or wicks or those type of things and uh that is something i'm going to be digging into because i just looked at my podcast website and just on the homepage it has 14 errors or 14 things that can be changed um or excuse me 12 12 yay um and i really like how it says critical serious moderate and minor and i'm curious how with a web builder what is going to allow us to change things around and be able to you know make it more accessible so that is something that i'm actually going to do tomorrow because i don't have anybody on the show and it's it's definitely interesting that there's so many of these options and yet i will say for myself and i think this is something that is also changing the practices that each of us do of it is really hard for me to um just like get captions going and then post them on the youtube video and also make it accessible in text and like a transcript or something like that and it's something that i'm going to challenge myself to do is a video slash text of best practices to do that so then you know i'm gonna end up hitting you up to let me know from this stuff just as uh something that has content creators that we can be more conscious about absolutely um yeah so obviously like again this has been such a broad introduction and there's so many rabbit holes we could go down right we haven't wait like we've maybe even just like barely just been able to scratch the surface and so we'll definitely do more streams and i can show you more things um but probably speaking again we're building websites for people we're building websites that people need to use an hour job our fundamental job no matter what tooling or structure or frameworks or whatever no matter what we're using our job is building interfaces that people can use and that includes disabled people because we do have disabled users they're already using our sites um and so uh probably speaking every once in a while just try to put yourself in the shoes of you know someone who has a different disability and then figure out like if I were this person what is something that I might uh that might be a barrier for me right and and then don't just take your guesses um for it like like don't just take your own word for it right um see if you can seek out blog posts and tweets from people who do have those disabilities and see how they describe their web experience because it's almost definitely different from how you'd anticipate but um yeah look for uh yes but like look for ways to um discover more so i mentioned the web content accessibility guidelines both are the industry and legal standard for web accessibility on our sites okay and uh in fact um I will drop a link in the chat to that document and it's one of the things that's just kind of in front to do uh every once in a while if you're a nerd like me uh is uh here we go it's just kind of scroll down this page and find a requirement um maybe next time we talk about like how to read wikag maybe that's something that we do um I also wanted to get to like screen readers stuff we didn't even get close to that but like that's that's really fine um kind of read through this and and just be like hey if something surprises you right where you're like huh I would never have thought of that why is the case read more if you can figure out why it's an accessibility issue and see what you can do to improve that on your own site and thank you for that and thank you for getting us through the first step of you know looking into this and this is something that we should all look into early on and thank you everyone for joining uh what up be one mind uh and we're about to end so end up to get to yeah hit us up with questions this will be on twitch and on youtube and let us know and we will have been on again yeah looking forward to bye oh bye
No i'm um oh uh yeah i can work on that Anthony broadly speaking so we're looking at a and i'm hosting this uh demo on netlify so you can look at this same site uh here's the github repo we've mostly
