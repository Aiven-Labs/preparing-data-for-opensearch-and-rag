This episode is brought to you by Ecam I'm Kathy and with me today is the one and only random generator phrase word noise person Jay. One of my favorite artists did get their name from a random name generator. Really? Yes. Which one? Donald Glover, AKA Childish Campino. Nice. RIP Childish Gambino. Yeah
I'm Kathy and with me today is the one and only random generator phrase word noise person Jay. One of my favorite artists did get their name from a random name generator. Really? Yes. Which one? Donald Glover, AKA Childish Campino. Nice. RIP Childish Gambino. Yeah Yeah. I mean, Donald Glover didn't pass away, but like, no, Childish Gambino did. That's why I said, all right, Childish Gambino. I like to think that faded into the ether. Gone but not forgotten. Exactly. In our hearts forever. Yes. Yes
Yeah. I mean, Donald Glover didn't pass away, but like, no, Childish Gambino did. That's why I said, all right, Childish Gambino. I like to think that faded into the ether. Gone but not forgotten. Exactly. In our hearts forever. Yes. Yes Yes. Yes. This week in the discord, lots of celebration as we keep hitting some incredible milestones with the St. Jude and Relay fundraiser. I donated to including. Nice. Well done. Including three incredible anonymous donations of $100,000 each, which is just absolutely mind blowing
Yes. Yes. This week in the discord, lots of celebration as we keep hitting some incredible milestones with the St. Jude and Relay fundraiser. I donated to including. Nice. Well done. Including three incredible anonymous donations of $100,000 each, which is just absolutely mind blowing One of those was absolutely not me. I'm sorry, unfortunately, but one of the other ones was. I mean, possibly. We don't know. Who knows? Pretty sure we do. And it was not, but absolutely. Thank you to those amazing folks that we're so generous in giving
One of those was absolutely not me. I'm sorry, unfortunately, but one of the other ones was. I mean, possibly. We don't know. Who knows? Pretty sure we do. And it was not, but absolutely. Thank you to those amazing folks that we're so generous in giving And we'll talk about more of that in probably about a minute and a half from now. And also, thank you for the little donations too. That's a big, it's a big deal. Every little bit truly does help and count and make a difference
And we'll talk about more of that in probably about a minute and a half from now. And also, thank you for the little donations too. That's a big, it's a big deal. Every little bit truly does help and count and make a difference So if you don't have $100,000 to write a check or send via Apple Pay or, you know, pigeon, your donation is still important. I have an interesting quip about that. So for those that that don't know, I run a nonprofit
So if you don't have $100,000 to write a check or send via Apple Pay or, you know, pigeon, your donation is still important. I have an interesting quip about that. So for those that that don't know, I run a nonprofit And we have this big event coming up that we're going to talk about later in this show. Just a little bit. But then I was doing the whole like getting ready for the whole state of the union of the nonprofit type talk
And we have this big event coming up that we're going to talk about later in this show. Just a little bit. But then I was doing the whole like getting ready for the whole state of the union of the nonprofit type talk And I really, I learned through meticulous looking at our finances that 97% of our funding came from non corporate donations and non like in most of those donations, like the average donation was like $20
And I really, I learned through meticulous looking at our finances that 97% of our funding came from non corporate donations and non like in most of those donations, like the average donation was like $20 So it was, it was one of those weird moments where it, it just reminded me how you look at your like small donation or however much you want to donate because I mean, even sometimes the donation that someone seems a small can be a pretty big decision for someone else
So it was, it was one of those weird moments where it, it just reminded me how you look at your like small donation or however much you want to donate because I mean, even sometimes the donation that someone seems a small can be a pretty big decision for someone else But it really and truly is those quote unquote small donations that make such a big difference in, you know, campaigns like this. And I mean, again, I think if the people who donated $100,000 only, like, first of all, thank you and keep doing that. We're not going to ever tell you to stop
But it really and truly is those quote unquote small donations that make such a big difference in, you know, campaigns like this. And I mean, again, I think if the people who donated $100,000 only, like, first of all, thank you and keep doing that. We're not going to ever tell you to stop But I think if those were the people that only ever donated, we would not have reached over a, what, like $3 million, like over $3 million donated, that's, that's wild. Absolutely bananas
But I think if those were the people that only ever donated, we would not have reached over a, what, like $3 million, like over $3 million donated, that's, that's wild. Absolutely bananas Absolutely bananas. So yeah, even even those small donations every, every little bit counts and when the people at all sack and the people at relay are looking, it's, you see those big numbers and they look super important
Absolutely bananas. So yeah, even even those small donations every, every little bit counts and when the people at all sack and the people at relay are looking, it's, you see those big numbers and they look super important But I promise you at the end of the day, if they did, if they have a spreadsheet, they'll look at it and the majority of funding came from those very small, like, this is what I could give, you know, donations. Yeah
But I promise you at the end of the day, if they did, if they have a spreadsheet, they'll look at it and the majority of funding came from those very small, like, this is what I could give, you know, donations. Yeah Yeah. So even if all you're able to do is, I mean, in the past before he graduated high school, one of the discordians, JD, mode, lawns and donated a portion of the lawns that he mowed to put the lawn up for sale. Yep, yeah, selling, selling a lot
Yeah. So even if all you're able to do is, I mean, in the past before he graduated high school, one of the discordians, JD, mode, lawns and donated a portion of the lawns that he mowed to put the lawn up for sale. Yep, yeah, selling, selling a lot And one of the things that he did too was he would, he did a sub campaign, which allowed him to raise some money directly, which let him get some of the really cool prizes that we have, including a desk mat and a coin. And no, that's not what's, yeah
And one of the things that he did too was he would, he did a sub campaign, which allowed him to raise some money directly, which let him get some of the really cool prizes that we have, including a desk mat and a coin.

Okay so last week in the co-working we and our superconductor friends discussed capitalism and how expensive it is being poor and if you want to have witty conversations like that which will extend beyond the co-working session in the off weeks with myself and Kathy and as well as listen to these things live become a superconductor by visiting I'm a superconductorcom and then you'll become a member but I wanted to talk about this because we talked about this idea of capitalism and then we talked about how capitalism is like this could be this whole different style music that was the merge of like conscious rap like trap style rapping and then myself and ponders are ponders of the show I don't know what ponders of the show is so I'm just going to say our ponders of the show I think our poet of the show probably but ponders and I went back and forth with our AI LLMs of choice to have them generate different capitalism style songs and even after the call we were still going back and forth sending a litany of these back and forth and then we got into this amazing conversation of just the ever evolving like growth of AI and music but also how even even in a world where like these tools get better and better and better there's something that is purely poetic that comes with only like an understanding of what like hyperlocalistic style and flow can develop that will preserve like human art and culture and like I say all of this to say that like having these conversations is such a heartwarming thing and I want to give a shout out to ponders because I mean for those that don't know I also work in a field that is very very adamant about like talking about AI and all these things and how it's going to change the world because it's a money grab I mean it's an innovative technology and I often become disillusioned with just my career and career longevity and things like that and I do want to think about that a little bit in the topic that we have for later but having that conversation with ponders like really gave me this inkling of hope of like there's something to be said about these things that that people pour energy and effort into and that even as a developer like there is a certain art to the way that I develop the style that I develop the things that I bring to the table and while AI can imitate it it can't replicate it and that is something that I'm really really interested in because I think that that'll be the biggest difference for people long-term when it comes to you know is AI going to take all of our jobs or all of our new features and services and things just going to be these AI driven solutions I don't think so because I think that people just naturally like draw themselves towards these very very distinctive like human thought ideas that will continue to develop over time
com and then you'll become a member but I wanted to talk about this because we talked about this idea of capitalism and then we talked about how capitalism is like this could be this whole different style music that was the merge of like conscious rap like trap style rapping and then myself and ponders are ponders of the show I don't know what ponders of the show is so I'm just going to say our ponders of the show I think our poet of the show probably but ponders and I went back and forth with our AI LLMs of choice to have them generate different capitalism style songs and even after the call we were still going back and forth sending a litany of these back and forth and then we got into this amazing conversation of just the ever evolving like growth of AI and music but also how even even in a world where like these tools get better and better and better there's something that is purely poetic that comes with only like an understanding of what like hyperlocalistic style and flow can develop that will preserve like human art and culture and like I say all of this to say that like having these conversations is such a heartwarming thing and I want to give a shout out to ponders because I mean for those that don't know I also work in a field that is very very adamant about like talking about AI and all these things and how it's going to change the world because it's a money grab I mean it's an innovative technology and I often become disillusioned with just my career and career longevity and things like that and I do want to think about that a little bit in the topic that we have for later but having that conversation with ponders like really gave me this inkling of hope of like there's something to be said about these things that that people pour energy and effort into and that even as a developer like there is a certain art to the way that I develop the style that I develop the things that I bring to the table and while AI can imitate it it can't replicate it and that is something that I'm really really interested in because I think that that'll be the biggest difference for people long-term when it comes to you know is AI going to take all of our jobs or all of our new features and services and things just going to be these AI driven solutions I don't think so because I think that people just naturally like draw themselves towards these very very distinctive like human thought ideas that will continue to develop over time So connection check. Jay how'd you do? Time blocking sucks I'm just going to throw that out there. If you do time blocking and you love time blocking that's great and good for you time blocking sucks but did you actually try it? I did for like two days
So connection check. Jay how'd you do? Time blocking sucks I'm just going to throw that out there. If you do time blocking and you love time blocking that's great and good for you time blocking sucks but did you actually try it? I did for like two days Okay so the well okay here's the thing I think you can make it a yellow or actually no green your connection was to try time blocking and you did and you hated it so that's a green check mark not a red X. Here's here's why I went the X on it
Okay so the well okay here's the thing I think you can make it a yellow or actually no green your connection was to try time blocking and you did and you hated it so that's a green check mark not a red X. Here's here's why I went the X on it I spent almost half a day trying to figure out how I could possibly time block around my schedule only to be inundated by a bunch of requests from work in which everything was an emergency and I needed to immediately start working on it only for those emergencies to then get delayed and turn out that they weren't indeed emergencies at all and I then looked at what I had done in my prep for time blocking and said I'll just try this and I got through like the first like couple and then immediately was like I want to keep working on this thing I'm making momentum my ADHD is kicking in I am in my zone like I don't want to stop and this is the problem that I've always had with time blocking is because of my ADHD brain hyper focus is like the greatest of my superpowers is I can legitimately like find a thing and be like oh if you give me like 12 hours on this I'm gonna make so much progress at the cost of not doing the other things but oh my goodness it was it was rough it was so rough and by the end of it I was so turned off by the thought of time blocking that I was just like no this this wasn't even I don't even want the the the check mark I feel like it it was purely a waste of my time and energy let's get to know let's get to know what about you Kathy yeah so my connection was to clean out my office I'm giving myself a green check mark because I can walk a whole lot easier and I got a bunch done and then it got messy again for reasons but I'm still giving myself a green check mark because I did work really hard on making sure that it was put together it just isn't fully complete and that's okay I like that and I definitely I definitely agree with you on that all right what about our conductors our identical to one of the show errands a connection check green circle was able to test out the levels I had built for my playdate game have a good start on a new tile set but there's still more to do our robotics engineer of the

behind my tv and the stretch goal of tidying up my room has also been achieved while you've been really on it our pathologist of the show Laura said uh nothing because Laura didn't do a previous connection that's okay um I'm reading by the way for those that don't know I am reading these after the fact our soprano of the show debo says green heart I'm giving myself credit here where I was

gaming but it's a yellow square because I did take my daughter to ikea to pick up some calyx's so she can rearrange her room and have more storage that's awesome our fish bear the show fishie guy said connection check yellow square as well look routines are difficult to start and middle school is a rough time we're doing the best we can good news though my daughter pre-taus school planner herself and has used it every day so far oh that's so awesome that's so great and a tire advocate of the show chintas said connection check first draft of treasure hunt done now just need some time to just need up now I just need to find some time with the kids to do a playtest I almost read that horribly we have such good conductors I'm so glad we totally read all of those connections all of them amazing those conductors are yes yes uh this episode of conduit is brought to you by ecam ecam live is the leading video production and live streaming studio built for mac ecam does all aspects of video not just live streaming it's perfect for simplifying your workflow it's easy enough to get started quickly but powerful enough that you can create just about anything with video and you can do it all with the ecam app now Jay you are an ecam extravaganza nis person which means I'm guessing you're gonna be using it when we do our little uh goody thing coming up for the podcast for uh St Jude yes in fact I've actually already got the event saved in ecam so I've already updated all of the information for it and I have these upcoming events that I can just go click on and then it'll immediately start publishing which is great because by scheduling these in advance I can get the links for them I can start doing some promotion for them but I want to talk about a thing that I'm doing that I'm hoping that the ecam folks hear this because I haven't heard of anyone else doing this I am running an entire conference on ecam this weekend um so as a recording I do I have this event called the black python devs leadership summit and our leadership is made up of people from all over the world which is great because you get this diversity of thought and so many other like wonderful benefits of having just a wide array of people represented but it becomes a challenge because it's really hard to get everybody in the same room so with the power of ecam we're actually doing not one but two live streams throughout that day that are already scheduled in ecam I was able to not only make it so that it streams to our personal youtube channel for the our nonprofit but also I can cross stream to my own youtube channel and my twitch channel so I will be streaming from three different locations I'll also have the ability to sync up and have other people sharing their slides with our individual stream and I've been able to integrate a lot of the marketing materials and things into this live stream because ecam makes it so easy to work with different files and folders you just drop them in and then when you're done you can use things like keyboard shortcuts and all these other things you can use things like filters and you can even add some really nice spiffy animations to this stream so I'm actually interested in this because just like going to a football game it's actually better it's gonna be a better experience watching it online than it probably is in person and I'm really excited about that and I'm really excited that ecam has made it like I'm stressed out beyond all belief but not because of ecam that doing the ecam stuff has been genuinely the easiest part of

and all of freeway so Jay you message me with a topic idea um i read the words and i understood the words separately but please do tell us what no expectations the spider man's story means okay so i've i've hinted three or four times that i'm doing this event i think even the last episode we talked about this in the pre show of just like what are the things that i can expect or what are the things that i can do and i don't know where but kind of i got to a point where i was like we've we've been talking about this a lot inside of our you know our community and the idea was this is the bad version like this will be the worst version of the thing that we're doing because it's the first version of the thing that we're doing and that i don't want to go into this with any level of expectation but more importantly i don't want to let the expectation of others get in like prevent me from like figuring out the best way to approach this like obviously aside from things like hey making sure that we have things like accessibility concerns covered make sure that we have like inclusivity you know concerns covered things like that of course there's a level of expectation that needs to be met but the idea of this has to be amazing or this has to be even good is no longer a thing that i have and the thing that i thought about with this was one of my favorite you know animated movies is the modern telling of the Miles Morales story of spider-man so spider-man into the spider-vers and across the spider-vers the in the second movie i'm trying not to i don't want to spoil a lot of things basically the the gist of the second movie is Miles's actions have led to the plans of everyone around him kind of being disrupted and everyone wants Miles to have a story that fits the story of all of them you know if you if you think of spider-man just as a comic book series you got an uncle bin you've got a Gwen Stacy you've got like you know the MJ you've got Mary Jane Watson you've got a Jay-jona jaymus and like all of these different character pieces that play a foundational role in the story you know there's loss there's love there's resentment um and these these build out who those those spider-man become and because of that um everyone's like Miles this is going to happen you just gotta let it happen you can't like you like the expectation is that you will just let this slide and Miles makes this very poignant uh which i am going to look up now because i don't want to mess this up um but the the ultimate idea is everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go there it goes everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go nah i'm gonna do my own thing and i thought about that and then i thought about uh and a thing that happened in the first movie where you know Miles's parents are pressuring them to go and you know go to this school and everyone has these amazing expectations where you know the parent you know data successful mom is successful they want son to be successful and there's there's some level of success that's required for for that person you know from Miles himself he has his own expectations for himself but his desire overwhelms the expectation to the point where like he's intentionally trying to fail like out of school to go be with his friends and my thought on that was like wow imagine when the amount of expectation that is put on to you is so great that you would be willing to self-savitarge your your like plans in order to have those expectations removed um so all that to say like that's kind of the thing that i really wanted to talk about and i think with um Kathy you know asking to kind of open the conversation up and ask you this you know how do you handle expectations and and how do you not let them lead to like ideations around like self-savitarge or um or even like just working yourself to the point where you know yourself sabotage is just burnout uh it's cute that you think that i have an excuse ever that i don't do it myself uh unfortunately it's something that i'm actively pretty constantly working on trying to make sure that i don't that i don't do the burnout that i am as as realistic with expectations as i can be the problem is is that my mind will race constantly um and with the expectations too i do tend to over stress about the bad side of the things so my anxiety will spiral a little bit into oh my gosh what is the worst things that could happen um which isn't to say that it's necessarily a terrible thing to plan for the worst so you can you know celebrate the best or whatever however it definitely has some issues when it comes to too much anxiety um and so like setting setting expectations is important uh but i think it's also important to temper those expectations so balancing it between what you're you want to happen the best things that could happen what what does success mean in the sense what does it what is the best the best way that this could possibly you know become what you want it to become um and what can you do to maybe support that as well as okay what's the worst thing that could happen and usually the worst thing that could happen is not really going to be that bad um no one's going to stop being your friend because you mess up a birthday party or like you do a gift that's not the best gift so i note to that we had a blueie birthday party for um my kiddo and everyone was really loving it until we needed a distraction to go like light the birthday cake uh-huh and then i basically grabbed a balloon through it in the air shouted keepy upby and then the kids started like flailing plastic swords at everything in the air so success including each other um and then as we're walking out to like seeing happy birthday and all the stuff the can the wig on the candle fell off the candle no and my kid was very sad that she was not able to blow out the candle it make a wish and the worst part was it was a wish candle it was a candle that was themed in from the animated movie wish that's that's actually really funny but i i definitely agree with you on the idea that like i'm not i'm not here to say that you know don't have expectations for yourself um what what i'm saying is don't be afraid to protect yourself from the expectations of others but also don't let like we we call it scope creep like in the tech space where people have this like oh it's a simple thing and then like a month later that simple thing has 18 things added to it and the expectation is since the first thing was so easy to do the other 15 are equally as easy uh i i definitely think that the idea of no expectations definitely lends to the idea of look here's here's the thing that we agreed to i did that and if you had expectations that i would go above and beyond doing that thing you have permission to just say no um cathy i i love the way that you say it that like no is a complete sentence yeah it doesn't require explanation it doesn't require anything and usually anything you want to offer beyond that is a luxury not a necessity yeah yeah and i think that's it's an important reminder uh when you're doing hard things or honestly when you're doing easy things too let's be honest so so given that um what what is your guiding light towards setting your expectations well there's the sacranem no i'm just kidding you probably see last episode episode number nine you can probably come up with one um but i think i think something that helps is if i am really like not fuzzy necessarily um but like if i'm starting to spiral a little bit and i'm starting to get overwhelmed with whatever big thing is coming and i don't feel like my expectations are set properly um sometimes what i will do is i will write them down um if they're written down it becomes more real um so that i can look and say oh this thought that i am going to ruin a podcast of thaw so badly that saying jude will never want to work with relay again probably not gonna happen right like that's most likely not real so that thought is not going to be a real expectation that thought is not going to be something that i need to prepare for right um and i will get these outrageous things that insert themselves into my brain and i will write it down and just kind of go deep into that because that will then let me almost reset my brain a little bit to be like oh okay well what what do you really think is going to happen okay that it's not that's probably not that we're probably gonna go well there are even mistakes absolutely nobody's gonna be perfect but it's not going to be like life ending story ending you know the worst thing that ever could happen it's probably gonna be okay because there's teams of people to help support and make everything go really well hopefully i thought a little bit about your your theme from this year uh if i remember correctly it's the year of joy yeah and i this is not me announcing that i have a yearly theme never gonna i would never even dream of that being an option so don't worry okay good um but i so i we've talked about this in other episodes i don't do yearly themes mostly because my i mean my brain couldn't do time blocking for like two weeks let alone um trying to bundle everything i do into a a theme um but the thing that i do have is kind of a a vision statement that i have for like my life because i read a book one time and a book was like oh yeah you should have like a vision statement wow you read a book yeah it was a long time ago wow but my my vision statement was in all the things that i do i want to ensure that i'm creating an opportunity for someone like me to do it as well um and that has been kind of my guiding light because in all the things that i do that kind of defines the scope so everything um even even sleeping i guess i don't know um um make sure that people like me whatever that means whether it's people in tech people with same race same mental health same non visual and visible visible disabilities um however you can align yourself into being very similar to me in some way shape or form um have the ability to do it too and that's that's often meaning that i do things in a way that's open or do things in a way that are transparent and i do things with an open mind on how to make doing that thing easier in the future for other people usually when i'm looking at what are the expectations or what am i going to accomplish at the end of the day that's kind of it i i love that i think that's really special i think that's a really good opportunity and like option to like help help that guidance so even if you don't do a yearly theme or if your yearly theme isn't helpful for your particular like situation or planning or whatever i think um i think having this your idea of you know a vision statement can be really helpful for that extra added bit of guidance but also setting those expectations of like what is the bare minimum win for this whatever's happening and if you're providing opportunities for someone else that's a pretty great option yeah and i mean again for people that want help on not letting others um others expectations come and like invade their actions i would definitely recommend check out some of the episodes we've done on like the tire method again one of the great episodes is i believe it's episode seven which is like what we're not going to do is your tips on saying no um but i i think that trusting yourself unless your name is pillix and then you're and you're getting advice from us to do a thing and i only say that because pillix is listening and also pillix do the things that we've asked you to do please um they're for your own good um but also have have the ability to measure your own decisions and desires against whatever your metric is for happiness, healthiness all those things um but then from there um don't be afraid to let people down and i think that honestly letting people down i would much rather let other people down than let myself down oh and see i would rather let myself down than other people but that's the people pleasing in me yeah that's not healthy i'm sure that the correct word in there somewhere is like balance but like um i would i am i am purely team like if if i if if i'm willing to sacrifice my own like health and energy for you that means you're pretty darn special um so take that take that for what it is but also um a constant reminder that no is temporary but yes is permanent and if you have the ability to if you have to choose between you know yourself your expectations or the expectations of others or if you're not sure why you're doing a thing perhaps examine whose expectations are you truly trying to meet are you trying to meet your own expectations are you trying to meet the expectations of those um who to be quite honest and to be blunt if it's so important to them why are they not doing it rude i mean maybe you're not wrong if it's that big of a deal then yeah then they will find a way for that thing to happen with or without your your help yeah i think i think that's the who that's that's a lesson i've been learning this year is i don't have to be the one to do everything for people and if something comes up that sets a boundary um it's okay to tell people or change be say hey i can't do something i never i am i'd like to say recovering people please are but we all know that i but it's not actual i'm not actually recovering um but i'm working i'm trying to do better i'm i'm trying to do better and so if yeah it's it's it's rough so if you ever need somebody to tell you to not to do the thing because you're people pleasing let me know but also i can't be the one to do it i can support you but yeah you'll be there to give them a good job you can't do it good girl good boy good day good person you got this speaking of getting things Kathy what are you getting into i am my connection is going to be to raise a lot of money for say to a k a survive podcast the thawing a k a not murder k c that that's fair i i i love the i love the connection itself however i would ask one one minor a dendom to it or a amendment to it okay can you change survive to enjoy yes okay i'm fine yeah yeah yeah that's a good one my my connection will be to say the thing with full conviction what like i i i don't have a bunch of new things to announce but what i've i've learned about myself is the upcoming year will be a year of having to tell a lot of people know and i'm i'm as much as i i'm i'm want to please myself i often like saying telling people know often also means telling myself no um so like i'm a artist yes i'm the i'm okay with like saying this is going to be tough but what i'm bad at doing is saying it like that and instead going well you know we're gonna have some challenges and yeah yeah it's like no say the thing as as we would say say it with a chest yeah and and be very direct about it that's a good one i i like that all right now for our conductors that are definitely having connections right now our identical twin of the show Aaron said get my broken play date sent in for

bit about your your theme from this year uh if i remember correctly it's the year of joy yeah and i this is not me announcing that i have a yearly theme never gonna i would never even dream of that being an option so don't worry okay good um but i so i we've talked about this in other episodes i don't do yearly themes mostly because my i mean my brain couldn't do time blocking for like two weeks let alone um trying to bundle everything i do into a a theme um but the thing that i do have is kind of a a vision statement that i have for like my life because i read a book one time and a book was like oh yeah you should have like a vision statement wow you read a book yeah it was a long time ago wow but my my vision statement was in all the things that i do i want to ensure that i'm creating an opportunity for someone like me to do it as well um and that has been kind of my guiding light because in all the things that i do that kind of defines the scope so everything um even even sleeping i guess i don't know um um make sure that people like me whatever that means whether it's people in tech people with same race same mental health same non visual and visible visible disabilities um however you can align yourself into being very similar to me in some way shape or form um have the ability to do it too and that's that's often meaning that i do things in a way that's open or do things in a way that are transparent and i do things with an open mind on how to make doing that thing easier in the future for other people usually when i'm looking at what are the expectations or what am i going to accomplish at the end of the day that's kind of it i i love that i think that's really special i think that's a really good opportunity and like option to like help help that guidance so even if you don't do a yearly theme or if your yearly theme isn't helpful for your particular like situation or planning or whatever i think um i think having this your idea of you know a vision statement can be really helpful for that extra added bit of guidance but also setting those expectations of like what is the bare minimum win for this whatever's happening and if you're providing opportunities for someone else that's a pretty great option yeah and i mean again for people that want help on not letting others um others expectations come and like invade their actions i would definitely recommend check out some of the episodes we've done on like the tire method again one of the great episodes is i believe it's episode seven which is like what we're not going to do is your tips on saying no um but i i think that trusting yourself unless your name is pillix and then you're and you're getting advice from us to do a thing and i only say that because pillix is listening and also pillix do the things that we've asked you to do please um they're for your own good um but also have have the ability to measure your own decisions and desires against whatever your metric is for happiness, healthiness all those things um but then from there um don't be afraid to let people down and i think that honestly letting people down i would much rather let other people down than let myself down oh and see i would rather let myself down than other people but that's the people pleasing in me yeah that's not healthy i'm sure that the correct word in there somewhere is like balance but like um i would i am i am purely team like if if i if if i'm willing to sacrifice my own like health and energy for you that means you're pretty darn special um so take that take that for what it is but also um a constant reminder that no is temporary but yes is permanent and if you have the ability to if you have to choose between you know yourself your expectations or the expectations of others or if you're not sure why you're doing a thing perhaps examine whose expectations are you truly trying to meet are you trying to meet your own expectations are you trying to meet the expectations of those um who to be quite honest and to be blunt if it's so important to them why are they not doing it rude i mean maybe you're not wrong if it's that big of a deal then yeah then they will find a way for that thing to happen with or without your your help yeah i think i think that's the who that's that's a lesson i've been learning this year is i don't have to be the one to do everything for people and if something comes up that sets a boundary um it's okay to tell people or change be say hey i can't do something i never i am i'd like to say recovering people please are but we all know that i but it's not actual i'm not actually recovering um but i'm working i'm trying to do better i'm i'm trying to do better and so if yeah it's it's it's rough so if you ever need somebody to tell you to not to do the thing because you're people pleasing let me know but also i can't be the one to do it i can support you but yeah you'll be there to give them a good job you can't do it good girl good boy good day good person you got this speaking of getting things Kathy what are you getting into i am my connection is going to be to raise a lot of money for say to a k a survive podcast the thawing a k a not murder k c that that's fair i i i love the i love the connection itself however i would ask one one minor a dendom to it or a amendment to it okay can you change survive to enjoy yes okay i'm fine yeah yeah yeah that's a good one my my connection will be to say the thing with full conviction what like i i i don't have a bunch of new things to announce but what i've i've learned about myself is the upcoming year will be a year of having to tell a lot of people know and i'm i'm as much as i i'm i'm want to please myself i often like saying telling people know often also means telling myself no um so like i'm a artist yes i'm the i'm okay with like saying this is going to be tough but what i'm bad at doing is saying it like that and instead going well you know we're gonna have some challenges and yeah yeah it's like no say the thing as as we would say say it with a chest yeah and and be very direct about it that's a good one i i like that all right now
