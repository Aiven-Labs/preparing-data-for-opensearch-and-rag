From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that starts when it starts, and that's how it starts, because it started in the middle of boarding. This episode is brought to you by Marker.blog. I'm Jay. I will be your pilot and with me is the other person that will be your pilot, the wonderful Kathy Campbell. Hi, Kathy. Hello, Jay. The exits are forward and aft and check behind you because they may be behind you. I am clearly not a flight attendant. Put on your mask before you let other people put on your mask. I mean, wow. Kathy, what happened this week in the Discord? Oh my gosh. So just today, something very dramatic happened. And we in the hashtag break room channel, we discussed, well, other people had conversations about making coffee with something other than water. Orange juice was options, a variety of other things, including the fact that someone's coffee had tomato notes to it, which we learned is possibly because the beans were from Kenya. Kenya apparently has a taste of tomato. So that is something that I learned this week in the Discord. As someone who drinks a lot of coffee from the African continent, especially from Kenya and Ethiopia, I don't know if I've ever recognized tomato as a note, but I wouldn't not say that either. So who knows? Yeah. And then last week in the amazing Superconductor coworking session, we had an amazing talk about how bougie all of us are. It was it was hashtag privilege, hashtag sports, hashtag we need the suits to hurry up and get that private jet ready for us. Yes, please. But yeah, before we jump into this week's topic, a special one for the both of us. Shout out to go to my favorite baseball team as I will get to my connection later. So spoilers, I guess we went to go see my favorite baseball team, which is now my daughter's favorite baseball team. And we won because we're the best. And yeah, so yeah, shout out to them. Shout out to a great night at Petco Park. Are you going to say what your favorite baseball team? No, because I already got enough hatred from. I am an Atlanta Braves fan. Yes, name, yes, questionable decision making all around. They are still my favorite baseball team and have been for my entire life. What about you, Kathy? Yeah, my shout out goes to a panda of the show, James Thompson, for taking a task off of my plate that it didn't take much time. And it didn't take much energy to do, but it's something that I had had on my calendar to do since the 1st of April. Today is April 18th, just so you know. I clearly needed help. It probably didn't take very long. It just was adding people to a specific Slack channel and I mentally was blocked. And so James came in and saved the day. And now we can do the planning that we need to do. So thank you, James. So what you're saying is it just takes some time. Little girl, you're in the middle of the ride. Everything, everything will be just fine. Everything, everything will be all right. All right. Connection checks. What was your connection, Kathy? Zap. Zap. So my connection was to try and bring calm and peace to the studio dancers during our championships. I think we did a really good job. I had help with my roommate, other dance mom parent who was able to take care of my kid. And like I had to be there early both days for other teams to take their photos and stuff. And so this other mom took care of mini soup and like took them around to describe and discover the town. They got beads for hair. They bought books. They got treats, including very expensive drinking chocolate, like six dollars for an ounce. And of course, they loved it. For six dollars, you better love it. Yeah, right. Right. And it really helped them stay calm and collected, even though the solo that they performed was definitely not their best performance because the one thing that we did was forget to make them eat protein, like a protein boost beforehand or carbs, any of that. They hadn't eaten a whole lot. So their energy was really low. And out of 18 people, they still got sixth place. We were not expecting them to place at all because it was not their best performance. And so I'm so proud of how well that they did. And then their team got first in one of their dances, which was incredible. And I'm so proud of them for that. That is awesome. Congratulations to the team and great job, Kathy, for keeping them cool. My connection was to have a daddy daughter day or a day with my daughter. I should have modified this and said, like, my my wife is like invited to also join in on the festivities. It was just something out of the ordinary, something to get us out of out of the house, something to make memories and things like that. Again, we went to a baseball game. I've been really trying to keep up with baseball more this year, and I've been watching my favorite team like every day. Like, it's become like part of the ritual that I have of just part of my whole my whole day, day by day stuff. And they were in town. And since, you know, I'm going to be traveling soon or soon, I mean, tomorrow, it was like everything just kind of lined up to be like, oh, we're going to this game. And I guess for some other context, my daughter had been to a baseball game before, but she'd gone to a minor league game. I don't know if you for those that don't know, minor league baseball is probably one of the most fun experiences for kids because the audiences are a little small. But because of that, they do a lot more stuff to try to encourage people to come out to the ball the ballpark. So they wind up like doing like kids races on bases and they give out like prizes and stuff, and the mascots run around the stands and and hang out with the little ones. I think she was expecting that as well. Oh, no. A major league game with several thousand people there. That was not the case. She was like, it's very loud. We got her some headphones. And then after that, she had a great time still. But yeah, shout out again. Shout out to the team. We won. But yes, I did make sure that we had a special day out the whole family. We had seats right along the third baseline so you could see everything. It was absolutely amazing. And 10 out of 10 would park again. What about our conductors? Starting with our shark of the show, Chris, connection check. I restructured my task management system to accommodate the extra complexity associated with working on multiple projects across three time zones. That's incredible. I would love to hear some follow up and kind of what you did. Definitely not because I'm looking I need to change things up. But yes, that's also what I'm asking for, because I have. Who? It doesn't matter. That's not the thing. We're concentrating on you, Chris. Great job. Congratulations. I'm super proud of you. Our fish bear of the show, Fish Guy says I had two projects where I was waiting on someone else. One turns out I didn't need to do it all. So I'm taking the W. Hey, I like that. Sometimes sometimes you win by not participating. The other person got back sooner than I thought. But the project wrapped up when I wanted to anyway. So mostly green again, I think wins all around. Yeah, that sounds like a solid green to me. Our Oracle of the show, Soph says connection check. Yellow Heart, I wanted to meditate three times a week, but I only managed twice in total. But they were very nice meditation sessions on the beach. I think that gets double points. So I'm proud of you for giving yourself the yellow heart because you did. Like meditate, so that's awesome. I almost said meditation. No, that's not the right thing. No, no, it's not. Our mountain dweller of the show, Logang, says I missed posting it last week. Yellow Square by a couple of hours, but my connection was to get everything ready for electrical and plumbing inspections. That's right. We're on house house updates. I finished 86 out of 90 outlets and switches. Oh, and all the overhead lighting, but still have a sink in a toilet left. I'm pretty sure you're good. Like, it's OK if we got a little bit left. That's a lot and way to go getting all that stuff done. Plus, I think there's a very good chance that you do. You could do the last four before the show goes out two days from now. So that pressure on Logang. I know, I know. But I'm saying you could easily get that green checkmark. But looking at the mountains. That's true. That's very true. Distracted by the sunset. I get it. I get it. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron, says connection check. Green checkmark ran close to 22 kilometers since the last conduit episode. Thanks for the extra push. Well, thank you for giving us any sort of acknowledgment for your amazing connection. Great job. Our slot for the show on can you hey, on can you says connection check. Life pulled me aside for about check for us for months. I was going to say it's been it's been a while. Oh, that's right. We don't do that anymore because that person's a horrible person. Man, a lot of song references that I have to go and check on now. But I've caught back up with conduit. I think my last connection in January was to straighten up my home office and hobby space. And I did it. Hey, way to go. I love that. Though it's back to being cluttered up. Oh, no. I was painting such still green check for that long forgotten fortnight. That's OK. Way to go. And we're glad to have you back and glad to have you back on the train. Listen, you're a sloth. It's OK. Sometimes it takes a little bit longer. You only have three. Very happy that you're here. I mean, I think I don't think all sloths have three toes since there's one specifically called the three toad sloth. And I feel like that means that it would be different. But then they would have two toes. Well, I know, but I feel like they're. I listen. What I'm saying is I need to know how many toes a quote unquote normal sloth slash other sloth has that makes a breed of sloth a three toad sloth. I almost I almost so yeah. I'm going to send us send us some feedback. How many times the official sloth sloth? Has an official sloth of the show. We need this feedback. All right. Our nameless of the show, Robert says connection check. Green Circle went for walks, did not find ducks. Unfortunately, I'm sorry. The feud with USPS is finally, finally over with them. Now delivering the mail to my mailbox. Congratulations. We will cancel the parade practice then. Our trade enthusiast of the show, Relsie, says green multiple symbols. I began writing a daily book. I began writing daily to do list for me, a strong improvement from finding what to do. It's not consistent, but it's getting better. Hey, I you know, we're going to be talking about how some of our stuff is going to change up just because of where we are. So I think trying new things and seeing what works and letting that slowly progress over time is kind of the right way to go. Yes, agreed. Our panda of the show, James, says connection check. I have been relatively good at not stressing out too much and have read many books in the last two weeks. I have even booked a flight to distant shores for a top secret event. Top period secret period. Again, hey, suits, get this get the jet ready. Come on. Yeah, get the jet. Come on. Get the jet. And then our code monkey of the show, programmer says connection check. Yellow Square kind of sort of halfway stuck to the system. Got to do better. Hey, it's called progress and you've made it. Yes. And you just got to keep making it. And then you then you did better. There you go. That's how you do it. Progress for the pro grammar. Oh, no. Sponsor. This episode of Conduit is brought to you by micro.blog. Blogging is still the easiest way to share stuff on the web. And micro.blog is the easiest way to blog. Personal blogging is making a comeback thanks to all of the disruption in social media. So if you have always wanted to build your own place on the Internet to keep and share the stuff you love, micro.blog is for you. Micro.blog is the blog you can actually use because we've made it so easy to write short or long blog posts, share photos, keep a log of the books you read and even create your own podcast. But more than a place to post your stuff, it's also a friendly community of people with a wide range of interests who share and comment via micro.blog social timeline, which is managed by humans, not bots. It's the social network you can feel good about. And because micro.blog is open, you can use your own domain name, cross post to Twitter, Tumblr and Mastodon. You can also follow and be followed by Mastodon users directly with conversations threading across both micro.blog and Mastodon. And finally, you can share your RSS feed so anyone can follow you.

Go ahead and send us a message at relay.fm slash conduit slash feedback or put it in the discord and tag me and we might share your experience in a future show. I'm super excited for my sister, Jean, to come back from her amazing trip because we are going to set up my micro.blog. Not that I need extra help, but it's kind of an excuse to come and see her new place at the beach. So I'm super excited. So micro.blog hosting starts at five dollars per month.

Our thanks to micro.blog for their support of the show and all of Relay FM. And at the end of each ad read, we say thank you in a different language. And this week, we're saying thank you in Guarani. So a guy, Javette. Hey, Kathy, I would I would love to chat, but I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm getting on a plane. I'm doing some travel. So, yeah, do you got it for the next, like, week and a half? Well, funny, you say that because I also have some travel. So I hope I was hoping you could do it for the next week and a half. I mean, who's who's going to keep the show running with all this traveling? How how is the the unicorn blessing going to be well blessed? Especially because a fun fact, I'm going to see three out of four of my unicorns all together. Also, shout out that as the chat is like, I volunteer. Yay. So many great, great volunteers. But no, we're still here. Yeah. And in the last co-working session, all of our all of our bougie talk came from the acknowledgement that both of us are in unprecedented instances, traveling at the same time to different places. And they lined up pretty well. So because we're both really, really busy people and we do a bunch of wild things in our day to day with our jobby jobs and our hobby, Hobbs, and I don't think that's a thing. But I thought it would be kind of cool if we talked a little bit about how do we how do we keep the pace and how do we keep things going? Do we keep things going while we travel? And Kathy, I guess you can kick it off like, what are you planning on doing while not not an itinerary or anything? But what are you planning on doing to keep yourself or keep the momentum going while you're away? Yeah. So the nice thing is, is I have open communications with all of my clients. So they all know that I'm traveling. So I there's a couple of clients that I check emails for and I do some sort of like that client triage stuff. So I've let them know, hey, it's going to take like I'm only doing this like once or twice a day, depending on what day of the week it is. Like Friday, nobody, not many people email on a Friday. So I'm good with sending it out like only doing one day. But the the so the biggest thing is communication. I mean, honestly, that's the biggest part for any of this. But then also making sure. That you. Really are only doing the things that you need to do, if that makes sense. So I've narrowed it down. There's there's definitely things I'm not doing. And there's things that I know have to get done, you know, paying people for some reason, they think that's important, but yeah, but I'm planning that into my day. So because I'm going to a convention that I'm also kind of working, it's it's a delicate balance of like fitting things in where I can. And it just kind of takes extra planning, but I'm also planning on. Taking breaks and taking time with myself, but also since Mini Soup is going with me, spending time with them, too. Like this is a vacation of sorts. And it's all about balance, really. It's all about balance. Yeah, I was going to ask about that of, you know, there is the whole like, oh, let everybody know what you can do and what you won't be able to do and what, you know, what's happening, what's not happening. But also, how how are you when it comes to planning to vacation? Like, how do you are you are you the type that is like, I want to get there and I want to have all of my stuff planned out, even the fun bits or you like, get there and, you know, we'll see what we do. We do what we do. I it's mainly like. I plan the things that have to get done, because if it's not in my calendar, it's not going to happen, especially when you throw in time zone changes like that's we're crossing the entire United States. It's going to be a totally different time zone, totally different world, all of that. And it's it's important for me to plan and schedule the things that have to get done, even things that could be done at any time. I make sure to put it in my calendar so that I can see it and and make sure that it happens. Other than that, I'm very I'm pretty good, especially when there's people that I know very well and love. I'm pretty good at detaching. So some of these people I've known for more than 20 years. This is the convention in Atlanta that I went to last year. So these are friendships that I've had for a while, and I'm really excited to be able to hang out with them and visit with them and see them and hug them and just experience these people again. So that makes it easier for me to kind of decompress and discharge any sort of, oh, I should be working types of vibes. Other than that, I try not to be too. Over planning, because other people in my group that I'm traveling with don't necessarily like that as much. And it also doesn't leave as much room for the. Spontaneity that happens or variations that can occur. And so, you know, we're going to get there in the afternoon and we're planning on going to the hotel and checking in. And then we're going to go to the grocery store and get the groceries that we're going to need for the week and then after that we have dinner plans. But that's it. So we'll probably take a nap because it will be a very early morning. And and we have some lists of things that we want to do and ideas, but they aren't necessarily blocked in. And they're also if I don't do them, it's not the end of the world. And I think that's really helpful to have. Like almost three lists, you have the must do things, you have the would like to do, and then you have the if we have time things on the list. And so writing things down, putting it in, you know, a notes document or whatever. Like having that out of your brain and onto like a place to to research, to look up again can be really helpful because then you're not thinking about it too hard. So I highly recommend doing that. Yeah, it is interesting how. It's funny because like I feel like what we're doing is very similar. I'm also going to be working at a conference and unlike last year where I was there kind of working, but mostly just enjoying my time this year, I am like working, working. I am doing way more work than I probably have ever done at an event. And I'm in many ways planning that I'm going to be too tired to do as much as I normally would. And that. That has me a little worried. Again, this is one of those moments where a lot of us gather from people from all over the world, I'm going to see some of my friends from like Japan and Taiwan. And I'm going to see friends from just other sides of the US and parts of South America. I just confirmed like a good friend of mine from Brazil is coming up. So like there's like so many things that are like if I don't. Hang out with these people now, I probably won't be able to do it again until next year. And it's painful because I know that just some of those people I'm just not going to be able to hang out with. And I hope that we have a good friendship and acquaintanceship that that's understanding, but I also like it makes me sad. But yeah, enough about enough about that. Let's let's talk a little bit about the. Preparation, you talked about it a little bit of like, you know, communicating with all the people, all of your, you know, quote unquote, like stakeholders that like, hey, I'm traveling. Don't expect this kind of work from me. I will be doing a little bit of work, but it'll be like this type. How do you personally prepare yourself for travel? Like what's what's the secret soup packing sauce like? Yeah. So I have a an app that I use for my packing list and I use it not necessarily while I'm packing, but as like to put it on like a separate list, if that makes sense. So I'm very much an analog list writer. I love writing things down. It helps me read things. It helps me like process. But of course, you don't want to miss anything like plain and simple. That's not how it works. And so I like to still have the app. List available to make sure that I'm not missing things like meds or, you know, whatever. I can't even think of other things that would be important to me. Yes, really, I'm trying to remember. Don't say it. Don't say it. Keep the suspension. Well, I have to find it because I don't remember what it's called. I haven't looked at it so much. Suspense from the child. What is this? What is this? What is this app you speak? The app is called Beep. Yeah, we really love the app Beep. And yeah, if you want to know what the actual name is, yeah, they can they can sponsor us. I, oh my gosh, I, I do keep a list in an app that I, I kind of do like countdown list. It's kind of weird. And I'll have like T minus whenever to the event. And I'll have kind of a running. I'll like do like a running checklist, like a week out. That's like, OK, hey, I need to do this. I need to do this. I need to do this. And then I just have basically a gigantic list. And then I slowly work my way down that list afterwards. And. While it isn't good at remembering things, apparently like the milk or meds and things like that, it does at least make it so that on the day of and the day before, I'm not super like anxious about, oh, I need to go do this. I need to go do that. It's like, no, I know what I need to do. And I've planned it out like T minus five. You need to make sure that any purchases that you're going to have to do get, you know, that they're put in so that they have time to ship and get here on time. T minus four. You need to figure out what clothes you're taking. You don't have to pack them, but you need to figure it out. Like what you're going to take clothing wise. T minus three. You know, make sure that your projects are wrapped up and that you've presented them to the stakeholders, T minus two, like some other stuff. I don't even remember what I did on T minus two. I think I made an emergency trip to Best Buy and then T minus one. Don't do anything like try to mentally prepare yourself like. And by the way, as we're recording this, it is T minus one. And my plans work wise are two meetings that I have to attend. And like packing and that's it so that tomorrow morning everything is already packed, everything is ready to go. I don't have to do anything, but grab my stuff, which will be at the door ready for me and then head to the airport. So I have some bad news for people that wanted to know the app. It's called Simple Checklist, and apparently it doesn't exist anymore. So I was trying to get the link to come out and it doesn't work. So it was great because there's like with a single button, you can refresh and like remove everything from the list. And so it just is reused without having to like duplicate it or whatever. I'll try and see if I can find a replacement. But I my quick Google search does not. Seem helpful because they're trying to like, oh, use notion. And I'm like, this is not what I want, so I'm sorry, y'all. I wish I could help with the app, but maybe I'll find another one. I think there's also this this like beauty of. It's since we're going to be out of the boundaries of our normal space, we then reach for tools that are not part of our normal space as well. In your case, they're not part of anybody's space anymore because they're gone. But I, I do tend to use like digital productivity tools when I'm traveling, mostly because I leave my notebook here and I take my I take my my travel notebook, which is more like the hipster PDA for those that know, know, but it it absolutely keeps me like. If I try to think how I normally would, I would not be able to. Work effectively, because I'm not in that mindset, I'm not in that space, I'm usually running around frantically like, hey, I met this person, I need it. So it's just easier for me to be like J and travel mode operates this way. And I guess the one caveat to that is like if I'm traveling for an extremely long time and I actually have the ability to like set up a little office space for myself like I did last year when I was gone for like a month, then that's that's definitely like a different situation. But my normal travel of, you know, gone three to five days or something like that is all right, time to stop thinking like this and start thinking like this. And it is kind of a little, you know, in case of travel, pull the the travel productivity, you know, but or push the travel productivity button. I don't even use the same pens like things are completely different for me. Yeah, it's it's it's always important, I think, to make sure that you. Put some attention into that, so whether it's, I don't know, bringing a candle that you can light in the hotel that like is like, OK, this is my working time or like a specific playlist, pulling something that you have at home to tie it into, oh, this is work time can be helpful or, you know, taking the the pen that you do use at home to on your trip with you, something to connect your brain with working from home or like working from your home base. You know what I'm trying to say? I know it can be helpful or finding something that is not something normal that you could do to make it extra special, that still will help you work productively because you want to get stuff done as fast as you can so that you can go back to play. And for those interested, the pen that I use in travel is my Studio Neat Mark 1, which is a good little pen, but a very special relay one, the very special relay one. Yes, but I don't I don't use my fountain pens mostly because I'm terrified of ink getting everywhere inside. Gosh, me too. Yeah. However, however, this convention, we're having a pens swap. There's a bunch of us that are like big pen nerds. And so it's basically we're going to have a mini pen show. So I'm bringing a bunch of my old ink samples that I have. And yeah, I'm very excited. I'm very excited to see what happens. I was considering doing a pen pen meet and greet like, hey, let's all the fancy pen nerds that are going to be at the conference, bring your pens. However, again, I don't know. That's one of those things that you kind of got to plan in advance. And I'm doing enough stuff already. I don't think planning another thing would be the right idea. Yeah, yeah, that's a that's a smart. The only reason I'm doing this is because somebody else was planning it and I just jumped in. So it works out. I'm letting other people do things proud. Now, I know that this could probably be the next episode, but I feel like it's too easy if it is. But what is your strategy or what is your potential strategy for after the. Event happens and you get back home, like what's your process for getting reoriented into, I guess, normalcy? That's a great question. Ah, I don't have an answer. OK. And would love any suggestions. So I think for me, like one vacation again, I know for you, I think you're trying to do a little travel plus vacation. I am purely traveling and working. Also, see back a few episodes. This this is the Super Bowl event that I was talking about. This is literally the wrap up to all of the work that I've been putting in for the last couple of months. And I am tired. I even I even put that we had this big meeting at work and I was like, we have so much in store. I'm so tired. I mean, excited. And and so I think the first thing is like this isn't a vacation for me. This is work. And because of that, I'm now going to then take the vacation time that I probably should have been taking up. I don't remember. I've been sick. I don't think it was during the week that we recorded, but there was like an off week where like the stomach virus ran through the family and like I could not take the time off because it was like, I got to get this stuff done, we got to be ready, like this is that moment. And like now I'm like, OK, I need to catch up on all of this time off and relax and rest and then again go into the preseason of the next big event, which happens at in a couple of months, which for me is preparing to go to the next event, and luckily these events are more just for me. So I will have a little bit of time to have a, you know, have some fun and and hang out. But yeah, I think step one, get back, unpack, take a few days to just relax. And then after that, it's going to be sit down with myself and be like, OK, T minus whatever until the next event in June. What do we need to be focused on? What do we need to be thinking about and then start that process over? Yeah. Yeah, I, I think I'm looking at my calendar. I think I have. A month before I have to travel again and it's not on a plane, so that's helpful. I don't have to fly again. Till June, I think, which is again for work, travel plus fun, because that's how I roll. But I'm. I think because so last time I traveled like this. I didn't have as much going on as I have now, and I know that. This is going to be a very important event for my brain to see how my brain is going to do, so we'll see how it goes. We'll see what improvements I can make because I have, I think, two other flight trips this year that I'm going on, possibly another if I get invited to the red carpet again, like all of these things are coming into play. And I need to do a better job of it, so this is kind of like holding myself accountable because that's what we do here in Conduit is we give suggestions and support each other in hard things. So thank you for doing that here. Conduit, we care about accountability. We can't care. No, that's not. We also care about our connections for the next episode. And Kathy, what is your connection for the next episode? My connection is going to be to use this trip and return as a way to solidify a plan for planning. While traveling, that makes sense. Hmm. OK, OK, so. My connection, I'm going to not do the my connections. Have a good trip. I am going to come back and take a couple of days off and then give myself about four or five days before the next episode to create that timeline, that T minus whatever for the next event. And my hope is that that will allow me to have time to relax, but also understand that there's, you know, hey, we got back, we relax now, there's work to be done and get back into it relatively quickly. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. What about the conductors? All right. Shark of the show, Chris, his connection for the next conduit is to finish reorganizing his home office and time for the in-laws to visit from out of state. Office becomes the guest room when people come to visit. Oh, my goodness. That's like stressful. But I'm super excited for you to, you know, do your home office and get things done. So well done. Good luck. I mean, our fish bearer, the show fish guy says new connection, I need to be better about household tasks. Currently, I do things as I think of them or bump into them old school Roomba style. I like that. I'm going to make lists and explore some sort of priority scheme. Hmm. That's interesting. I want to learn more about that as I, too, have a very Roomba-esque like, hey, I stubbed my toe on this thing. I guess it's time to go clean. Yeah. So our oracle of the show, they say, sadly, I am no longer staying near a beach, but I'll try again to meditate three times a week in my boring house. Sounds to me like you need to like put a picture on your computer of a beach and play some relaxing beach music sounds. And then voila, you're totally at the beach, except not really. But good luck. Our mountain dweller of the show. Hey, what's his name again? Oh, yeah, Logang finished the flooring. Well, at least that's what he wants to do. That's the next connection is to finish the flooring bonus points for building the kitchen just, yeah, that's all. Yeah, that's it. Just building the kitchen and moving. But both of those rely on factors outside of their control. So, OK, I mean, take it easy, Superman. Our blue dragon of the show, Skylar says, new connection, get through final exams and be done for the summer. Yes, you're so close. Can't wait to hear how it goes. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron, says new connection, I need to make a follow up appointment for some blood work to check progress on me, hopefully improving on a health issue from last year. Yes, please be getting better. And do the things, get the appointments, all the stuff to make that a reality. Our sloth of the show, Onkhanous, next connection, I picked up some painting commissions in the last couple of weeks. In the next fortnight, I plan to finish the last three models for the first batch. Hopefully I can complete the second commission, too. But let's not get too ahead of myself. Please add to your connection to let us know how many toes sloths have. Thanks. Also, how much for a custom conduit compainting? So they paint models like the little the little like 40K. I stand I stand by what I said. If you can make a superconductor out of 40K model, then I want that model. Listen, stop getting him more work. We have a lot to do. We're already missing a new theme song from our guitarist of the show. Wow. You are being so harsh today. Let people live. OK, I guess. Our pathologist of the show, Laura's new connection, don't change systems for two weeks. Take steps to actually start addressing my back issues and find an ortho person and make an appointment. Yeah, there there's a lot to unpack there. I feel like one of those two of those, maybe three of those is a show all in itself. So I'm going to I'm going to leave it with just you can do it. And we can add it to this. Yeah. Oh, my gosh, brain just died. The name of the show, Robert, says new connection. I got a new real estate contract this week, so I need to get them ready to take pictures of their home and post the listing. Also, I've been wanting to listen to more music, so I started to go through the artists I follow on Spotify and listen to their top five songs by doing so. I have surprisingly found many new songs to listen to. I want to keep up this habit, this fortnight as it helps quiet my mind. What a great idea, especially to discover new music that you know that you will like. So that's fantastic. OK, our trade enthusiast of the show, Realzy says, keep up Duolingo and the daily notes and the train enthusiasm. I just made that last one up, but you can do it. I are a panda of the show, James New Connection. Try and not stress out about the impending Apple Developer Conference, which I am not attending, but the FOMO is rising. Yes. Deep breaths. No, it's going to be not like anything in the past. There won't be nearly as much FOMO. Spoiler, spoiler, spoiler. They're going to announce a new iOS version. What? Yes. Yes. So now you don't have to feel like you missed out because you now, you know, it's probably going to be something along the names of iOS something teen. And then and then, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then they're going to get on stage and they're going to say, we hope you enjoy it or we hope you like it or we're very excited. No, it's we can't wait to see what you're going to do with it. We can't wait to see what you're going to do with it. Also, they might talk about a watch OS thing and then they might even talk about an iPad OS thing. But that would we're not sure yet because, yeah, there's still a lot. And then they'll probably talk about a Mac OS thing. You just had the entire conference in less than a minute. Good job. And our code monkey of the show programmer says, take some me time every day for sanity and don't say yes to everything. Oh, I like that. Oh, yes. May I recommend an episode of the show that I don't remember which one, but talks about not saying yes. The opposite of that is no. The opposite of yes is indeed no.
