Hello, hello beautiful humans. Welcome to Teach Gen Tech. I'm Jen, your super 80-HT sparkly-gly host. Yay! And what is Teach Gen Tech? I stream anywhere from once to four times per week. That would be Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday About an hour and a half, learning about something that a guest wants to teach me. A lot of it has been Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, some APIs, some databases. We've had people on from like so many cool people. I just can't name them all. And join us on the journey
