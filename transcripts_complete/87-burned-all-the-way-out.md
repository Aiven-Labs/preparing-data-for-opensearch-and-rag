the phone listen listen more than talking um obviously I'm failing at that today um but I and I will talk about this maybe in a little bit more detail later on um I was impacted by kind of two things that worked that happened one was a round of layoffs in which I survived but half of my team did not um so now I am a part of a brand new org but then I'm also on officially this new quasi secret team at work um that is it imagined that they called the Avengers in and I really feel like I am playing Hawkeye in this like like that's that's where I like everyone else is doing these amazing things and I'm like hey I'm here too y'all it's good and like I said we'll talk more about that later but basically I was I was in a room with probably about collectively about 300 years of engineering experience with you know companies like Google and Microsoft and Meta and like Shopify and Spotify and like all these all these big corporate companies and we've been tasked to build this thing so my job was to basically be the public voice for this team I'm like their PR person but I'm also actively engaged on it and I'm doing technical things too which is that's a thing we'll talk about that later um but in that moment I did not need to be the loudest voice in the room I needed to be the little mouse with a fly on the wall that was just listening and soaking up all of this experience and I still am doing that so yeah I'll give myself two check marks as well because I feel like not only was I able to do that but I was also able to show that I belong and that I have a voice too and it is just as powerful if not that old though good for you what about our conductors yeah so eight in nope that's just kidding see this is this is why wait no no so we I was I was going down to this one thinking it was the right one but yeah you're right no we we have a lot of we have a lot of love messages basically from the previous episode um including uh thankfully needing to keep the spooky names one more conduit so Jay can enjoy them thanks ghost of ping our checklist enthusiasts of the show uh I'm I'm exciting uh I'm exciting wow you are exciting the thing that makes me so frustrated about this is that I cannot tell you who the checklist enthusiasts of the show is at the moment because it is just my brain is that broken no it's okay it's Mike obviously because in the spreadsheet that's how it's linked up but that the good part is as we have those links so we know who they are oh that means I gotta open up the other documents we need don't have to okay um also thank you to the identical twin of the show Aaron for talking you know for also mentioning that we had an amazing great guest this week um but our robotics engineer of the show Aiden said great episode uh it's another one my goodness another great episode so many great episodes um it felt really uncanny hearing about it getting darker in the morning while I was driving to work about two hours before sunrise oh yeah it's that time where we use we've been walking to school and we were like maybe we put the walking school on pause because it's like pitch black dark when we leave the house we even have like glow in the dark like things to try to be safe because we live near a main road and we have to walk down that main road but even then I was like in my car with the lights on I was like I don't like how darkness is yeah isn't it strange how fall and even more so than winter I think fall darkness feels thicker like it feels heavier and I don't know why I think it's something something noise pollution we're like um until like two or three in the morning people are still up people are still doing things you have clubs you have bars you have reason like gas stations will have big lights on and things like that but in the fall a lot of that stuff is set to turn off at like five or six in the morning but it doesn't get right outside until like seven thirty so there's still like a couple of hours in between there were like the lights are off all the noise all the light pollution is gone I think I said noise pollution earlier light pollution that's why I was really confused you know what I was gonna let you go I was gonna listen instead of talk oh I see what you did yeah yeah but our our lights here are our like timed to sunrise and sunset so if it's super dark in the middle of the day they're on yeah that's a smart yes I'm RT baby okay so maybe maybe now actual connection yes now we will actually go to the connections our artists of the show Carly says connection check green circle I worked on my portfolio for the portfolio review I'm not sure how good it is but that's what the review is for absolutely that's incredible well done I can go to our identical twin of the show Aaron who says connection check green circle so far it's been good getting away I have enjoyed seeing family and getting hikes in awesome thing our soprano of the show debauses connection check had a successful work week work trip to India my presentations went well and I seem to have avoided getting any waterborne or mosquito-borne illnesses well done oh mosquito-borne illnesses gave me like shivers yeah that's terrifying our fish bear the show fishy guys says connection check green heart family is in town and it's good the ah of the show ah oh it's it's Halloween week it's spooky oh red X I was supposed to clean out my closet and cold my clothes but I've been so busy the past couple weeks and I just genuinely forgot that was even on my list hey you know what that's okay that happens yep our robotics engineer of the show Aiden says green heart walks were taken naps were had nice I slept a lot this week our points enthusiasts of the show read says connection check white square forgot that I'd be out of town for half of the past fortnight so I'm giving myself a pass on not getting the yard work done absolutely that is the way to do it I love the idea of white being a listen this was not gonna happen this was the wrong connection to pick for this fortnight yeah I think that's a great idea wasn't even like I'm in Diveland it was like no mistakes were made and like yeah it's it's okay nothing bad absolutely our Canadian trivia card enthusiasts of the show Erica's pulled rolled a dice and then said connection check green heart I did yoga and played seat saver a bunch of times is that an actual game is it not speed speed saver well seated yeah I was wondering I was like wait a minute what is this I like she she explained it she explained it on the on the last connection I missed that part that's why yeah obviously you weren't paying attention but that's fine I got to the end of it and I was like well I need a nap and then but most importantly Erica held held herself under the three song limit so I wouldn't hurt myself I remember this because I was thinking about beat saver um cardiologist says not to stand up that's ooh yeah taken care of take care of yourself yes our checklist enthusiasts of the show ghost of ping says previous connection green check mark keep working on office as time permits closed off a few personal projects and moved some off to someday may be well done our nameless of the show nameless says red circle I didn't get out of the house and got distracted with side projects as well and no schoolwork got done also nameless is name is named right now negative so I'm just I'm just putting that out I can't say nameless is real name nameless will be nameless and finally our tech podcast listener of the show pillix says connection check green heart I did shred those interviews but the first company was not looking for what I'm looking for and the second one ended up not going with me I did go on the hike and it was great it also worked on pod shift haven't figured out the port thing but I did make progress in the API and applying for jobs is still something I do well done getting those two interviews and absolutely nailing them and understanding that it just wasn't for you and that's okay I saw shred those interviews and I was like huh did you like print out do you print out all the questions and stuck them in the shredder I like it I like it that's that should do that actually now anytime I have a bad interview just bad interview just write bad interview on a piece of paper and then stick it in the shredder nice nice uh speaking of things that aren't great um so folks we are going to have a very serious conversation um there will be feelings there will be a lot of them we're going to be talking about an episode of burnout that is ongoing and maybe early predicting um in in one person's case um but we we've told our editor get ready with the edit buttons get ready with the like insert curse words here um like replacement buttons um all those things so that we can talk about this straight up and as transparent as possible that's not to say that we don't try to be transparent it's just this time we might be a little more transparent than we would usually be um so if you are not in a spot where having a a conversation like that is good for you good for your mental then skip this chapter we'll get to the closing connections and we'll call it a day um but if you can bear with us as we we talk about kind of this stuff that's been happening then uh continue to listen on so Kathy how you doing
Yeah no no that's where that's we put we have to put it there because otherwise the dog will eat it um but uh I'm going to actually give myself two green checkmarks because I actually did it twice I cleaned off the table before my amazing cleaning lady came and then I did it again so it still cleaned off so go me that's good um uh yeah I I gave this ominous connection to you over the phone listen

speaking of things that aren't great um so folks we are going to have a very serious conversation um there will be feelings there will be a lot of them we're going to be talking about an episode of burnout that is ongoing and maybe early predicting um in in one person's case um but we we've told our editor get ready with the edit buttons get ready with the like insert curse words here um like replacement buttons um all those things so that we can talk about this straight up and as transparent as possible that's not to say that we don't try to be transparent it's just this time we might be a little more transparent than we would usually be um so if you are not in a spot where having a a conversation like that is good for you good for your mental then skip this chapter we'll get to the closing connections and we'll call it a day um but if you can bear with us as we we talk about kind of this stuff that's been happening then uh continue to listen on so Kathy how you doing Funnily enough almost exactly a year ago is when in episode 61 we talked about burnout and is it seasonal
Funnily enough almost exactly a year ago is when in episode 61 we talked about burnout and is it seasonal Apparently it seems to be seasonal by light too like uh yeah seasonal burnout effective disorder or self-think I don't know I don't know if it's uh it's it's possibly seasonal or it didn't get fixed last year and it's just gotten worse um which is also entirely possible uh yeah I'm um not doing super great right now um and it's hard for me to say uh it's difficult to admit it that it's gotten as bad as it has um but funnily enough I was talking to a friend last week and I was just like I I had sat down to do my brain dumping um and nothing was coming out I could not think of anything outside of like housework things to do and I was like this is not what this is supposed like obviously I understand brain dumping is supposed to just get everything out of your brain and like it was all just like house stuff I could not put formulae work things into what needed to be done like I knew I had my my checklist of like the bare minimum stuff that happens every week or like projects that are ongoing that need basically you know little bits every day to just keep moving them forward but I could not put into any sort of formulation anything really and uh I was talking to a friend um and I was just like I don't know if I'm like really lazy right now or depressed uh and she was like uh have you thought of it then maybe you're burned out I was like oh and it was kind of flipped that switch that this is not something that planning is gonna fix or any sort of productivity tips like this is a much deeper issue going on that I have just kind of tried to compartmentalize and hide from and it's um surprise not be fixed and it sucks I first want to say I'm sorry that you're going through this because yeah that that feeling of not knowing where to start yes is is always the it's it's always an indicator of like the the post burnout like not not the post burnout as it's over but like the post burnout of like you're on fire you're not yeah you're not like oh it's about to happen um I think you know we talked about this a little bit in early episodes that I I know what some of my burnout triggers are um I will start a podcast their runs for three years uh I will start a nonprofit um I will pick up a new coding project basically I will do as many things as possible to avoid the thing that is causing the most pain um but but I won't I will refuse to admit there's a problem so I'm glad that you had someone there to go like it's not that you're you know you're having brain frog moments it's not that you're having you know it's it's nothing that is a like Kathy just doesn't have it it is like no there there's a serious problem that needs to be looked at and addressed and it may even be beyond you looking at it to help you identify maybe the first place to to begin putting out the fire yeah and and one of those things is I know I have been without a therapist for a bit um and I am starting to look to find a new one um which I know will help um because a lot of a lot of the things going on are not like it's not just work related burnout it's uh significant like other things going on that I'm not going to really get into now um I'm okay everyone's safe like that's not please please know that's we should have also mentioned before like we we got all super serious and there's probably a super serial warning at the beginning of the show like I asked Kathy like hey do we want to skip the show and Kathy was like no this needs to happen like we need to we need to be be doing this um this you know the show is a good thing so yeah yeah talking talking it through um is is helpful um in a way I mean and it like so I did a podcast yesterday also with our amazing Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show what I wasn't invited no you're not sorry I know but it was an incredible relief to do because it was so much fun playing games with friends um it was a relief to play um and it felt really really good um we know so but I I had a thought there where I was like do I cancel because I didn't because life has just been you know how it is I have been good and like canceling some other things um and like trying to yes thank you Erica I'm so glad Erica's in the livestream right now um like she was saying that I could have canceled yes I could have I'm very glad I didn't because it was a relief it was a release it was a way to kind of check myself out a little bit to just be again I'm trying not to compartmentalize as much as I have in the past um but it was it was just kind of a pause it was a way to put a pause on things um and it was it was so much fun it was absolutely the people work fantastic it was like so much it was yeah it was it was wonderful it was wonderful um yeah so we'll I'll put a link to now I will put a link to the game show feed so that you can hear it when it comes out on November 5th um but I have canceled a couple things that I was supposed to do this weekend um there are other things that I could cancel but that I want to do and so I'm not canceling it because I want to do these things um and I not just uh oh I guess I'll do this but in a I really like this is a good thing type of a situation um so it's it's it's almost like we're doing I'm doing the tire method again for everything now which like even things that I've already said yes to if that makes sense so even if a decision was made in the past and I'm realizing that this is not the right time for it the right place for it I'm trying to set these boundaries so that I can work through what the heck is going on in my brain oh my gosh I'm gonna sht it's a lot and and that's okay it's okay to have a lot going on and it's okay to feel it and get it and sit with it and it can also be really hard and the fact that it's hard is also okay I think that's the that's the thing that I often forget about when I when I think of the instances in which I know I'm doing too much is that um I think we talked about this in one of our episodes about you know planners and doers and kind of like the difference between those kind of personality types of when when I start to think it's not okay is when I take on more even though there are people around me that could potentially help that could you know provide some insight provide some assistance or even better just say hey it's not that not not the situation isn't that serious but it's okay to drop this plate in fact it's okay to smash that plate like one of the things I one of the things I was like Kathy you should go to a red room and you should let it out and just break stuff um but yeah there there are a lot of things that are okay to let fall the baldness have to stay in the air yeah and my biggest thing right now is making sure that I'm listening to myself to say that I'm not a failure for having to cancel things or say no to things or to choose to do something else then I would have maybe done in the past um and to to really like be okay truly with turning off for a bit um I had a lunch with a friend and we were talking about this and discussing because we had been planning for a while to take a trip up to Vancouver BC just for a weekend and uh it came up but it's like well it feels like we're running away and then you still have to come back to reality um and it became a conversation of like that's okay like it's okay to know that nothing necessarily is changing and still to take a break if that makes sense like having having time to breathe um can make it easier to then do the things that you need to do when you get back so I don't know I don't know when that's gonna happen we've been talking about it for like eight months so probably a while um but it's it's the the idea that it's okay to just step away and then and know that nothing necessarily has changed at home um when you come back is okay to to do that escape to to take that pause that moment to be like okay it's it's it's hard and it's okay to step away for a second I I definitely feel that um I talked about this you know new opportunity and things and I I even again I wrote a blog post I've been writing blog posts lately I don't know why um I feel it's weird I found out that people actually do read my blog that's amazing I don't I don't have any analytics on it because I was like no I don't care I don't like I want people to read it but like at the same time like I don't want to know that they read it and I don't like I don't want to get like an idea about myself or whatever but like I'm not a blogger we talk about um clearly you are but in in that I I wrote about how um this last round of layoffs like it's funny I'm wearing a vest that says I've been marketing I even doesn't have a marketing department anymore like the team that I was a part of like the greater team that I was a part of no longer exists um the CMO got laid off so wow wow wait so like are they not doing what you know what exactly there's a lot of look at me I tired the heck out of this and I said nope we're gonna not even touch that there's a lot of questions that a lot of questions there yep yep so I report to product now um but I also don't and what's really interesting is that my team that I started with of 12 people is now four and I am now in a situation to where I'm watching the three of them just have to deal with the wreckage my boss got laid off nobody like my boss didn't even know that they were being laid off oh my gosh and no one had time to transfer accounts over no one had time to say like hey who pays for this now um we basically got dumped onto another team and no offense to them but you know they're coming in and they're going hey so who has the password to this and we're like I don't know not us we weren't given it you weren't given it oh how do we find out who who owns it and then meanwhile I'm being expected to be like the senior the senior person in the room when I'm not even in the room I'm hey in Toronto doing other stuff and I'm being asked to talk to C CIOs and senior VPs of stuff about like hey here's how we do things and I'm being asked to speak and travel and do all this other stuff and it's it's it's a moment where if it weren't for this show I probably would have said yes to everything and burned out but like having a unicorn in my like my little like coat pocket to go hey unicorn what should I do Jiminy Kathy what should I do let's see now I need my own little unicorn to to talk to me because yeah I it's hard to do for yourself what you are doing for others yeah and I and I think that that's I mean that's like the best advice that I could I could even possibly impart is just like Kathy what would you tell me if I were you right oh yeah and then just do that don't do what I would do because I would do beyond visit yeah yeah that's probably a good idea uh yeah I don't have an easy fun solution right now I don't have like an easy way or silly way to be like aha yeah like problem solved or anything I have what I hope will help for the future but like not basically the hardest part is knowing that this isn't going to be a okay I'm gonna fix this by next conduit yeah I have an analogy that may work it's not a fun when I'm sorry okay especially with you living in Oregon wow it's kind of a real one uh burn out is like a fire in fact it's like a wildfire sometimes you you like you can't stop the house from burning down in a wildfire it burns down um what you can do is try to get ahead of it and protect the things that need to be protected above all else before they catch on fire um so I I can't I can't tell you that it's it's gonna be great or fun or anything like that it's gonna suck and some stuff is just gonna get broken and some stuff's gonna burn down and some stuff's just not gonna be available but hopefully you can get as far out ahead of it as possible and start protecting those things and especially the things that that mean the most um I know that that's one of the things that you know my wife and I wound up having to do honestly in a way that would just help help our marriage when when I was dealing with burn out like what I was dealing with just bad medication in general like ADHD meds were not going well and it got to a point where like we instituted a rule where like each of us could take a weekend and just book a hotel and disappear and kind of be away and that was like the first time where each of us were not with each other and it was it was such a weird moment because it was like it wasn't like we were mad at each other it was just life sucked at the moment and it was getting away from everything to put enough space in between the fire and the things that we really cared about for a few days you know then you talked about going up to Vancouver which I would be so jealous loving you I never been so nice uh never been so jealous of you right now oh I found out I'm not going to Portland after all I'm sad I'll find I'll find another excuse we'll figure it out it'll be something up there um but yeah just being able to to get away from it like knowing that the fire is still there but not having to sit in it is just peaceful if only for a little bit yeah yeah and I think you know I'm again I'm okay like it's it's not fun but I'm I'm hanging in there like I'm not you don't need to worry about me just just wanted to reiterate like I'm okay I just also want you to realize that that's not gonna happen Kathy like people are gonna worry about you I know I know and I don't yeah I don't want that to happen but I know yeah um but I love you all and uh yeah it's okay I'll be okay eventually I hope um it's gonna take some time I think so so Kathy I'm not gonna ask you to do a connection but if you want to do one you totally can't but I'm not gonna ask you to do a connection my connection is going to be to rest okay that's fair it's a good connection yeah um my connection is going to be somewhat not it's not gonna be rest but it's gonna be a little okay so I was gone for a few weeks the layoffs happened and then I had to travel for work for this project and then I got home and my daughter had pneumonia um and she's just now better so and it it ravaged the house I wound up getting sick Brittany wound up getting sick um so everybody is just now recovering um because of that I've had to like try to work while sick and I've been given a lot of grace um but we don't have a lot of time uh so I was also like hey I got to I actually kind of just have to work through it because we've only got like a quarter to do like a few years worth of work um which is not fun which fewer people too with fewer with fewer people um so yeah um I need to figure out what healthy looks like again because I haven't I haven't had healthy normal and really in a few months because of conference season and doing events and again now I'm on this new team but I'm also on this other new team and I've I've got to like look at things and figure out what normal looks like um so yeah that's what I'm gonna that's what I'm gonna do for mine

of the money numbers and get it done oh yeah we just never did it we just we just merged everything and we were like well this is it now we're here the Canadian trivia card enthusiasts of the show Eric has his next connection keep up the yoga and seat saber routine but raise the limit to four songs or 15 minutes to see how it goes and maybe even sub in some short lunchtime walks if the weather is nice enough although it's below freezing right now so maybe not yeah Erica I don't know if you know this um you live in Canada which means your the monitors are all broken so it's not actually freezing it's the end of October almost November which I don't think the weather is going to be nice for a while but again I'm not Canadian so I don't know what nice is but it's probably gonna be cold our checklist enthusiasts of the show first of ping keep working on the personal projects and finish at least one more um yeah Mike you got this oh my gosh in the chat and it says negative 15 is perfectly lovely thank you very much no no negative two see again this is where the Celsius is good for measuring the temperature of things Fahrenheit is good for measuring the temperature of people I know any listen the number should not be negative those are all the same number should never be it should not be negative the only place where it really falls down is like the the temperature in which people are basically dead which is like 106 which is just a weird number and we we seem to live very very close to it our name list of the show named says new connection clean out the box room we are going to do going to be having guests come for the holidays and we are changing the box room to a guest bedroom hidden box room the bed of mattress are getting delivered this conduit so I need there to be space to assemble it um I know that it's the box room as it meaning like that's where your boxes are stored but I really like the idea of you just having a room that's like full of like present boxes like fancy ones from Nordstroms and stuff and they're all like nicely stacked or like I don't even know but obviously that's not what it is uh I was thinking it was like the Olympic village where even the everything was just made the table is a box the mirror is also a box with the picture drawn of it of nameless um yep yeah perfect and then our tech podcast listener of the show pillics says new connection work on pod shift get the new car oh new car what what what what what go to the mechanic and figure out the oil change for the new car interesting um apply for jobs and shred the

Apparently it seems to be seasonal by light too like uh yeah seasonal burnout effective disorder or self-think I don't know I don't know if it's uh it's it's possibly seasonal or it didn't get fixed last year and it's just gotten worse um which is also entirely possible uh yeah I'm um not doing super great right now um and it's hard for me to say uh it's difficult to admit it that it's gotten as bad as it has um but funnily enough I was talking to a friend last week and I was just like I I had sat down to do my brain dumping um and nothing was coming out I could not think of anything outside of like housework things to do and I was like this is not what this is supposed like obviously I understand brain dumping is supposed to just get everything out of your brain and like it was all just like house stuff I could not put formulae work things into what needed to be done like I knew I had my my checklist of like the bare minimum stuff that happens every week or like projects that are ongoing that need basically you know little bits every day to just keep moving them forward but I could not put into any sort of formulation anything really and uh I was talking to a friend um and I was just like I don't know if I'm like really lazy right now or depressed uh and she was like uh have you thought of it then maybe you're burned out I was like oh and it was kind of flipped that switch that this is not something that planning is gonna fix or any sort of productivity tips like this is a much deeper issue going on that I have just kind of tried to compartmentalize and hide from and it's um surprise not be fixed and it sucks I first want to say I'm sorry that you're going through this because yeah that that feeling of not knowing where to start yes is is always the it's it's always an indicator of like the the post burnout like not not the post burnout as it's over but like the post burnout of like you're on fire you're not yeah you're not like oh it's about to happen um I think you know we talked about this a little bit in early episodes that I I know what some of my burnout triggers are um I will start a podcast their runs for three years uh I will start a nonprofit um I will pick up a new coding project basically I will do as many things as possible to avoid the thing that is causing the most pain um but but I won't I will refuse to admit there's a problem so I'm glad that you had someone there to go like it's not that you're you know you're having brain frog moments it's not that you're having you know it's it's nothing that is a like Kathy just doesn't have it it is like no there there's a serious problem that needs to be looked at and addressed and it may even be beyond you looking at it to help you identify maybe the first place to to begin putting out the fire yeah and and one of those things is I know I have been without a therapist for a bit um and I am starting to look to find a new one um which I know will help um because a lot of a lot of the things going on are not like it's not just work related burnout it's uh significant like other things going on that I'm not going to really get into now um I'm okay everyone's safe like that's not please please know that's we should have also mentioned before like we we got all super serious and there's probably a super serial warning at the beginning of the show like I asked Kathy like hey do we want to skip the show and Kathy was like no this needs to happen like we need to we need to be be doing this um this you know the show is a good thing so yeah yeah talking talking it through um is is helpful um in a way I mean and it like so I did a podcast yesterday also with our amazing Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show what I wasn't invited no you're not sorry I know but it was an incredible relief to do because it was so much fun playing games with friends um it was a relief to play um and it felt really really good um we know so but I I had a thought there where I was like do I cancel because I didn't because life has just been you know how it is I have been good and like canceling some other things um and like trying to yes thank you Erica I'm so glad Erica's in the livestream right now um like she was saying that I could have canceled yes I could have I'm very glad I didn't because it was a relief it was a release it was a way to kind of check myself out a little bit to just be again I'm trying not to compartmentalize as much as I have in the past um but it was it was just kind of a pause it was a way to put a pause on things um and it was it was so much fun it was absolutely the people work fantastic it was like so much it was yeah it was it was wonderful it was wonderful um yeah so we'll I'll put a link to now I will put a link to the game show feed so that you can hear it when it comes out on November 5th um but I have canceled a couple things that I was supposed to do this weekend um there are other things that I could cancel but that I want to do and so I'm not canceling it because I want to do these things um and I not just uh oh I guess I'll do this but in a I really like this is a good thing type of a situation um so it's it's it's almost like we're doing I'm doing the tire method again for everything now which like even things that I've already said yes to if that makes sense so even if a decision was made in the past and I'm realizing that this is not the right time for it the right place for it I'm trying to set these boundaries so that I can work through what the heck is going on in my brain oh my gosh I'm gonna sht it's a lot and and that's okay it's okay to have a lot going on and it's okay to feel it and get it and sit with it and it can also be really hard and the fact that it's hard is also okay I think that's the that's the thing that I often forget about when I when I think of the instances in which I know I'm doing too much is that um I think we talked about this in one of our episodes about you know planners and doers and kind of like the difference between those kind of personality types of when when I start to think it's not okay is when I take on more even though there are people around me that could potentially help that could you know provide some insight provide some assistance or even better just say hey it's not that not not the situation isn't that serious but it's okay to drop this plate in fact it's okay to smash that plate like one of the things I one of the things I was like Kathy you should go to a red room and you should let it out and just break stuff um but yeah there there are a lot of things that are okay to let fall the baldness have to stay in the air yeah and my biggest thing right now is making sure that I'm listening to myself to say that I'm not a failure for having to cancel things or say no to things or to choose to do something else then I would have maybe done in the past um and to to really like be okay truly with turning off for a bit um I had a lunch with a friend and we were talking about this and discussing because we had been planning for a while to take a trip up to Vancouver BC just for a weekend and uh it came up but it's like well it feels like we're running away and then you still have to come back to reality um and it became a conversation of like that's okay like it's okay to know that nothing necessarily is changing

that um I talked about this you know new opportunity and things and I I even again I wrote a blog post I've been writing blog posts lately I don't know why um I feel it's weird I found out that people actually do read my blog that's amazing I don't I don't have any analytics on it because I was like no I don't care I don't like I want people to read it but like at the same time like I don't want to know that they read it and I don't like I don't want to get like an idea about myself or whatever but like I'm not a blogger we talk about um clearly you are but in in that I I wrote about how um this

started with of 12 people is now four and I am now in a situation to where I'm watching the three of them just have to deal with the wreckage my boss got laid off nobody like my boss didn't even know that they were being laid off oh my gosh and no one had time to transfer accounts over no one had time to say like hey who pays for this now um we basically got dumped onto another team and no offense to them but you know they're coming in and they're going hey so who has the password to this and we're like I don't know not us we weren't given it you weren't given it oh how do we find out who who owns it and then meanwhile I'm being expected to be like the senior the senior person in the room when I'm not even in the room I'm hey in Toronto doing other stuff and I'm being asked to talk to C CIOs and senior VPs of stuff about like hey here's how we do things and I'm being asked to speak and travel and do all this other stuff and it's it's it's a moment where if it weren't for this show I probably would have said yes to everything and burned out but like having a unicorn in my like my little like coat pocket to go hey unicorn what should I do Jiminy Kathy what should I do let's see now I need my own little unicorn to to talk to me because yeah I it's hard to do for yourself what you are doing for others yeah and I and I think that that's I mean that's like the best advice that I could I could even possibly impart is just like Kathy what would you tell me if I were you right oh yeah and then just do that don't do what I would do because I would do beyond visit yeah yeah that's probably a good idea uh yeah I don't have an easy fun solution right now I don't have like an easy way or silly way to be like aha yeah like problem solved or anything I have what I hope will help for the future but like not basically the hardest part is knowing that this isn't going to be a okay I'm gonna fix this by next conduit yeah I have an analogy that may work it's not a fun when I'm sorry okay especially with you living in Oregon wow it's kind of a real one uh burn out is like a fire in fact it's like a wildfire sometimes you you like you can't stop the house from burning down in a
