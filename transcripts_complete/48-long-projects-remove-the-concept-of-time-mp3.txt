From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that likes short goals and long planning. This episode is brought to you by Memberful. I'm Kathy and with me is a very incorrect human named Jay. They're all tamales. You cannot convince me otherwise. No, it's fine. You're wrong. Whatever. The reason that this introduction exists because of the live show, which we record every two weeks in the Relay FM Switch on Discord. And we had a very in-depth conversation where Jay is incorrect. If they want to know why everything is a tamale, then they can go to I'm a super conductor. .com and become a superconductor. And then they can tell us where their allegiance lie. Are you team tamale? Are you team losing? Wow. This is my show and it's fine. But some of the other things you can get when you become a member is some of these incredible conversations other than in the live show where we argue about things. But in the Discord, the scrub daddy content is strong. Someone discovered that they did in fact have a scrub daddy, but it's been used so much that it looks like a loofah, which is entertaining. And then someone also brought up the fact that on Reddit, there was someone that got an order of three scrub daddies and one of them only has one eyeball. So it's a scrub daaardy. So I thought that was really entertaining. You can be a part of all of these inside jokes by joining the membership and become a member in the Discord. And if you are already a member, you can go to your member full account and follow the links and instructions to join the Discord. And if you support us directly, us, Conduit, the team that is team Conduit, team Conduit, you then get to hang out in our coworking session where we talked about the ever evolving situation that is social media. And if that doesn't entice you, like I know it does. We also learned how Kathy has effectively pulled the or lifted the we have to be well behaved in our coworking space. All the bleeping. Yeah, we get we get real, real gritty, real hardcore in the coworking space when we talk about all the stuff, no filters, no nothing held back. So yeah, if you want to enjoy that experience of watching Kathy say all the bad words, I'm a superconductor.com. That's a letter I letter M letter A superconductor.com. All right, let's get some shout outs. Jay, do you have a shout out? I do. Shout out to our amazing editor, Javier, who is actually going on vacation. So we're just going to warn you now that the next episode of Conduit has already been recorded. We had to record it last week so that our editor could enjoy their vacation where I'm not going to tell you where they're going, but it's going to be really fun. I'm jealous and I wish I was there with them. But we want to make sure that we respect good work life balance and healthy boundaries and all these other productivity buzzwords that usually don't mean anything. We want them to mean something here. So we have already recorded that episode. That episode is being edited, maybe not as we speak, but it is being taken care of already. So there will be a little episode out of time that will not be like any of the other shows that we do normally, but fret not. But also kind of like the shows that we do because it is spoiler, I guess. It's a systems check, which you if you listen to the show or if you want to go back to our history, you'll discover the fact that we've done systems checks before. Yes. And because of that, we're actually giving people some extra time for their connections this week. And we'll talk a little bit more about that later. So if you haven't already gotten your connection in, check out the episode and then think about it and then give us your connection and make it especially long because we will not cover it for at least a month. So yes, there's that. Hence the jokes at the beginning. Long planning. Anyways, another shout out to our very special Carrie, who is our chief advertising officer here at Relay FM Switch On, who has gotten us so many great sponsors for the upcoming episodes. I am very excited for the one that has a shipment arriving. They've tailored it to my food requirements and I cannot wait for it to arrive. So I think that's some exciting. Sorry somebody here is allergic to onions. I can't help things. It's fine. But anyways, how about we do our connection check? Zap! Said the tamale. All right, Sandwich, how did you do on your connection? Yeah, about that. So my connection was to create a T minus whatever for the next event that was happening in June. I know I was supposed to do it and I was like, well, I at least need a countdown timer. So at first it was going to be a red like did not do. And then I was like, you know what, I can at least do that. I can at least give myself a countdown timer so I know how long I have until the thing happening and that'll give me the energy and mental awareness to do the things. And to my surprise, I had already created one, which was great. So I gave myself an extra bonus point there for having already done the thing that I was going to do, which was the bare minimum for the thing that I needed to do. But also I have not done anything beyond that. So therefore I'm giving myself an orange circle. Kathy, what about, oh, I guess one more thing. Folks like to know what apps we use from time to time. We normally don't tell them. I'll tell them this time only because it's kind of new and I'm playing around with it. It's called Up Ahead. And I think there's been some blog posts about it on like Mac stories and all that stuff. So go check that out if you want. But yeah, that was me. Kathy, how'd you do? Well, not great. So my connection was to solidify a plan for planning when coming back from a trip. And this particular trip coming back was a lot. Chaos was deep, deep in our life. And that's OK. I'm acknowledging it. I'm letting it go. And I am giving myself a red X because I did not even begin it. But that's OK, because again, we survived, including Mini Soup being really sick after getting four teeth extracted. And so it was just kind of a hot mess, as they say. So you know what? That's OK. We'll see what this next time brings. And yes, Ramon, there's still time if you want to add a connection. We can toss that in because you'll be giving a connection for the next round, which means you don't have a connection check. So we have plenty of time. So you can throw that in now if you would like. Just make sure to give us your of the show name and don't pick Tamale. All right, Jay, what about our conductors? How did their connections go? Our sloth of the show, Ankenu, said that they wrapped up the last three characters for the first commission set and put a couple of hours into the second, no longer working from home. So the commute has left them with little time and energy, but they are working to carve things out. Nice. Our fish bear of the show, Fishikai, has a green book. Well, technically it's a total success because I made a household task list and thought about priorities like I wanted. Didn't go exactly as planned, though. You are more aware than I am how complex this type of project can be. I very quickly decided the best way to chase success was by lowering the bar. I now have tasks in two piles, have to do and everything else. And that's good enough for now. Heck, yeah, it is. Oh, my gosh, I'm so proud of you. It's OK to lower the bar. It's OK to not have those expectations and to make those adjustments in a way that lets you be successful. So I am super proud of you. Well done. And our Ain't No Mountain High dwelling of the show, Logang, said green tree tile laid and grouted wood floors put in. It's starting to look really housey. I'm glad that it looks nice and cozy, awesome and housey. And I guess if you run into any problems, call around to rousey. I don't know. I love it. Well done. Well, frickin done. All right. Our shark of the show, Chris, says connection check green checkmark. I was able to get my home office ready for the arrival of the in-laws. They arrived the day that this episode records and someone didn't delete the end of that, but that's fine. Well done, Chris. I am so glad that your in-laws hopefully have made it OK and are getting nice and cozy in the clean home office. Our panda of the show, James, says surprising everybody involved. I have actually relaxed reasonably well for the last couple of weeks. Yay. And I've made steps towards being more social. Oh, I mean, I don't know. I don't know if we're already. I guess. Yay. Well, which is equally good for my brain. OK, fair enough. Fair enough. Yay. We'll go back to that. All right. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron, says connection check green checkmark. I made appointment for some blood work this week, hoping the results will be on the up and up. I hope that they are as well. Let us know either way if you would like. I hope everything's great. Our Oracle of the show, Soph, has a green apple. I did the meditating thing and I submitted the journal article I've been working on for about two months. Little bits of work making big progress. Oh, that sounds awesome and very close to what we're talking about today. I love it. Do do do. All right. Our train enthusiast of the show, Railsie, says connection check yellow heart. I haven't quite done as I hope. It's time to use this month to do something a bit larger. Spoiler alert. Somebody is was at the live recording for our last episode that will be the next episode. Our blue dragon of the show, Skyler, says blue heart. The semester is done once again. Survived. Congratulations on yet another survival. Again, if you need help, I heard Rhonda Rousey is about. All right. Our last connection check from our conductors is from Robert, the nameless of the show. Connect and check green circle. I got my listing ready and it has been uploaded for sale. I also have been listening to more music and have been really enjoying going through my Spotify artist top five. I love that you kind of have the split into and you did both of them. And also one of them is for fun and one of them is for not fun. So, I mean, listing is also never mind. Anyways, this episode of Conduit is brought to you by our good friends at memberful.

Our thanks to memberful for their support of this show and all of Relay FM. And with every ad read, I like to pick a random language to say thank you in. And this one. Oh, you did this to yourself. I did this one to myself. I picked Marathi and I'm going to do my best on this. I'm going to say. Don Yavada. OK, yeah, we're going to go with that. If I was even close, let me know. And if I wasn't and you speak Marathi, then be sure to send us an audio recording of how to say that properly. And I apologize for any mistakes that I made in trying to say that. All right, so we are going to be talking about long term planning today, and that's mainly because there will be a full month to work on your next connection instead of just the two weeks. And so we kind of wanted to discuss how planning for a long term thing works differently than a short term or even two weeks. And how your mindset can kind of adjust. I know I have a hard harder time sitting and like going, OK, if I don't have to do this now, I will procrastinate and put it off for a bit, which is not great. I know that this is not the healthiest way to do things. And yet it's how my brain works. And so I am constantly working towards trying to be better at all of these things. And what do you think? How does your brain work over there? Well, first, we have to we have to check to see if it works. Well, yes, that's true. When I start trying to do long term stuff, I like that is like the biggest struggle for me is I believe how my old boss used to say, it's a marathon and not a sprint. I was like, I was born to be a sprinter. Like I have asthma. Like the longer I have to do a thing, the more tired I get. And then and then you start running into issues. And honestly, I tend to. Work better with very well defined constraints, deadlines and them being approaching. A good example of this is I was working on a project with a colleague and. The colleague was like, hey, I can only work on this for 45 minutes. And I was like, oh, great. That's that's awesome. Let me start a timer. And they were like, oh, like the excitement level is high. And I was like, yes, because I know if I only have 45 minutes to do this, it's going to get done. Like we're going to get done. And honestly, the less time that we have, the more like the more the better quality of the thing will be, because I won't have time to sit there and overthink, overcorrect, overadjust. Yes. And what I've tried to do in kind of this longer form planning is to. I want to say chunk it down, but like basically segment it into small deliverables with extremely tight deadlines. Yes. So that I can I can still work in that very small. Like, I've got to get this done in this time, which also might be the deadline. Like, I guess a good example for that is I'm giving it. I was asked to give a talk, but I have to give the details of the talk and I have like three more days left to submit that talk. The event itself isn't happening until October, but obviously I waited until the last minute for the deadline to submit the talk. And that worked because I had all the things I needed already. I just needed to remove the concept of time, which gave me the ability to overthink it, which is awesome. Yeah, that is also definitely how I work. A lot of times I have a client who he thinks very big picture and I will take those big picture moments and kind of drill down and be like, OK, so these are the steps that I need to get this going. I need to get this and get started. But I do not want to think about the future things until I'm done with the current things. And that is really difficult for me to be able to kind of wrap my brain around what happens in the future too far, especially if there's steps that have to be finished beforehand, which is very interesting and difficult. But, you know, it's important to know how your brain works and it's important to be able to make the adjustments that you need in order to like be productive, I guess. I think in some ways it is that idea of, you know, a lot of people can't see the forest from the trees. And I think that it's good to have someone who is very good at looking at the forest. But also, I don't know how many people have seen this, like the world's largest organism. And it's literally like this fungus thing that looks like an entire forest. That my brain works in giant fungus thing like all the forest. The forest is the tree. It's just one. And I have to take care of it from a health standpoint because if the tree goes, the whole forest is gone. And I think that that's again, that works in some ways and that works in some mindsets. But I think there is also a benefit of being a part of a team that is. You have some people who are tree watchers or tree gazers. You have some people who are bird watchers and then you have some people who are like up in the helicopter or up in the guard post looking at the entire forest. Yes. I think that's like the best thing to do and to put you know where you are in that space and put yourself around people who are going to help with that. And I think that was that was another conversation that came up in our coworking session, Kathy. Yeah. In that I actually know it didn't because it came out. It came up in the episode that'll be out next week in two weeks because time is hard. Time. Yeah. Out of time. Episode out of time. It's difficult. Yeah. But as as we as you will learn about next week, my my systems check this this time around was a little daunting and challenging because I am struggling to find a system that works well at observing the forest. Because I'm so used to being in the tree. Like I'm so used to that drilled in focus. And now I need a tool that's going to give me a better overall view. But I won't go into too much detail about that here. Save that one for two weeks from now. Yeah, I tend to collect people around me that have a higher level view because it is so difficult for me to work my brain on that. I have to work very difficult to try and have larger steps. And I know that's a fail. Not a failure, but I know that's a difficulty in me. But I I'm aware of it, which means I can try and work harder. But again, it's really difficult for me. It's so hard. Have you been have you been able to convey that to those people? I know that you have an entire blessing that you're responsible of and for. Is that something that you openly speak to when you're like if you're providing mentorship or guidance, you're like, hey, I'm going to be able to give you a lot of this mindset from this perspective, because this is where I'm great. You may also want to talk to someone who has better knowledge and maybe this long form planning area. Kind of, but not really, mainly because most of the things that I do when I am like mentoring is working with the person and how their brain works, which is really just asking the questions and paying attention to the answers and what they're not saying with words, which means I don't have to do I'm not doing the long term planning for them. I'm giving them the guidance to do it themselves, if that makes sense. Yeah, so I don't have to have someone that my brain doesn't have to work with long term planning to know how it can work for somebody that is able to do it, if that makes sense. Yeah, I remember it. I don't remember. I think it was our last systems check. I had mentioned mind mapping and you were like, yeah, no, my brain. My brain don't do that. Nope. How do you because again, we've talked a lot about, you know, hey, planning for the long term, find someone that's good at it. What if that person doesn't exist? What have you never mind? It's your show you know, no, hey, just because I'm the one that's like introducing doesn't mean that it's just my show. That's the whole point of being co-hosts is sitting and having these conversations together, including questions like, yeah. Yeah, yeah. What was your question? How, when there isn't someone there, how do you, how do you kind of fit the square peg of long planning into the round hole that is my brain best works in short form? By making it up as I go along? Oh, I like that. That's that's very, very blunt, honestly. I'm very agile and I work better solving immediate problems. Very reactive in the way that it works. And for most of the things, apparently it's working just fine. And I guess that's okay. Until I find something that makes a big concern, I'm gonna gonna do it. And yeah, Real Z has a suggestion and this is very much kind of where I'm at. So breaking a big thing into smaller chunks and just focus on that one chunk in a short period of defined time. With the exception that I'm not breaking the bigger project down. I am doing that step that I know needs to happen first. And then when that project is done, I'm figuring out what the next project is. And so it's a very soft form of the larger end goal, but it works with my brain. I enjoy the make it up as I go along because that to me that is I I still feel as if the the enemy of long planning is often the idea that every step needs to be understood. Yes. All the time. Especially because you do not know what is going to happen when you start doing the first things. Well, it's like, it's that whole thing about boxing. Like everyone has a plan until you get punched in the face. I believe Mike Tyson said that. But like, you can have an idea of what you you want to happen. And I feel as if holding on to that idea so tightly that you're unable to, I think you use the word be agile. To be to be adjustable, to be able to to think about it. I'm almost like almost like that. Hear me out, Kathy. What what I think there's this game where you have a bunch of pieces and the pieces fall down into certain and you put them in certain places. I think it's called Tetris or something like that. No, that can't be it. Because it's like, again, the beauty of it is that you only know what the next piece is. You don't know. And I guess in some games you might know a couple of pieces down the road. And even in other games, there's an algorithm that like you can you can kind of identify what the next piece is. Anyway, in the in the best form of the game, like you only know the next piece. That's it. You know what you have and you know the very next piece coming up. And you have to position your board in a way that it's flexible to be able to handle the next piece. That's it. You know what you have and you know the very next piece coming up and you have to position your board in a way that it's flexible to be able to handle pieces in any pattern that may appear or in the best pattern that appear. And this is how some of the best players of that game have been able to just continuously break barriers of like, oh, well, the game was designed to only work to this score. Well, they broke that. Oh, well, we thought that no one would ever be able to play past this level. They broke that. And the way that they did it was they started coming up with a standard way of stacking pieces so that. You could deal with droughts happening where you don't get the piece that you need for 40 or 50 pieces and you're still able to be flexible enough to deal with that. And I think that that's where when you're talking about long planning, like that's to me the biggest like help. Like we had our big event that we just got back from or that I just got back from. We almost like we had to literally run to the dollar store and get like dollar store lights to help decorate our booth because. We didn't know what the setup was going to be until we got there. Right. So no matter how much we were like, well, let's have let's make sure we have this many microphones or let's make sure we have this amount of chairs or open spaces and this amount of lighting. We had none of that. We literally got there and we were like, OK, we're here. We can start planning around that versus being like, well, let's create five different alternative scenarios of what's going to happen. Right. Yeah, you can't. You can do planning up to a point. It's important to to like. Be aware of the limitations of planning that you can do. And make sure that it. Does not hinder your goals too, because you want to make sure that you are doing the planning required to be prepped. Without. Over planning to waste your time and also like cause. Significant issues if stuff doesn't work. I guess the only other piece of that maybe is the. Like, I don't know if it's like, know the plan, know when the plan is off the rails and then understand how to get back onto the rails, maybe. Oh, my gosh, I I'm laughing because I this tick tock came up on my like reminder like my history. And now I need to log in and find it because it's one of my favorite. And hold on, let me see if I can find it. Well, while Kathy is looking for that, I will expound on that on that idea or that thought there. We've talked about like, oh, when you plan, you know, don't plan too far ahead. Don't. Don't immediately like. Panic when things don't go the way that you want. There's my experience in the military was was kind of great in this in that you have. Like this. This like what happens when things don't work and kind of unexpected thing. And I think that's where like the. What happens when things don't work and kind of an unexpected thing. And I think that's where like good documentation kind of comes into play. And again, this is this is where seeing the tree and not the forest in many ways is super helpful. In the the bullet journal method, they're like the book, the bullet journal method. There is this story about someone who documented like they do bullet journaling and all this other stuff. And then their kid gets sick. And because. They bullet journaled everything they had this like these detailed notes of everything that was happening with their child that they could just hand to the doctor. And I know that like most of us have smartwatches that collect health data and do all that other stuff. And now they have that information. But that was actually something that I took from. That's like the most important thing that I took from that book was that like I started creating these small logs for any time my child got sick. It would be like, OK, this time, here's the event that happened. And it was funny because I took that from a different experience that I had while I was in the military, where we were, quote unquote, on duty, where literally we had to document. We had to like walk around whatever we were on watch for every interval of time. Sometimes it was like an hour, sometimes 30 minutes or whatever. And then we would have to document anything that we saw during that time that was out of the ordinary. Oh, sprinkler was on or something and it wasn't supposed to be on or, oh, hey, had to stop this fight from happening here. And it was at this time, at this date. And these were the people involved. Or, hey, I just walked around and nothing happened. I walked around and everything was good. And I think that everyone hates doing that. And everyone's like, why am I doing that? Until you need to go back and go through that log and be like, OK, the last time this happened, I saw this thing happen at this time. Things were good for three hours and then things went off the rails. So that gives me three hours to figure out what I need to do and how I need to prepare for how they went off the rails. And also, here's what we did to remediate the problem. So being able to just document and again, being able to sometimes study the tree will give you the ability to understand what's happening in the forest in a better way. So that when something happens, you're able to get back to it. Kathy, it looks like you found your video. I did. And Soph, I think, made the quote. So it's make the plan, execute the plan, expect the plan to go off the rails, throw away the plan. Yes. Yeah, I'm glad I spent that time looking for this very important TikTok to contribute to the conversation. Oh, goodness. So, yeah, I think it's also important to think of the long term plans and what foundational moments you can. Like help support the long term plan, whether it's, you know, the basics like hydration and eating and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But also like the little things that can make you be able to actually succeed with those plans. So just the pieces involved and making sure you have access to the tools that you need before you need them. And so planning to get the things in place is important, too. Ooh, Ramon has a very good point in the chat. Aren't plans just strong ideas that can change? I like that, actually, a lot. I do wonder how. And I feel like this is a question I need to ask my wife because. There is there is like this level of determination that I think also comes into factor in terms of plans. Great example of this recently, I have come to want a 3D printer. And in my mind, I'm like, I need to come up with a plan to get this 3D printer. And the first the first stage of that plan was, what are all of the things that I could make with a 3D printer? And then it was like, well, here's all the things I could make that would benefit me. Now, what are the things that would benefit the rest of the people in the family so that a 3D printer is more likely to look like a good idea and to really have them excited to have one in the house or not in the house or like in the garage or whatever? But then also, I am the person who needs to also do the research on. What 3D printer? How much does it cost? Can I get it used? Should I get it used? What does construction look like? How much space does it take up? Does it have a smell? And like all of these little things, and I need to be prepared for all of these as they're happening, because. That's that's where, like, I think that there is like planning and then there's like implementation of said plan. Yes. And I also think that there's like that, you know, we've talked about like have a plan. Plan doesn't work, goes off the rails. You got to give up. I think that that is a different. Portion of. Quote unquote planning. Then the. Let's let's me some plus this, let's grab all the things that we need to know. And maybe that's like a step in there is like grab the things that you need to know, grab the things that you. Might want to be prepared for and grab the things that you don't need to know right now. But at least you know that you don't need to know them right now. I think that would have probably have saved me so much time and energy and so many plans of like. This is a need to know now, this is a need to know later and need to know laters are perfectly fine. Let's not focus all of our energy on that. Let's focus on the need to know now. Yes, yeah. And and the other things that will happen will come up when you need it. Yep. Again, we're just making it up as we go along. Yes. But we know that we're making it up as we go along. That's the ticket. You're planning to make it up as you go along. Excellent. All right, Jay, what is your connection for the next month? Since we're not doing it for a fortnight, we're doing this connection for the whole month. By the time we record again. There will have been a decision made on if I am buying a house. Which is it sounds like terrifying to say that. Yeah. But I just went and like did the math and know that that totally checks out. So again, my family is looking at doing a cross country move. It's been this whole thing. I'm excited about it. There's there's a lot of factors that are going into that. This is a big plan. This is a plan that might be for the next few months. This is a plan that might be a year out. You know, if if we get into a property that has to be constructed. By that time, I will know that part of the plan right now. I don't know that part of the plan. So for right now, I feel like my connection should be document the things that I need to be thinking about right now. And then also document the things that I need to be thinking about later. And I am going to. Use a tool that I often don't that I try to avoid. Which is to do is to figure this out. And there's a reason for that. Kathy and I have talked about this again. If you want to know why I chose to do is in this case, wait a couple of weeks for that system. And then you will understand why I'm choosing to use that and why I'm not using what I want to use. It's a good one. Mm hmm. It's a good one. It's a good one. I have discovered, you know, these hot girl walks are a thing, and I usually feel better about them when I do them. But also. My dog does so much better when she has a walk. This allows me to clear my mind a little bit. I usually will listen to music or possibly a podcast, depending on my brain. And I come back recharged and ready to do whatever needs to happen. And. I am going to. Walk. At least once a day. Within reason with, you know, I am going to consider this a green checkmark if I have done at least three walks a week. With the goal to do more, but I know like this upcoming weekend, I'm not going to be home, so I can't walk. There's going to be a variety of different things that I know are going to come up, but the weather is getting nicer. It's not a million degrees, which is nice, but it's also not, you know, in the 40s. So I think this walk will. Help everyone, including my dog, who is now sleeping because we took a walk before this podcast. I look forward to hearing you walking it out or at least talking about walking it out or maybe walking like you talk it. Wow. Is there a walk in your pocket? Is there a walk in your pocket? Oh, no. Oh, no, we're moving on. Our connections from our conductors, our sloth, sloth of the show, Ankenu, next Fortnite slash month, complete the second paint commission, 12 models, including a centerpiece character. Oh, I'm so excited to see in hashtag creativity and see how it's going. I love it. Our fish bear of the show, Fish Kai says new connection. I'd like to get back into some creative outlets. I haven't touched in a while. Oh, creative outlets don't stick forks in them. That could be dangerous. You're such a dad. All right. Mountain dweller of the show Logang. Was that acceptable? I thought that was OK. I love the what was that that letter after the G? It was like it was the A.E. thing. I don't know. Sure. I was trying to be Jay, but guess not. Logan. Logan G. He says next connection, spend time with loved ones. Two of my best friends are in town and my sister and her kids will get in town this weekend. I love that. Have fun with family and friends. And our lost browser of the show, me said, stalling, stalling, stalling, found it. OK. Our shark of the show. No, that was. Yep. Shark of the show. Chris says my connection for the next condo is to get my training plan figured out so I can prepare to run with my team at work on the hood to coast relay switch on. No, no, sorry. Different relay. That sounds awesome. It also sounds like it is a long plan up ahead. Yes. Yeah. The hood to coast is you're running from Mount Hood to the Oregon coast, and it's as difficult as you would think it is. Yeah, I will never do that. But I my dad has driven for it before because they have little like vans because one person runs and they're like, oh, I'm going to run. Because one person runs and then you get picked up in the car and another person is running. So you're not actually running the entire way from the mountain to the coast. But anyways, it doesn't matter. Moving on to our panda of the show, James, new connection. Spend the month leading up to the Apple spend the month leading up to Apple's developer conference, doing more fun and silly things, which may involve playing the new Zelda game, but not too much. But hopefully also seeing friends in person. Yay, friends and having fun and doing silly things. I know you can you can do it. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron says new connection. Make some firm decisions around the specifics of the trip coming in June and July. Plus, do some prep to start doing some longer plans. I mean, hikes close to home over the next two months. Hey, that's that's awesome. I I love how a lot of stuff is coming up for people. And it's not like next week. It's it's it's almost like we did this at the exact proper time. I mean, we did because this is when it happened and we're making it up as we go along. Absolutely. Our our train enthusiast of the show, Railsies new connection complete step one of Project Data Works to. It's simple, but I have a checklist to do for this first step. Managing your data is hard these days and I'm taking the first step. Let's use what I found from the last few conduits to build up a habit to get this project done. Yes. Yeah. Our blue dragon of the show, Skyler, says, don't work. I'm just going to stop and say, don't work too hard over the next two weeks. Let's just erase the whole second half that don't work. Work is over. How about don't work too hard? How about that? Don't just don't just don't. Our nameless of the show, Robert's new connection, schedule a date for an open house at by listing. Heck to the yeah, that's exciting. Again, Robert, if if you just happen to be in the area that I'm at, I'm going to be in the area that I'm at. Yeah, let me give me the details on that. I don't think you are. But if you are and our distracted Colombian of the show, Ramon says connection, I will finish my short book. I want to know, are you writing the short book or reading the short book? I feel like either one you can do it. Just know that because I don't read one of those is harder than the other. Good reading. Excellent. All right.
