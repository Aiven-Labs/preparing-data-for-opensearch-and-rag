Hello beautiful humans Welcome to another episode of Teach Shantek with Laura and Laura is one of our first series that we've been doing of she's been teaching me Python and I haven't really been coding in the last two weeks like I think I had two other episodes the week you and I talked and then last week was conference week so Like I have to get re into this world now
Welcome to another episode of Teach Shantek with Laura and Laura is one of our first series that we've been doing of she's been teaching me Python and I haven't really been coding in the last two weeks like I think I had two other episodes the week you and I talked and then last week was conference week so Like I have to get re into this world now I'm like church readjust time to readjust But I'm excited that we are back and You know somewhat back to normal. I'm still I feel like everybody knows, but I am horrible at social media So I'm I'm posting I'm posting on Twitter right now because I forgot to auto schedule things
I'm like church readjust time to readjust But I'm excited that we are back and You know somewhat back to normal. I'm still I feel like everybody knows, but I am horrible at social media So I'm I'm posting I'm posting on Twitter right now because I forgot to auto schedule things I did a minute ago too and tagged you so I think We're not totally silent Yes Well, hopefully our friends still show up today, but I totally get it if they don't and we don't do this just for them We do this for the learning and people can always watch it post which Is really nice being able to do that because that's what I had to do Have you ever rewatched one of the videos that we've done
I did a minute ago too and tagged you so I think We're not totally silent Yes Well, hopefully our friends still show up today, but I totally get it if they don't and we don't do this just for them We do this for the learning and people can always watch it post which Is really nice being able to do that because that's what I had to do Have you ever rewatched one of the videos that we've done That we've done yeah, yeah, I mean I've rewatched parts to make sure that I didn't say anything to stupid You know, it is you know, it is I do I do All right, but I I watch other people's streams after the fact all the time I almost do it like co-working Where like they'll be working on something and I'll be like sort of half listening and like half doing what I'm doing And then they'll say something that's like particularly relevant and whatever and I'll be like Okay, now I'm just gonna watch you for like 15 minutes or whatever and then you know I get that I get that and Yeah, oh that's such a good way of saying it and hello Ben hello, hello I upgraded my mic since last time so helpful hopefully this sound sounds better wow I can't talk that's the mic's not gonna fix that at all
That we've done yeah, yeah, I mean I've rewatched parts to make sure that I didn't say anything to stupid You know, it is you know, it is I do I do All right, but I I watch other people's streams after the fact all the time I almost do it like co-working Where like they'll be working on something and I'll be like sort of half listening and like half doing what I'm doing And then they'll say something that's like particularly relevant and whatever and I'll be like Okay, now I'm just gonna watch you for like 15 minutes or whatever and then you know I get that I get that and Yeah, oh that's such a good way of saying it and hello Ben hello, hello I upgraded my mic since last time so helpful hopefully this sound sounds better wow I can't talk that's the mic's not gonna fix that at all That's just that's all me and Yay, I'm glad to hear it. It's a blue Yeti, but it's kind of like an old school one But I'm really excited because the way I have my setup. It's not really in the shot. I've never been more excited The mic is in my shot
That's just that's all me and Yay, I'm glad to hear it. It's a blue Yeti, but it's kind of like an old school one But I'm really excited because the way I have my setup. It's not really in the shot. I've never been more excited The mic is in my shot I don't know why it's kind of I Feel like a little silly, but this one
I don't know why it's kind of I Feel like a little silly, but this one It's a little bit in the shot But I could get it like I could lower it But then it wouldn't sound quite as good or I could change my camera angle But I really like the pictures over my head and so I don't Like your camera angle because I always compliment you for your background and what up homie or should I say Ben and Ben
It's a little bit in the shot But I could get it like I could lower it But then it wouldn't sound quite as good or I could change my camera angle But I really like the pictures over my head and so I don't Like your camera angle because I always compliment you for your background and what up homie or should I say Ben and Ben Yeah, but thank you for for commenting the upgrade My boss over at gravity actually was like Oh I can't hear you now did something happen on my end or here's actually it looks like you're muted Can you hear me now? Yes, and the mute symbol is gone
Yeah, but thank you for for commenting the upgrade My boss over at gravity actually was like Oh I can't hear you now did something happen on my end or here's actually it looks like you're muted Can you hear me now? Yes, and the mute symbol is gone So is it the same quality? Maybe I'm not very good at that It just said that my mic went offline and I'm like I didn't even do anything
So is it the same quality? Maybe I'm not very good at that It just said that my mic went offline and I'm like I didn't even do anything Oh But I wonder if it's its first day at work It is it is and for all those who do conference life I feel like you probably really really understand Coming back and having to readjust It's not always the easiest Yay and what up yarray? How's it going
Oh But I wonder if it's its first day at work It is it is and for all those who do conference life I feel like you probably really really understand Coming back and having to readjust It's not always the easiest Yay and what up yarray? How's it going How's it going? Yarray was episode number one Which was like three months ago which Mind blowing to me can't believe it's been that long
How's it going? Yarray was episode number one Which was like three months ago which Mind blowing to me can't believe it's been that long I've been slowly well totally procrastinating on Talking but I've been working on trying to clear my screen so I can actually share it Had to move everything to the other screen It's a thing it is a thing it is a thing Anthony would always yell at me about that too So I'm really glad I have learned my lesson but yes, we have a very very blank screen Yes, yarray it has been three months which is so crazy to me Uh, I want visual good studio um Yes, you can subscribe now Ben and Homi really helped me out like figuring that out and Homi was my first subscript subscriber Right bird
I've been slowly well totally procrastinating on Talking but I've been working on trying to clear my screen so I can actually share it Had to move everything to the other screen It's a thing it is a thing it is a thing Anthony would always yell at me about that too So I'm really glad I have learned my lesson but yes, we have a very very blank screen Yes, yarray it has been three months which is so crazy to me Uh, I want visual good studio um Yes, you can subscribe now Ben and Homi really helped me out like figuring that out and Homi was my first subscript subscriber Right bird See if I can talk Hey, we still have the document open Yay, because I honestly haven't done anything since then Mm-hmm which is Sad but true although I don't know what y'all think of like Uh on Going to conferences, but I loved Meeting so many new people it was fun and What up ace Welcome This is uh, this is episode number four I think so yeah, I think so where and you are more than welcome to Check the our older episodes on YouTube we do have a playlist
See if I can talk Hey, we still have the document open Yay, because I honestly haven't done anything since then Mm-hmm which is Sad but true although I don't know what y'all think of like Uh on Going to conferences, but I loved Meeting so many new people it was fun and What up ace Welcome This is uh, this is episode number four I think so yeah, I think so where and you are more than welcome to Check the our older episodes on YouTube we do have a playlist I feel like I should just call this the uh The Laura playlist, but it's technically called the Python playlist. It's a little bit more of an informative name But come on they both work they both work We can do like Python with Laura and then we've got like a bull for the kids
I feel like I should just call this the uh The Laura playlist, but it's technically called the Python playlist. It's a little bit more of an informative name But come on they both work they both work We can do like Python with Laura and then we've got like a bull for the kids Oh that would work that would work But that was totally so sorry I dig it I dig it and Ace still hang out and ask your questions like I'm not saying go back you have to watch those no I I could just barely got started
Oh that would work that would work But that was totally so sorry I dig it I dig it and Ace still hang out and ask your questions like I'm not saying go back you have to watch those no I I could just barely got started Yeah, I have to go back and figure out half of it as well and also Thank you y'all for being a subscriber Yay Thank you But what we're getting back into and Laura gave me the the option Last time is do I want to I'm gonna get this over here too
Yeah, I have to go back and figure out half of it as well and also Thank you y'all for being a subscriber Yay Thank you But what we're getting back into and Laura gave me the the option Last time is do I want to I'm gonna get this over here too Do I want to do the quiz then or Do I want to do the quiz when we come back Past me was very very Wanting to do it now Future me present me We're gonna see because I I went back to oh here is also Do do do do do do do do do do Ace this is what we've been using is a website slash book called Automate the boring stuff
Do I want to do the quiz then or Do I want to do the quiz when we come back Past me was very very Wanting to do it now Future me present me We're gonna see because I I went back to oh here is also Do do do do do do do do do do Ace this is what we've been using is a website slash book called Automate the boring stuff It's been written for newbie programmers So not even just like new to Python
It's been written for newbie programmers So not even just like new to Python It's new to everyone um and I just thank you What we're working on which is chapter one but there is an intro chapter that helps you download everything I don't think it showed setting up VS Python and VS code no I think we had to figure that one out but that's in our last video and And we just followed exactly what the VS code instructions were like we just googled Python VS code and VS codes docs were precisely correct which is always nice Yes I know j will be excited to hear that that they were correct Since he works on VS code Okay, I am scrolling all the way down all this stuff we did all of it we are to the quiz and for Anyone who who geeks out about like learning theory like the theory of learning and so on spaced repetition um is the way to go and And doing doing the quiz the practice questions here Two weeks later
It's new to everyone um and I just thank you What we're working on which is chapter one but there is an intro chapter that helps you download everything I don't think it showed setting up VS Python and VS code no I think we had to figure that one out but that's in our last video and And we just followed exactly what the VS code instructions were like we just googled Python VS code and VS codes docs were precisely correct which is always nice Yes I know j will be excited to hear that that they were correct Since he works on VS code Okay, I am scrolling all the way down all this stuff we did all of it we are to the quiz and for Anyone who who geeks out about like learning theory like the theory of learning and so on spaced repetition um is the way to go and And doing doing the quiz the practice questions here Two weeks later I mean probably a few weeks I mean not a few weeks like a few days or a week would be optimal But we don't live in the optimal world we live in the real world and we do this every two weeks And so it's going to be two and that's fine Um doing it like this will will helps um Really cement that learning much better than if we had just done it at the end of the last show Yes And as I see uh you downloaded Python oh I love python pycharmus my IDE of choice for for python sweet So as asked us questions as we go along I am going to see Which of the following are operators and which are values Mm-hmm Mm-hmm Wow So I'm pretty sure hello negative Wait our values only numbers I'm cheating I'm going back up The teacher in me is like wait wait wait don't don't do it yet Okay, okay This is why I appreciate that she's a teacher Yep, yep, um oh yeah, so I forgot I guess I never introduced myself on this stream Hi, I'm Laura I'm a technical writer at Suborbital Software Systems And till December though, I mean yeah, like it's less than a year ago
I mean probably a few weeks I mean not a few weeks like a few days or a week would be optimal But we don't live in the optimal world we live in the real world and we do this every two weeks And so it's going to be two and that's fine Um doing it like this will will helps um Really cement that learning much better than if we had just done it at the end of the last show Yes And as I see uh you downloaded Python oh I love python pycharmus my IDE of choice for for python sweet So as asked us questions as we go along I am going to see Which of the following are operators and which are values Mm-hmm Mm-hmm Wow So I'm pretty sure hello negative Wait our values only numbers I'm cheating I'm going back up The teacher in me is like wait wait wait don't don't do it yet Okay, okay This is why I appreciate that she's a teacher Yep, yep, um oh yeah, so I forgot I guess I never introduced myself on this stream Hi, I'm Laura I'm a technical writer at Suborbital Software Systems And till December though, I mean yeah, like it's less than a year ago I was still a math professor Um, and I thought I was going to be a data scientist after that So I was learning Python and so on and then I ended up deciding to go into devrol instead But I still I still love me the Python
I was still a math professor Um, and I thought I was going to be a data scientist after that So I was learning Python and so on and then I ended up deciding to go into devrol instead But I still I still love me the Python It's still my favorite language um to code in And so here we are and so the teacher in me says students Don't trust themselves And so the moment that what we as when we're in student mode and this is true for me to the moment that we're like Mm-hmm
It's still my favorite language um to code in And so here we are and so the teacher in me says students Don't trust themselves And so the moment that what we as when we're in student mode and this is true for me to the moment that we're like Mm-hmm I don't know is that correct our instinct is to go find out like ask someone who knows you know what I mean um and but Also in terms of like the theory of learning the the struggle to like make the connections Those are the connections, right
I don't know is that correct our instinct is to go find out like ask someone who knows you know what I mean um and but Also in terms of like the theory of learning the the struggle to like make the connections Those are the connections, right That's what we're here for and so if the way that we make the connection is by going back in like Looking at what so just like casting our eyes upon the answer rather than figuring out What would make sense here
That's what we're here for and so if the way that we make the connection is by going back in like Looking at what so just like casting our eyes upon the answer rather than figuring out What would make sense here We are depriving ourselves of the learning that we think that we're here to do And we're also not trusting ourselves because usually students know a lot more than they think they do Off-sote box um, I want to add to your soap box of Yerre said Hi, Laura glad to see a teacher in devrol and here sharing knowledge about learning theory too um Yes, I agree with all of that and this is where I personally just want to add in I How to say this I have a love hate relationship with People like Laura In the fact that I get really frustrated and I'm like I want to do the easy way yay When I have people around that are like nope We're just gonna do it and even when they suggest I do it not necessarily like they're telling me or anything like that I'm like Okay, cool
We are depriving ourselves of the learning that we think that we're here to do And we're also not trusting ourselves because usually students know a lot more than they think they do Off-sote box um, I want to add to your soap box of Yerre said Hi, Laura glad to see a teacher in devrol and here sharing knowledge about learning theory too um Yes, I agree with all of that and this is where I personally just want to add in I How to say this I have a love hate relationship with People like Laura In the fact that I get really frustrated and I'm like I want to do the easy way yay When I have people around that are like nope We're just gonna do it and even when they suggest I do it not necessarily like they're telling me or anything like that I'm like Okay, cool I'll do it this way and Also as uh to the part about the trusting thing I personally personal opinion over here think a lot of it has to do with School in the fact that if we failed a test it wasn't a learning opportunity It was a an opportunity to be punished and Was a winning opportunity in my class Just for the first time anyway, so uh I appreciate the call out and I completely agree it so and I know for you it is a learning opportunity Not a moment for punishment and If y'all make fun of me for these I'll just boot you off our stream Yep, no well, I mean most people don't really make fun of each other here and I really appreciate that It's a really safe space to learn but Yeah All right, well if I remember the following are Which of the following are operators and which of the following are values
I'll do it this way and Also as uh to the part about the trusting thing I personally personal opinion over here think a lot of it has to do with School in the fact that if we failed a test it wasn't a learning opportunity It was a an opportunity to be punished and Was a winning opportunity in my class Just for the first time anyway, so uh I appreciate the call out and I completely agree it so and I know for you it is a learning opportunity Not a moment for punishment and If y'all make fun of me for these I'll just boot you off our stream Yep, no well, I mean most people don't really make fun of each other here and I really appreciate that It's a really safe space to learn but Yeah All right, well if I remember the following are Which of the following are operators and which of the following are values I would say operators are the Multiplication symbol the star the Subscription the divide and the plus And the rest I think that Because there are any order of operations Um Yeah, okay, order of operations
I would say operators are the Multiplication symbol the star the Subscription the divide and the plus And the rest I think that Because there are any order of operations Um Yeah, okay, order of operations No, no, no, I know what you mean Yeah, not not in the order of the order of operations, but they're in the like capital O order of operations. Yes Yeah, right
No, no, no, I know what you mean Yeah, not not in the order of the order of operations, but they're in the like capital O order of operations. Yes Yeah, right Okay, so that's completely true Um, they could have been different operators that weren't in the capital O order of operations But when we think about the word operator like it means a thing, right operators they operate on Something right they do something to a value So when you're multiplying of and two two numbers you're doing something to them If you are printing a string you're doing something to that string Right, if you are subtracting if you're dividing if you're adding you're doing something you're operating upon Operators operate upon so it's not just because these happen to be The symbols that we use for mathematical operations
Okay, so that's completely true Um, they could have been different operators that weren't in the capital O order of operations But when we think about the word operator like it means a thing, right operators they operate on Something right they do something to a value So when you're multiplying of and two two numbers you're doing something to them If you are printing a string you're doing something to that string Right, if you are subtracting if you're dividing if you're adding you're doing something you're operating upon Operators operate upon so it's not just because these happen to be The symbols that we use for mathematical operations I mean some of the symbols that we use for mathematical operations Um, but also because they actually operate upon And the others have to be values because they can't like hello the string hello
I mean some of the symbols that we use for mathematical operations Um, but also because they actually operate upon And the others have to be values because they can't like hello the string hello Can that operate upon anything No, but I was going to say can it be a value since it's not a number So The quest the wording of this question I think is strategic and brilliant Because it prompts the reader to ask exactly the question that you just did Can a string be a value because like in colloquial English we think of values as Numbers although we also think of values as like Things that are important right in English
Can that operate upon anything No, but I was going to say can it be a value since it's not a number So The quest the wording of this question I think is strategic and brilliant Because it prompts the reader to ask exactly the question that you just did Can a string be a value because like in colloquial English we think of values as Numbers although we also think of values as like Things that are important right in English We use values in in value in mission statement values First of all, yeah, absolutely
We use values in in value in mission statement values First of all, yeah, absolutely Yeah, it's something that is sort of Yeah, sort of considered important or whatever um, but Yeah, so here they say which of he says Alice Wigart who wrote this in his brilliant says Which of the following are operators and which are values
Yeah, it's something that is sort of Yeah, sort of considered important or whatever um, but Yeah, so here they say which of he says Alice Wigart who wrote this in his brilliant says Which of the following are operators and which are values So there are only two possibilities for each one of these things It's either an operator or it's a value and so we feel pretty intuitively confident that the two numbers Those are definitely values and then we ask ourselves exactly like you did, but hello
So there are only two possibilities for each one of these things It's either an operator or it's a value and so we feel pretty intuitively confident that the two numbers Those are definitely values and then we ask ourselves exactly like you did, but hello Is that a value? Well, is it closer to being of value or is it closer to being an operator since it has to be one of those I Still say value because it's not going to operate on something
Is that a value? Well, is it closer to being of value or is it closer to being an operator since it has to be one of those I Still say value because it's not going to operate on something It's not a doctor Exactly, it can't do something to something else and so then that's um That's why this is such a great question because it it sort of prompts us to think about what is a value in like a computational sense Because the computer the computer in fact the string hello Right Because everything to the computer is all zeros and ones Yeah That's gonna hurt my head too much Uh, but real quick Ben said more examples of Programmic operators that Protomatic see this is why I hate reading out loud not you correcting me
It's not a doctor Exactly, it can't do something to something else and so then that's um That's why this is such a great question because it it sort of prompts us to think about what is a value in like a computational sense Because the computer the computer in fact the string hello Right Because everything to the computer is all zeros and ones Yeah That's gonna hurt my head too much Uh, but real quick Ben said more examples of Programmic operators that Protomatic see this is why I hate reading out loud not you correcting me This is totally fine But I'm like I hate really not loud in general. So this is such a great opportunity to do it Ramon has always pushed me to read the comments out loud
This is totally fine But I'm like I hate really not loud in general. So this is such a great opportunity to do it Ramon has always pushed me to read the comments out loud Oh, yes, one Uh Programmatic operators that aren't in the order of operations Percentage get the remainder from a division plus plus add one to the variable and save the new value to the variable less than And this is when we were talking about Lagos right Yeah, that's the one this is this uh Ben so that way you know how I learned this and the way Laura taught me and I really want Lagos now is uh if we have let's say 20 Legos Uh And we're doing the Remainter from a division it would be like how many times can eight go into 20 Legos um And it's how many groups of eight can go into Legos and only two groups can go into 20 Legos and then there would be four Legos left or for the plus plus uh Is when Only two variable or only two groups of eight could fit in 20 Legos That's actually not the plus plus that is um Integer division it's also called the floor Um, but that's that's the one where that's like um it's slash slash it's like division sign division sign Oh, okay, the plus plus just like Ben said is add one to the variable and save the new value to the variable So if you had like x equals five and then you said x plus plus that means add one to whatever value is stored in x And so if five is the value that's that's originally stored in x then x plus plus would add one to five Which is six and it would save that to x so now x equals six That's the plus plus Okay, and What up Ramon and thank you homie I appreciate it and something that I just like uh Realized is we are up to 70 followers and 15 subscribers Congratulations So um and starting in uh next ish month I'm hoping to also be creating more smaller videos by myself Doing some of these and a quicker b-cap of all of these videos because Um, not everybody wants to watch the full live stream Okay, and that space repetition right so that is That is we're gonna feed two birds with one scone right Yes, oh, I like that
Oh, yes, one Uh Programmatic operators that aren't in the order of operations Percentage get the remainder from a division plus plus add one to the variable and save the new value to the variable less than And this is when we were talking about Lagos right Yeah, that's the one this is this uh Ben so that way you know how I learned this and the way Laura taught me and I really want Lagos now is uh if we have let's say 20 Legos Uh And we're doing the Remainter from a division it would be like how many times can eight go into 20 Legos um And it's how many groups of eight can go into Legos and only two groups can go into 20 Legos and then there would be four Legos left or for the plus plus uh Is when Only two variable or only two groups of eight could fit in 20 Legos That's actually not the plus plus that is um Integer division it's also called the floor Um, but that's that's the one where that's like um it's slash slash it's like division sign division sign Oh, okay, the plus plus just like Ben said is add one to the variable and save the new value to the variable So if you had like x equals five and then you said x plus plus that means add one to whatever value is stored in x And so if five is the value that's that's originally stored in x then x plus plus would add one to five Which is six and it would save that to x so now x equals six That's the plus plus Okay, and What up Ramon and thank you homie I appreciate it and something that I just like uh Realized is we are up to 70 followers and 15 subscribers Congratulations So um and starting in uh next ish month I'm hoping to also be creating more smaller videos by myself Doing some of these and a quicker b-cap of all of these videos because Um, not everybody wants to watch the full live stream Okay, and that space repetition right so that is That is we're gonna feed two birds with one scone right Yes, oh, I like that It's not mine. I got it from someone on twitter and it's the bestest Feed two birds which one's go on scone mm-hmm. I like this. I like this. Oh, so I am completely comfortable being Snowflake who doesn't want to say kill in the birds with the stones I want to feed the six
It's not mine. I got it from someone on twitter and it's the bestest Feed two birds which one's go on scone mm-hmm. I like this. I like this. Oh, so I am completely comfortable being Snowflake who doesn't want to say kill in the birds with the stones I want to feed the six I mean, I really like seagulls plus like oh mine mine mine
I mean, I really like seagulls plus like oh mine mine mine Oh, I actually hate birds, but I still don't want to stone them Oh For you all right Which of the following is a variable and which is a string this one is easy a string has the quote marks True Oh, name three data types Uh Is this is this this there is to scroll oh, I was just putting it at the top of the page no, I know Data types mm-hmm integers I Remember what a whole numbers are and um whole numbers are integers um Well, I mean so in terms of Python like Python doesn't in in mathematics We distinguish between whole numbers and integers where whole numbers don't have negatives and integers do and also have zero In programming we don't distinguish between whole numbers and integers particularly I mean, there's like signed and unsigned I suppose but they're like they're just integers especially in Python
Oh, I actually hate birds, but I still don't want to stone them Oh For you all right Which of the following is a variable and which is a string this one is easy a string has the quote marks True Oh, name three data types Uh Is this is this this there is to scroll oh, I was just putting it at the top of the page no, I know Data types mm-hmm integers I Remember what a whole numbers are and um whole numbers are integers um Well, I mean so in terms of Python like Python doesn't in in mathematics We distinguish between whole numbers and integers where whole numbers don't have negatives and integers do and also have zero In programming we don't distinguish between whole numbers and integers particularly I mean, there's like signed and unsigned I suppose but they're like they're just integers especially in Python They are just integers I just remember integers that is the only one like I know It's gonna be in there somewhere. Okay, so what um what comes in in the number 5
They are just integers I just remember integers that is the only one like I know It's gonna be in there somewhere. Okay, so what um what comes in in the number 53 Right what's what's the word that I said after 5 Point 3 point point There's a there's a data type that has the word point In the name and it means that point Pointager That should totally be it right that should totally be it but what it it refers to the fact that it can move it can sort of float point arena floating point floating point I mean that would make more sense that would make more sense but floating points and in in Python as in many other languages They're referred to as floats so they're like ints for integers and float for floating point and there's also What did you what did you call the spam with the quotes marks
3 Right what's what's the word that I said after 5 Point 3 point point There's a there's a data type that has the word point In the name and it means that point Pointager That should totally be it right that should totally be it but what it it refers to the fact that it can move it can sort of float point arena floating point floating point I mean that would make more sense that would make more sense but floating points and in in Python as in many other languages They're referred to as floats so they're like ints for integers and float for floating point and there's also What did you what did you call the spam with the quotes marks Oh strings that's considered a data type Oh Okay law All right Uh What oh wait I scrolled I remember That's sorry I didn't mean to click on that remote sorry about that but I am so glad that you're good Everyone Um we are remote we copied you and we're both streaming to both of our switches to tie Um all right what is an expression made of and what do all expressions do I feel like we're gonna be spending the entire time doing this quiz Oh What is an expression made of A smiley face a sad face a frowny face Maybe a grin This is as opposed to an equation What do we have to have in order to have an equation Where does ev operations
Oh strings that's considered a data type Oh Okay law All right Uh What oh wait I scrolled I remember That's sorry I didn't mean to click on that remote sorry about that but I am so glad that you're good Everyone Um we are remote we copied you and we're both streaming to both of our switches to tie Um all right what is an expression made of and what do all expressions do I feel like we're gonna be spending the entire time doing this quiz Oh What is an expression made of A smiley face a sad face a frowny face Maybe a grin This is as opposed to an equation What do we have to have in order to have an equation Where does ev operations Nope It's actually in the word almost all of this is in the word equation Equals equals we have to have an equals In this case that sort of like an assignment um or or we're saying like something equals something or it gets a particular value That's an equation or or in programming you know either an assignment or um An assessment I suppose But if we don't have that It's an expression just like in math actually X plus five Is an expression Because it has no equal sign X equals five is an equation And that's all there is What do they do I don't get that part What do they do so in programming um if you use an equals sign um you can give a Variable of value Like Uh Like in number six actually so so bacon equals 20 we're saying that we're giving the variable bacon the value of 20 Okay, um if we said like Bacon plus 20 We didn't give it a value we didn't assign it anything And we didn't it's can't return anything either like it can't say like does it's not like an equals equals where that's like does something equal something We'll get to that further further on but anyway an expression is a string like a bunch of code that doesn't have an equal sign More or less it could also be okay for the moment
Nope It's actually in the word almost all of this is in the word equation Equals equals we have to have an equals In this case that sort of like an assignment um or or we're saying like something equals something or it gets a particular value That's an equation or or in programming you know either an assignment or um An assessment I suppose But if we don't have that It's an expression just like in math actually X plus five Is an expression Because it has no equal sign X equals five is an equation And that's all there is What do they do I don't get that part What do they do so in programming um if you use an equals sign um you can give a Variable of value Like Uh Like in number six actually so so bacon equals 20 we're saying that we're giving the variable bacon the value of 20 Okay, um if we said like Bacon plus 20 We didn't give it a value we didn't assign it anything And we didn't it's can't return anything either like it can't say like does it's not like an equals equals where that's like does something equal something We'll get to that further further on but anyway an expression is a string like a bunch of code that doesn't have an equal sign More or less it could also be okay for the moment We're just gonna say it doesn't have an equal sign I'm gonna pause continue past that when you know it still hurts my head This chapter introduced assignment statements like spam equals 10 what is the difference between an expression and a statement and an Reson I think this goes to me not understanding number four to you, but a statement is like what it said spam equals 10, but an expression would be like Uh Five plus five equals touch But it has well, I mean so sort of like that That would still be a statement because it can still be either true or false or like it equals something or it doesn't equal something Because it has that equals sign in it We're gonna play with more of these Let's let's keep going And we're gonna do lots of lots of these things and then it'll it'll like start making more sense But these questions are good for just sort of like keeping little like swirls in the back of your mind to go like hey wait Was that a statement or was that an an expression
We're just gonna say it doesn't have an equal sign I'm gonna pause continue past that when you know it still hurts my head This chapter introduced assignment statements like spam equals 10 what is the difference between an expression and a statement and an Reson I think this goes to me not understanding number four to you, but a statement is like what it said spam equals 10, but an expression would be like Uh Five plus five equals touch But it has well, I mean so sort of like that That would still be a statement because it can still be either true or false or like it equals something or it doesn't equal something Because it has that equals sign in it We're gonna play with more of these Let's let's keep going And we're gonna do lots of lots of these things and then it'll it'll like start making more sense But these questions are good for just sort of like keeping little like swirls in the back of your mind to go like hey wait Was that a statement or was that an an expression Yeah What does a variable bacon contain after it fall Following code runs Bacon is 21 Or 20 because I feel like it wouldn't run this Oh, no 21 because if bacon equals 20 bacon plus one would equal 21 Um Your second intuition was correct Yeah, that because the first one says bacon equals 20 so we are assigning bacon the value of 20 And then what we said was bacon plus one but like in in in the same sense as like In English bacon equals 20 is a complete sentence But bacon plus one is not There's no conclusion like if somebody said to you bacon plus one or or something like that like bacon and lettuce You'd be like bacon and lettuce Potatoes right like whoa, it's gonna come next Nothing changed
Yeah What does a variable bacon contain after it fall Following code runs Bacon is 21 Or 20 because I feel like it wouldn't run this Oh, no 21 because if bacon equals 20 bacon plus one would equal 21 Um Your second intuition was correct Yeah, that because the first one says bacon equals 20 so we are assigning bacon the value of 20 And then what we said was bacon plus one but like in in in the same sense as like In English bacon equals 20 is a complete sentence But bacon plus one is not There's no conclusion like if somebody said to you bacon plus one or or something like that like bacon and lettuce You'd be like bacon and lettuce Potatoes right like whoa, it's gonna come next Nothing changed Okay, the bacon All right, uh And what should the following two expressions? Evaluate to Uh spam plus spam spam and spam times three So The first one wouldn't it be spam spam spam and then Yep Uh, but the bottom one would be Wouldn't it be the same? Yes, fine. Yes. Okay
Okay, the bacon All right, uh And what should the following two expressions? Evaluate to Uh spam plus spam spam and spam times three So The first one wouldn't it be spam spam spam and then Yep Uh, but the bottom one would be Wouldn't it be the same? Yes, fine. Yes. Okay All right Ah Why is egg a valid variable name? Well 100 is in is invalid Because it doesn't say what 100 is assigned to you or doing So the word variable Contains or almost contains the word very right it means that it can change Can a hundred change
All right Ah Why is egg a valid variable name? Well 100 is in is invalid Because it doesn't say what 100 is assigned to you or doing So the word variable Contains or almost contains the word very right it means that it can change Can a hundred change No, nope not a variable and So what that what that means is that we can't assign We can't use a hundred as a variable because it's like the computer would be like no you can't do that because a hundred has to mean A hundred you can't decide that a hundred means something else or else Yeah, okay, that makes sense that makes sense
No, nope not a variable and So what that what that means is that we can't assign We can't use a hundred as a variable because it's like the computer would be like no you can't do that because a hundred has to mean A hundred you can't decide that a hundred means something else or else Yeah, okay, that makes sense that makes sense All right, and then Let's see Uh what three functions can be used to get the integer floating point or string version of a value Uh, I'm gonna ask this question in a different way Okay, if I gave you The number five some for some reason on this stream my favorite number is five
All right, and then Let's see Uh what three functions can be used to get the integer floating point or string version of a value Uh, I'm gonna ask this question in a different way Okay, if I gave you The number five some for some reason on this stream my favorite number is five I don't know why Because it's not like in other contexts. I did it. I did get it. It's five
I don't know why Because it's not like in other contexts. I did it. I did get it. It's five So if I give you the number five Um, what data type is the number five Of those and ensure an integer it's an integer right what if I gave you the number five But you needed it to be a floating point number which means you needed it to be five point zero Okay Then you could use um a Function and they all work the same way so I'm gonna tell you how the first one works and then you can extrapolate from that What you would do for the second two Okay, so I'm gonna say if we have the number five and we want to make it a floating point number then what we would type is Float and then in parentheses five and so the the float with the parentheses That means this is a function that takes Inputs and turns them into floating point numbers So if I give it the number five it would say okay, well, that's an integer But the the decimal version of that integer the floating point version of that integer is five point zero So here you go
So if I give you the number five Um, what data type is the number five Of those and ensure an integer it's an integer right what if I gave you the number five But you needed it to be a floating point number which means you needed it to be five point zero Okay Then you could use um a Function and they all work the same way so I'm gonna tell you how the first one works and then you can extrapolate from that What you would do for the second two Okay, so I'm gonna say if we have the number five and we want to make it a floating point number then what we would type is Float and then in parentheses five and so the the float with the parentheses That means this is a function that takes Inputs and turns them into floating point numbers So if I give it the number five it would say okay, well, that's an integer But the the decimal version of that integer the floating point version of that integer is five point zero So here you go Here's five point zero So it would just be like integer equals the number or um It would be more like if you wanted it like uh if you like To stick with these variables like if you said spam equals five But then what you wanted was the floating point version of it then you could say spam equals float with five and parentheses And then if you put into the value of spam it would be five point zero instead of Then the integer five but if I did like Spam equals five that's the integer five, but if I wanted Bam equals or five equals string of spam Can you do that
Here's five point zero So it would just be like integer equals the number or um It would be more like if you wanted it like uh if you like To stick with these variables like if you said spam equals five But then what you wanted was the floating point version of it then you could say spam equals float with five and parentheses And then if you put into the value of spam it would be five point zero instead of Then the integer five but if I did like Spam equals five that's the integer five, but if I wanted Bam equals or five equals string of spam Can you do that So you can't but strictly because of the question that came before this where five can't be a variable We can't say five equals something that's not five so spam equals five or like a string of print spam plus five in a string will show the print of that string spam plus five equals string
So you can't but strictly because of the question that came before this where five can't be a variable We can't say five equals something that's not five so spam equals five or like a string of print spam plus five in a string will show the print of that string spam plus five equals string Yeah, so that would be you'd have to use a different Function not the float function because float takes integers and turns them into floating point numbers So what you were just saying is you want something that takes Integers and turns them into strings Yeah, and so that one is a different one and that's String except that it's abbreviated to str And we're gonna use these and then it'll feel much more Intuitive as we're as we're using them This in in programming this is called casting and I like it because it it evokes like casting You know a spell or whatever like you turn a prince into a frog, right
Yeah, so that would be you'd have to use a different Function not the float function because float takes integers and turns them into floating point numbers So what you were just saying is you want something that takes Integers and turns them into strings Yeah, and so that one is a different one and that's String except that it's abbreviated to str And we're gonna use these and then it'll feel much more Intuitive as we're as we're using them This in in programming this is called casting and I like it because it it evokes like casting You know a spell or whatever like you turn a prince into a frog, right So you cast an integer as a floating point number and so you wave your wand and you say Avocado bra hmm you are on a floating point number Got it
So you cast an integer as a floating point number and so you wave your wand and you say Avocado bra hmm you are on a floating point number Got it Okay Last Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it
Okay Last Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it String plus 99 plus string I mean Couldn't we fix it by adding variables above it of I have the end equals Two and burritos equals three So when adding this together it would make 104 So I love that so you solved a Problem that was a different one than I'll head in mind But is a totally valid solution to the problem that you were interpreting this as So what you were saying was I can't I can't like this is gonna cause an error Why so what you said was you were you were gonna set variables for like the string
String plus 99 plus string I mean Couldn't we fix it by adding variables above it of I have the end equals Two and burritos equals three So when adding this together it would make 104 So I love that so you solved a Problem that was a different one than I'll head in mind But is a totally valid solution to the problem that you were interpreting this as So what you were saying was I can't I can't like this is gonna cause an error Why so what you said was you were you were gonna set variables for like the string I have eaten equals. What was it to? Yeah, okay And then the string burritos was three yeah Why does that solve The problem Because then they have the number assigned to them so it's mixing it doesn't mix Integers and strings data types. Yeah data types There we go. Okay
I have eaten equals. What was it to? Yeah, okay And then the string burritos was three yeah Why does that solve The problem Because then they have the number assigned to them so it's mixing it doesn't mix Integers and strings data types. Yeah data types There we go. Okay What's another way that we could solve it So that we would still end up with a string Something about the f strings that I was talking about that we technically haven't learned about yet And this um No, actually you would still have to do something else Inside the f string that would work here as well without enough string
What's another way that we could solve it So that we would still end up with a string Something about the f strings that I was talking about that we technically haven't learned about yet And this um No, actually you would still have to do something else Inside the f string that would work here as well without enough string We don't need enough string to solve it So what you were saying was the problem is that I have eaten is a string 99 is an integer and burritos is a string So thinking maybe back to question number nine What can we do to the number 99 the integer? What can we do to make it a string
We don't need enough string to solve it So what you were saying was the problem is that I have eaten is a string 99 is an integer and burritos is a string So thinking maybe back to question number nine What can we do to the number 99 the integer? What can we do to make it a string Just put quotes around it Yes, but what is another way that we can do it thinking about question number nine Put str in front of it cast it you know You are now a string All right Let's give me a headache No, it's just like I I'm glad I'm doing it
Just put quotes around it Yes, but what is another way that we can do it thinking about question number nine Put str in front of it cast it you know You are now a string All right Let's give me a headache No, it's just like I I'm glad I'm doing it It's just like Difficult to do Um, I probably would have given up like 20 minutes ago. So I'm glad I'm doing this live with you because then I can't Um, and I like that homie said go team even learning extra Absolutely. Yep Okay, I'm skipping extra credit. I'm not an extra credit
It's just like Difficult to do Um, I probably would have given up like 20 minutes ago. So I'm glad I'm doing this live with you because then I can't Um, and I like that homie said go team even learning extra Absolutely. Yep Okay, I'm skipping extra credit. I'm not an extra credit I think that's a good idea Um Hey, Bakari What up Bakari and what up I haven't impressed string plus burritos see that makes sense. That's exactly what you said Yeah, they tied it the same time I said it
I think that's a good idea Um Hey, Bakari What up Bakari and what up I haven't impressed string plus burritos see that makes sense. That's exactly what you said Yeah, they tied it the same time I said it Yep, and hello hello hi is it what would we say L-Fend Were Eve or iFend I don't I don't know how to say their name. I hate fonts that don't distinguish between a capital I and an L right which I'm always like I don't I don't know I don't I don't know if it is but thank you
Yep, and hello hello hi is it what would we say L-Fend Were Eve or iFend I don't I don't know how to say their name. I hate fonts that don't distinguish between a capital I and an L right which I'm always like I don't I don't know I don't I don't know if it is but thank you I appreciate the help on it um All right, so we are now going to you If okay is it if fender if I don't know how to say your name properly
I appreciate the help on it um All right, so we are now going to you If okay is it if fender if I don't know how to say your name properly I will get stuck on this so um I'm going to keep scrolling because I will like try to do this way too long um All right, so we are talking about flow control now and I know for myself Just for everybody as a heads up I can only go until 10 after the hour so we're just going to see how far we can get in 30 minutes and you're not irrelevant FYI you are saving it beautiful human that's showing up to hang out with us I just know that I'll get stuck on trying to say names so um that's the only reason but you are not irrelevant All right So uh I think the last sentence of the of the First paragraph is most of what we need to know here Flow control statements can decide which python instructions to execute under which conditions and it works exactly like a flow chart All right, we have here And this made sense so when I was like uh As the heads up y'all something that I've learned to do is work on I learned best by listening as audio instead of reading it as you can see I'm not great at reading now loud either And so I listened to the audio version of this before we get started and one thing I've noticed is this really made a lot of sense But then further on in the chapter it goes to the text version and I'm like It's not visual I don't get it as much you can make it visual though We can get it out we can totally do that Okay So uh But before you learn about flow control statements you first need to learn how to represent those yes and no options And you need to understand how to write those Uh, brand team points as python code to that end let's say and explore uh Bolian Boolean Boolean values comparison operators and bolean operators Named for a mathematician named um, I think it was George bull B-o-o-l-e Oh, here we got We got George right here All right hi George Yeah, and literally all that means is true or false Like that's all that we need to take away from that Booleans are are Ultimately things that are either going to be true or false Okay, I get Okay, this is actually I just want to point out and this is something that I really really appreciate with Are learning with you Laura is the fact that I do get really frustrated in this because especially during the times where it does not Click very easily because that's how A lot of things just kind of work for me and it's very convenient yet struggling through this kind of stuff Uh, I get really frustrated because it doesn't click and I appreciate the fact that you helped me either go Okay, cool we'll get back to it because something in the future we'll go through it or now we're gonna sit here and Duke it out with with the book um So It does make sense when you say that it equals true or false That's kind of what I was getting when I listened to it earlier So spam equals true So if we just type spam it equals true um a traceback which uh So this is this is because of the in number two and like one line above where it says if we just type true Mm-hmm Then it says the name true is not defined That's not about it's not like one together from the first one just just for clarification
I will get stuck on this so um I'm going to keep scrolling because I will like try to do this way too long um All right, so we are talking about flow control now and I know for myself Just for everybody as a heads up I can only go until 10 after the hour so we're just going to see how far we can get in 30 minutes and you're not irrelevant FYI you are saving it beautiful human that's showing up to hang out with us I just know that I'll get stuck on trying to say names so um that's the only reason but you are not irrelevant All right So uh I think the last sentence of the of the First paragraph is most of what we need to know here Flow control statements can decide which python instructions to execute under which conditions and it works exactly like a flow chart All right, we have here And this made sense so when I was like uh As the heads up y'all something that I've learned to do is work on I learned best by listening as audio instead of reading it as you can see I'm not great at reading now loud either And so I listened to the audio version of this before we get started and one thing I've noticed is this really made a lot of sense But then further on in the chapter it goes to the text version and I'm like It's not visual I don't get it as much you can make it visual though We can get it out we can totally do that Okay So uh But before you learn about flow control statements you first need to learn how to represent those yes and no options And you need to understand how to write those Uh, brand team points as python code to that end let's say and explore uh Bolian Boolean Boolean values comparison operators and bolean operators Named for a mathematician named um, I think it was George bull B-o-o-l-e Oh, here we got We got George right here All right hi George Yeah, and literally all that means is true or false Like that's all that we need to take away from that Booleans are are Ultimately things that are either going to be true or false Okay, I get Okay, this is actually I just want to point out and this is something that I really really appreciate with Are learning with you Laura is the fact that I do get really frustrated in this because especially during the times where it does not Click very easily because that's how A lot of things just kind of work for me and it's very convenient yet struggling through this kind of stuff Uh, I get really frustrated because it doesn't click and I appreciate the fact that you helped me either go Okay, cool we'll get back to it because something in the future we'll go through it or now we're gonna sit here and Duke it out with with the book um So It does make sense when you say that it equals true or false That's kind of what I was getting when I listened to it earlier So spam equals true So if we just type spam it equals true um a traceback which uh So this is this is because of the in number two and like one line above where it says if we just type true Mm-hmm Then it says the name true is not defined That's not about it's not like one together from the first one just just for clarification Okay And true can't equal two plus two because that's not a you know i can please make sense yeah Okay, like but Could you do true equals four
Okay And true can't equal two plus two because that's not a you know i can please make sense yeah Okay, like but Could you do true equals four No because it's Okay Right because then it would be like truth is equivalent to the number four which would be odd Not in the mathematical sense of odd Every weird That would be even but um Okay, like any other value uh Boolean values are used in expressions and can be stored in variables one You don't if you don't use a proper case two or you try to use true and false for variable names three Python will give you an error message Mm-hmm Uh, and then we got comparison operators also called relational operators compare two values and evaluate down to a single Boolean value Mm-hmm Okay, I feel like these are pretty common Luckily, yep, yep that double equals um, I think that's just about universal So that means that means is equal to or is like equivalent to um the the exclamation point equals that isn't universal to all programming languages Some programming programming languages do it with like equals and then slash equals Yeah, I mean not equal to I like this
No because it's Okay Right because then it would be like truth is equivalent to the number four which would be odd Not in the mathematical sense of odd Every weird That would be even but um Okay, like any other value uh Boolean values are used in expressions and can be stored in variables one You don't if you don't use a proper case two or you try to use true and false for variable names three Python will give you an error message Mm-hmm Uh, and then we got comparison operators also called relational operators compare two values and evaluate down to a single Boolean value Mm-hmm Okay, I feel like these are pretty common Luckily, yep, yep that double equals um, I think that's just about universal So that means that means is equal to or is like equivalent to um the the exclamation point equals that isn't universal to all programming languages Some programming programming languages do it with like equals and then slash equals Yeah, I mean not equal to I like this I mean it's fewer characters and also because I like calling it bang Um, just I just want to double check Uh ace if you're still here let us know if you have questions so far as we're going through this Um, I know that you're just getting started with Python, but I do want to suggest that you can go through and ask us questions at any point um And that goes for everyone so not just ace ace was just the one that mentioned that they were a bit newer all right, so this Makes sense so it says 42 is equal to 42 True 42 is equal to 99 false 2 is not 3 equal to 3 correct 2 is not equal to 2 false It's not Because it that equation doesn't compute because they are equal There we go In inequality It's not in a quality because then it would be true Equations have to be true Got it
I mean it's fewer characters and also because I like calling it bang Um, just I just want to double check Uh ace if you're still here let us know if you have questions so far as we're going through this Um, I know that you're just getting started with Python, but I do want to suggest that you can go through and ask us questions at any point um And that goes for everyone so not just ace ace was just the one that mentioned that they were a bit newer all right, so this Makes sense so it says 42 is equal to 42 True 42 is equal to 99 false 2 is not 3 equal to 3 correct 2 is not equal to 2 false It's not Because it that equation doesn't compute because they are equal There we go In inequality It's not in a quality because then it would be true Equations have to be true Got it Otherwise, they're inequalities Okay, okay, you're either equal or you're not equal All right, well We will state it if we want to say If we want to use like a single Word that isn't inequality we can say statement the statement 2 is not equal to 2 is false Oh, yeah, okay, so the statement got it Okay, so the statement and then we got Uh, you might expect Equal equal is equal to uh, evaluates to true when the values of both sides are the same and not equal to evaluates to true when 2 values are different The equal and not equal to operators can actually work with values of any data type Mm-hmm All right, and these are all making sense because the second one is false because one letters capitalized Um Oh, it did catch that 42 and the integer of 42 are the same Right, that's what are the 42 and the Yeah, the end point you're in the floating point are the same and These are not the same 42 equals quote 42 because it's in a quote So it would technically create it it would mean it's a string
Otherwise, they're inequalities Okay, okay, you're either equal or you're not equal All right, well We will state it if we want to say If we want to use like a single Word that isn't inequality we can say statement the statement 2 is not equal to 2 is false Oh, yeah, okay, so the statement got it Okay, so the statement and then we got Uh, you might expect Equal equal is equal to uh, evaluates to true when the values of both sides are the same and not equal to evaluates to true when 2 values are different The equal and not equal to operators can actually work with values of any data type Mm-hmm All right, and these are all making sense because the second one is false because one letters capitalized Um Oh, it did catch that 42 and the integer of 42 are the same Right, that's what are the 42 and the Yeah, the end point you're in the floating point are the same and These are not the same 42 equals quote 42 because it's in a quote So it would technically create it it would mean it's a string That's right Oh groovy all right Uh Which this just said all the same stuff we said And then this is where I get mixed up is greater than or less than floating points so so the big end of the Thing points toward the bigger number Okay So if we're looking at like 42 and 100 like just to remember like which direction do these things need to face Yeah, the little end is pointing toward the 42 and the big end is pointing to the 100 Okay, so that's why when the shark is eating the smaller number it's false Maybe going to that um Okay A count equals 42 And then I'm confused why the second line is a count is less than Or equal to 42 So it's saying those two ones because it's less than or equal to it's the or equal to yep Okay, and then my age is 29 my age is greater than or equal to 10 true boy Okay, the difference between the equal equal and equal operators You might have noticed that the equal equal operator equal to has two equal signs while the equal operator Assignment has just one equal sign
That's right Oh groovy all right Uh Which this just said all the same stuff we said And then this is where I get mixed up is greater than or less than floating points so so the big end of the Thing points toward the bigger number Okay So if we're looking at like 42 and 100 like just to remember like which direction do these things need to face Yeah, the little end is pointing toward the 42 and the big end is pointing to the 100 Okay, so that's why when the shark is eating the smaller number it's false Maybe going to that um Okay A count equals 42 And then I'm confused why the second line is a count is less than Or equal to 42 So it's saying those two ones because it's less than or equal to it's the or equal to yep Okay, and then my age is 29 my age is greater than or equal to 10 true boy Okay, the difference between the equal equal and equal operators You might have noticed that the equal equal operator equal to has two equal signs while the equal operator Assignment has just one equal sign It's easy to confuse these two operators with each other just remember these points The equal equal operator equal to ask whether two values are the same as each other The equal operator assignment puts the value on the right into the variable on the left To remember which is which notice that the equal equal operator equal to consists of two characters just like the exclamation point equals operator not equal to consists of two characters Right, so one of them is like equals Mm-hmm one equal sign or equal to two words two equal sign Cool makes enough sense all right I'm gonna go to boolean operators The three boolean operators and or and not Are used to compare boolean values like comparison operators
It's easy to confuse these two operators with each other just remember these points The equal equal operator equal to ask whether two values are the same as each other The equal operator assignment puts the value on the right into the variable on the left To remember which is which notice that the equal equal operator equal to consists of two characters just like the exclamation point equals operator not equal to consists of two characters Right, so one of them is like equals Mm-hmm one equal sign or equal to two words two equal sign Cool makes enough sense all right I'm gonna go to boolean operators The three boolean operators and or and not Are used to compare boolean values like comparison operators They evaluate these expressions down to a boolean value Uh binary boolean operators And we remember binary it's just meaning two means there are two things So we're just comparing these two things Okay The and And or operators always take two boolean values or expressions so they are considered binary operators That's how we got to Okay, and the The the and operator evaluates an expression to true if both boolean values are true Otherwise it evaluates to false enter some expressions using and Into the interactive shell to see an action Let's scroll down a bit because I feel like these aren't necessarily the most informative Let's let's just get a sense for all these um operators There we go So here we are so we're mixing the boolean and comparison operators Which is the thing that we could do you know
They evaluate these expressions down to a boolean value Uh binary boolean operators And we remember binary it's just meaning two means there are two things So we're just comparing these two things Okay The and And or operators always take two boolean values or expressions so they are considered binary operators That's how we got to Okay, and the The the and operator evaluates an expression to true if both boolean values are true Otherwise it evaluates to false enter some expressions using and Into the interactive shell to see an action Let's scroll down a bit because I feel like these aren't necessarily the most informative Let's let's just get a sense for all these um operators There we go So here we are so we're mixing the boolean and comparison operators Which is the thing that we could do you know So yeah four is less than five and five is less than six so and Works exactly like we want it to do two if you say like um Laura is a technical writer and Laura knows Python like it has that's only a true statement if both Laura is a technical writer and Laura knows Python are true Can Can you use a boolean operators For strings as well as numbers Not without bringing in some functions maybe Because like it wouldn't like if you said Laura and Jen There's sort of no way to assess whether that's true or false Right if you said Laura and Jen have met in real life You know then that's something that you can assess um but the and in that sentence is not In the is not I mean yeah I'm not saying that super well, but like it's that's you'd have to bring in something else you have to add something to it Okay, and on that point So or Is at least one of them has to be true Yeah, so And it's saying that the two Is equal to two Right At least that's why that one to be true Okay And then it can both be true
So yeah four is less than five and five is less than six so and Works exactly like we want it to do two if you say like um Laura is a technical writer and Laura knows Python like it has that's only a true statement if both Laura is a technical writer and Laura knows Python are true Can Can you use a boolean operators For strings as well as numbers Not without bringing in some functions maybe Because like it wouldn't like if you said Laura and Jen There's sort of no way to assess whether that's true or false Right if you said Laura and Jen have met in real life You know then that's something that you can assess um but the and in that sentence is not In the is not I mean yeah I'm not saying that super well, but like it's that's you'd have to bring in something else you have to add something to it Okay, and on that point So or Is at least one of them has to be true Yeah, so And it's saying that the two Is equal to two Right At least that's why that one to be true Okay And then it can both be true That's okay Okay, but it has to be at least one of them
That's okay Okay, but it has to be at least one of them There is something else called an exclusive or which means Either this or that but not both Okay, we're not we're not worrying about that at the moment Okay Oh I feel like this is like the the what I've always hated about trying to figure out excel just in case anybody was curious Absolutely, this is This is what I did not like about excel But it like it makes sense, but then it doesn't make enough sense, but this is teaching me this is teaching me the ways All right So if Four is less than five and five is less than six Then it's true Yeah, both of those are true statements four is less than five and also five is less than six So that's true So we wouldn't I guess like I get that there that this is an image to like Describe it, but I feel like this true and five is Less than six makes it very confusing like why did that one drop down but the first one didn't drop down so if I just like Skip this line
There is something else called an exclusive or which means Either this or that but not both Okay, we're not we're not worrying about that at the moment Okay Oh I feel like this is like the the what I've always hated about trying to figure out excel just in case anybody was curious Absolutely, this is This is what I did not like about excel But it like it makes sense, but then it doesn't make enough sense, but this is teaching me this is teaching me the ways All right So if Four is less than five and five is less than six Then it's true Yeah, both of those are true statements four is less than five and also five is less than six So that's true So we wouldn't I guess like I get that there that this is an image to like Describe it, but I feel like this true and five is Less than six makes it very confusing like why did that one drop down but the first one didn't drop down so if I just like Skip this line It's true and true. Yep
It's true and true. Yep Okay Which makes it all because that's the so what he says is you can think of the computers evaluation process It's literally because the the the one that the computer is going to consider first is the one that is written first on the left Four is less than five so it's going to consider is this true because if it's not we can stop here We don't need to consider the second one if the first one is false Yeah, but if it were an or because or is at least one but and is both So if the first one is false, we don't even care whether the second one is true or false Got it and I'm gonna pace this in here This is the link we're using for anybody that wants to fall long I know we're going through a lot of theory before doing it on um coding and Yes, yes, I agree
Okay Which makes it all because that's the so what he says is you can think of the computers evaluation process It's literally because the the the one that the computer is going to consider first is the one that is written first on the left Four is less than five so it's going to consider is this true because if it's not we can stop here We don't need to consider the second one if the first one is false Yeah, but if it were an or because or is at least one but and is both So if the first one is false, we don't even care whether the second one is true or false Got it and I'm gonna pace this in here This is the link we're using for anybody that wants to fall long I know we're going through a lot of theory before doing it on um coding and Yes, yes, I agree It's important to understand how the computer will interpret the code. Yep Um It's definitely something that I think Yeah, you're all right. It's just not the way my brain like read it varies Right
It's important to understand how the computer will interpret the code. Yep Um It's definitely something that I think Yeah, you're all right. It's just not the way my brain like read it varies Right Yeah, it's because we're not reading all of the words that I'll read Yeah, because if we had read the words that I'll wrote then we would be seeing You can get that's true. That is very true That is very true
Yeah, it's because we're not reading all of the words that I'll read Yeah, because if we had read the words that I'll wrote then we would be seeing You can get that's true. That is very true That is very true This is not helpful No, no, not at all and I do want to say that I appreciate the way we're going through this because Me trying to read from a textbook is I find it very very difficult like even when I had like if I listen to this beforehand It's a lot easier to comprehend even if I don't comprehend it all then So I totally get that um You can also use multiple uh Bull now I forgot how to say it bullian Boolean Boolean operators in an expression along with comparison operators So Let's skip this part Okay Sounds good to me I did it Um, but I mean I do think this makes sense um just as uh Apparently, I don't want to skip but I really wanted to say it just makes sense in the fact that In my mind you would have to do like The first group of numbers the second group of numbers the third group of numbers and do they equal This does the first group not equal the second group and does it equal the third group Um So yes, but not strictly in the way that I'm hearing the words okay Because it's not that we're asking if two plus two is equal to four if that is equal to the second group Uh, or if that is equal to the third group
This is not helpful No, no, not at all and I do want to say that I appreciate the way we're going through this because Me trying to read from a textbook is I find it very very difficult like even when I had like if I listen to this beforehand It's a lot easier to comprehend even if I don't comprehend it all then So I totally get that um You can also use multiple uh Bull now I forgot how to say it bullian Boolean Boolean operators in an expression along with comparison operators So Let's skip this part Okay Sounds good to me I did it Um, but I mean I do think this makes sense um just as uh Apparently, I don't want to skip but I really wanted to say it just makes sense in the fact that In my mind you would have to do like The first group of numbers the second group of numbers the third group of numbers and do they equal This does the first group not equal the second group and does it equal the third group Um So yes, but not strictly in the way that I'm hearing the words okay Because it's not that we're asking if two plus two is equal to four if that is equal to the second group Uh, or if that is equal to the third group I mean we sort of are in the sense that two plus two is equal to four That evaluates to the value true And because it's asking and not the second group which is false so true and false and true um And so it's just that sort of why it's not that we're asking so much if the first group is equal to the third group or the second group So much as we're just trying to string together Is the first statement true the second statement false and the third statement true Got it
I mean we sort of are in the sense that two plus two is equal to four That evaluates to the value true And because it's asking and not the second group which is false so true and false and true um And so it's just that sort of why it's not that we're asking so much if the first group is equal to the third group or the second group So much as we're just trying to string together Is the first statement true the second statement false and the third statement true Got it Okay. Okay, and if that's the case then this whole thing is true. Yeah I will say and I noticed we only have like 10 minutes left
Okay. Okay, and if that's the case then this whole thing is true. Yeah I will say and I noticed we only have like 10 minutes left I feel like would this be a good breaking point The elements of flow control Just trying to I think we can I think we can do the if and the else But I want to start with that flow chart Okay, and go backwards or maybe even go backwards Let me let me go to the scrolls
I feel like would this be a good breaking point The elements of flow control Just trying to I think we can I think we can do the if and the else But I want to start with that flow chart Okay, and go backwards or maybe even go backwards Let me let me go to the scrolls Yeah, uh, so this flow chart says so if the the if statements clause so so if we just read this without any other context we who have Learned how to read flow charts We Say we go to start and then what would be the next word that you would say
Yeah, uh, so this flow chart says so if the the if statements clause so so if we just read this without any other context we who have Learned how to read flow charts We Say we go to start and then what would be the next word that you would say Yeah after start go to does name Equal Alice Yeah, so if Name is equal to Alice if name is equal to Alice
Yeah after start go to does name Equal Alice Yeah, so if Name is equal to Alice if name is equal to Alice Okay
Okay Yep then then print high Alice if I if not print or false don't do any yeah, and so in code if not is else So if name is equal to Alice if I if that is true then we're going to print high Alice else Stop here Okay, and those are if else statements Okay, that's where a lot of the flow control is going to happen if this Then that else Other thing Okay, and that makes sense
Yep then then print high Alice if I if not print or false don't do any yeah, and so in code if not is else So if name is equal to Alice if I if that is true then we're going to print high Alice else Stop here Okay, and those are if else statements Okay, that's where a lot of the flow control is going to happen if this Then that else Other thing Okay, and that makes sense Yep Let's let's keep going so we just we just basically covered the if and the else let's let's we're gonna just Live on the statement
Yep Let's let's keep going so we just we just basically covered the if and the else let's let's we're gonna just Live on the statement Yeah, so else print hello stranger I like it all right So that's where they put uh if Name Is equal to Alice is true print high Alice if false or else print hello stranger And then after both of those right exactly Okay Elif statements Else if which is abbreviated Elif Elif or elif or whatever But we read it out loud as else if else if that's like OSS
Yeah, so else print hello stranger I like it all right So that's where they put uh if Name Is equal to Alice is true print high Alice if false or else print hello stranger And then after both of those right exactly Okay Elif statements Else if which is abbreviated Elif Elif or elif or whatever But we read it out loud as else if else if that's like OSS It's like if you say it you say Open source, but if you type it it's OSS, which is open source software Yeah Why I don't know whoever comes up with naming conventions like Please please explain to me um, okay, so else if statements While only one of the if or else clauses will execute you may have a case where you want to have One of many possible clauses to execute Let's let's see it in the code And the in the chart even better
It's like if you say it you say Open source, but if you type it it's OSS, which is open source software Yeah Why I don't know whoever comes up with naming conventions like Please please explain to me um, okay, so else if statements While only one of the if or else clauses will execute you may have a case where you want to have One of many possible clauses to execute Let's let's see it in the code And the in the chart even better Yeah, okay Like I get what this is doing the reason I'm a bit like Like confused If name is Alice or equal to Alice is true print high Alice if false If age is Less than 12 True Print you are not Alice kiddo and I guess I'm a bit confused because those two like don't even go together Okay, so let's change it in our in our minds
Yeah, okay Like I get what this is doing the reason I'm a bit like Like confused If name is Alice or equal to Alice is true print high Alice if false If age is Less than 12 True Print you are not Alice kiddo and I guess I'm a bit confused because those two like don't even go together Okay, so let's change it in our in our minds So if name is equal to Alice is true print high Alice Elis if in fact, I thought there's going to be a different else if if we scroll down where it's like Uh Nope Grammy okay like it does make sense in the fact that like it's it's doing like having it go through And this is something that I Was kind of talking about with excel
So if name is equal to Alice is true print high Alice Elis if in fact, I thought there's going to be a different else if if we scroll down where it's like Uh Nope Grammy okay like it does make sense in the fact that like it's it's doing like having it go through And this is something that I Was kind of talking about with excel It's like it's doing it in else if like it just decided to put numbers with the name Alice Which that's fine
It's like it's doing it in else if like it just decided to put numbers with the name Alice Which that's fine It's just kind of so you can keep doing else if Yeah, and so what this is saying this is saying is in the first one if Name is Alice then we print high Alice, but then we're considering some possible ways That someone could be not Alice So if the age is less than 12 then there that person is not Alice and they are a kiddo Right yes, if the age is greater than 2000 Then they're not Alice and they are an undead immortal empire I did get if they are not Alice and their age is greater than a thousand and then a hundred then you are not Alice granny um It is probably a granny instead of a grandpa because we're in the longer than men Um, but what we notice what's important here is this this flow chart, right
It's just kind of so you can keep doing else if Yeah, and so what this is saying this is saying is in the first one if Name is Alice then we print high Alice, but then we're considering some possible ways That someone could be not Alice So if the age is less than 12 then there that person is not Alice and they are a kiddo Right yes, if the age is greater than 2000 Then they're not Alice and they are an undead immortal empire I did get if they are not Alice and their age is greater than a thousand and then a hundred then you are not Alice granny um It is probably a granny instead of a grandpa because we're in the longer than men Um, but what we notice what's important here is this this flow chart, right So we what is that we it's important That we asked about the age being greater than 2000 before we asked about the age being greater than a hundred Because if the age is greater than 2000
So we what is that we it's important That we asked about the age being greater than 2000 before we asked about the age being greater than a hundred Because if the age is greater than 2000 It's definitely greater than a hundred right Okay, and so so But if the age is greater than a hundred it's not necessarily greater than 2000 If we had reversed the flow of these if we had said if age is greater than a hundred print you were not Alice granny And then put the if age is greater than 2000 print unlike you Alice is not an undead immortal empire Then we would be printing both of those things if someone were 3000 years old Oh Right we'd print both And so we have to think about the order in which these questions need to be asked because if somebody were 3000 Then they would fall into that that if age is greater than 2000 Group and then we would print the thing for the age greater than 2000 and then we would proceed directly to end But if somebody were 500 years old It would say if is age greater than 2000 no Else if age is 500 is that greater than a hundred yes, so then you are not Alice granny But if we had reversed those then someone who was 500 It would ask first about the 500 the hundred and then the 2000 But if somebody were 3000 it would print both Got it got it and that does make sense um Couple comments from our beautiful humans Maybe if you think of it as a maze and you're trying to get to the end Uh each evaluation tells you which way to turn uh To turn on your way to the end
It's definitely greater than a hundred right Okay, and so so But if the age is greater than a hundred it's not necessarily greater than 2000 If we had reversed the flow of these if we had said if age is greater than a hundred print you were not Alice granny And then put the if age is greater than 2000 print unlike you Alice is not an undead immortal empire Then we would be printing both of those things if someone were 3000 years old Oh Right we'd print both And so we have to think about the order in which these questions need to be asked because if somebody were 3000 Then they would fall into that that if age is greater than 2000 Group and then we would print the thing for the age greater than 2000 and then we would proceed directly to end But if somebody were 500 years old It would say if is age greater than 2000 no Else if age is 500 is that greater than a hundred yes, so then you are not Alice granny But if we had reversed those then someone who was 500 It would ask first about the 500 the hundred and then the 2000 But if somebody were 3000 it would print both Got it got it and that does make sense um Couple comments from our beautiful humans Maybe if you think of it as a maze and you're trying to get to the end Uh each evaluation tells you which way to turn uh To turn on your way to the end Yeah agree to kind of a tooth you're an adventure Yes, and I also agree um will be doing typing the codes next week or next time which is in two Mondays because I got to end in like three minutes normally we do this has been a lot of theory Which we normally aren't as theory heavy normally is like a side by side if you catch the um The other ones we've done and I believe I have that playlist right here So let me Eh, what did I do with my twitch so many options there are so many options Uh Laura comes on the show it is python with Laura and she comes every um Two weeks and we go through the beginning stages uh bare basics of python So I would definitely check those out and also put that on your calendar if you're liking the python side of things The rest of the time I'm learning a bunch of theory and java script Yeah, so Yeah, although I do think I have a kubernetes coming on soon and I'm working on the kaphka kubernetes
Yeah agree to kind of a tooth you're an adventure Yes, and I also agree um will be doing typing the codes next week or next time which is in two Mondays because I got to end in like three minutes normally we do this has been a lot of theory Which we normally aren't as theory heavy normally is like a side by side if you catch the um The other ones we've done and I believe I have that playlist right here So let me Eh, what did I do with my twitch so many options there are so many options Uh Laura comes on the show it is python with Laura and she comes every um Two weeks and we go through the beginning stages uh bare basics of python So I would definitely check those out and also put that on your calendar if you're liking the python side of things The rest of the time I'm learning a bunch of theory and java script Yeah, so Yeah, although I do think I have a kubernetes coming on soon and I'm working on the kaphka kubernetes Yeah, I think I also have a kaphka I'm trying to think who else uh I might have some I'm debating I have a guess that's coming on Friday and they're like hey we'll go through whatever you want And I'm like he told me he knows go I'm like I don't even know what go is or does So I'm kind of debating just being able to see a little bit about that
Yeah, I think I also have a kaphka I'm trying to think who else uh I might have some I'm debating I have a guess that's coming on Friday and they're like hey we'll go through whatever you want And I'm like he told me he knows go I'm like I don't even know what go is or does So I'm kind of debating just being able to see a little bit about that I started learning go a couple of minutes ago Yeah, let's go yes Uh, so yes very cheesy. I know and for all of those joining today. Thank you so much. I will be back again tomorrow of same time 9 a.m. Pacific 12 p.m. Eastern and 1600 UTC I believe and Yes, make sure to 17000 is a sub I don't know
I started learning go a couple of minutes ago Yeah, let's go yes Uh, so yes very cheesy. I know and for all of those joining today. Thank you so much. I will be back again tomorrow of same time 9 a.m. Pacific 12 p.m. Eastern and 1600 UTC I believe and Yes, make sure to 17000 is a sub I don't know I need to keep good. Let go on Make sure it's right, but thank you all for joining today. I will see you again tomorrow and make sure to follow Laura on Twitter and twitch and Be back soon. Bye. Bye
I need to keep good. Let go on Make sure it's right, but thank you all for joining today. I will see you again tomorrow and make sure to follow Laura on Twitter and twitch and Be back soon. Bye. Bye
