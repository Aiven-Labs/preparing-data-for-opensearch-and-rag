Oh right that's always fun and hello hello beautiful humans welcome to another episode of Teach Shandhaek and we have Graham the Dev on here today to talk about accessibility I'm curious as we let people join the stream what people thought about our graphic that we posted and accessibility so we'll give some time for people to like no wander in but to get started Graham who are you
I'm curious as we let people join the stream what people thought about our graphic that we posted and accessibility so we'll give some time for people to like no wander in but to get started Graham who are you So yeah thank you first of all thanks for having me on the stream and secondly hey everyone I'm Graham I'm done accessibility now for over 10 years software developer over 15 years but I ran my own business for a lot of that so I was the one who was looking after the developers and they did the hard work and I just told people what to do it's much better way to do it things so you should all do that instead
So yeah thank you first of all thanks for having me on the stream and secondly hey everyone I'm Graham I'm done accessibility now for over 10 years software developer over 15 years but I ran my own business for a lot of that so I was the one who was looking after the developers and they did the hard work and I just told people what to do it's much better way to do it things so you should all do that instead Recently I stepped away from the business about three years ago which daily dev for a while and then this year I have just been having a bit of a float around and everything on the job on to the moment stroke setting up totally
Recently I stepped away from the business about three years ago which daily dev for a while and then this year I have just been having a bit of a float around and everything on the job on to the moment stroke setting up totallydev which is a business around accessibility as a service so yeah that's me in a nutshell but anything accessibility to love it anything performance I also love that that was the main core part of the business that letters upsell the accessibility was all around web performance and low time so you'll often see my my face pop up whatever you ask a question about you know where for example Google lighthouse or page speed insights I did a lot on that one and hey to all the beautiful people who've joined us
dev which is a business around accessibility as a service so yeah that's me in a nutshell but anything accessibility to love it anything performance I also love that that was the main core part of the business that letters upsell the accessibility was all around web performance and low time so you'll often see my my face pop up whatever you ask a question about you know where for example Google lighthouse or page speed insights I did a lot on that one and hey to all the beautiful people who've joined us Yes yes and thank you for the follow and I do want to call it Jason how is it that you just followed like 56 minutes ago that one like WTF. Oh yes. Four Jason already already getting reviews he's only been here 10 minutes
Yes yes and thank you for the follow and I do want to call it Jason how is it that you just followed like 56 minutes ago that one like WTF. Oh yes. Four Jason already already getting reviews he's only been here 10 minutes And yes yes and I just wanted to call out because okay Ben I messaged you about this stream today and then like oh I'm putting myself on blast too and then I'm like talking to Graham afterwards and so I told Ben I've never had anybody on the show for accessibility and I was trying to say I haven't had anybody on the show for accessibility since Ben and then it came back to me telling Graham oh because you've been on the show before and I didn't mean it like that he's just like watched an episode or two that I'm like you know what words and I and I just want Jason to be there as well
And yes yes and I just wanted to call out because okay Ben I messaged you about this stream today and then like oh I'm putting myself on blast too and then I'm like talking to Graham afterwards and so I told Ben I've never had anybody on the show for accessibility and I was trying to say I haven't had anybody on the show for accessibility since Ben and then it came back to me telling Graham oh because you've been on the show before and I didn't mean it like that he's just like watched an episode or two that I'm like you know what words and I and I just want Jason to be there as well I mean by the end of this stream hopefully we'll have offended absolutely everybody and that means it's been a successful stream
I mean by the end of this stream hopefully we'll have offended absolutely everybody and that means it's been a successful stream Do you say? Do you say
Do you say? Do you say Yes that should be the goal that should be the goal and thank you Todd for following and yay okay I'm curious so for everybody that if you didn't see the social media posts about this stream let me show you a few things because we had a question that really set up this stream and also what I learned from Ben I think almost a year ago which is really crazy to me I can't believe it's been that long of is this graphic accessible helps if I zoom into the right screen oh look it has 777 views is it that's kind of fun let's let's let's do that and I will share it right here I am curious what y'all think is it accessible is it not accessible why or why not and just so that way y'all know the alt text is upsetting yes but deliberately so it's it's one of the few times where I I'm happy that you put that alt text on them you know not not going to cry too much about terrible alt text today and I alien no no alien alien alien dude you've been on the show and I still can't say your name properly oh my god I correct myself like seven times still while doing this of um oh we we talked about maybe looking at my website and I'm like well it was a thing that I really broke and never fixed it and rebuilding my site again so I don't know if uh um that's great so we probably shouldn't do that but um and Ben uh oh the bottom text is a little thin for readability sake all right all right anybody else what what was your thoughts Graham I had a similar thought um I did try and do a contrast check on it and ironically it's pretty close to passing there's a couple of light parts behind the text but ideally that that text at the bottom would have been lighter uh lighter and probably had a background behind it that wasn't as fussy because that fussy background could be very off-putting however other than that the image itself is pretty decent the text is a half decent size um there's good contrast on the learning from Graham about web accessibility part you know it wasn't bad your alt text was a bit that maybe cry but deliberately so so you know that's not the end of the world I know why the alt text was not good let's look at the alt text um uh for those who may not know alt text is where when you need to use a screen reader to be able to read what's going on if you're unable to read it and um I bet I know I know I know I purposely I purposely did this one I knew it would make you mad then like it's really funny because like I forgot to tell Ben about the screen until today and also what up cat I was trying to reply and open to switch up in another yeah it's just not working um but yes um alt text is uh for a screen reader for when you want to uh something needs to tell you about what the graphic is or a picture is instead of it just saying this is a picture enough about description not about description of alt text um it's the context of the image and the important information the easiest way to think about it is always to imagine if somebody is blind uh and using a screen reader it's not the only reason why alt text is important but that's the easiest one to understand you need to in context explain all of the important information of that picture we always say imagine you're having a phone call describing in this case the post uh what would you tell people that's important on that image and so obviously the text is important and then you may want to say a little bit about the abstract background but other than that like the fact there's a red background behind the white text is that important no not really so you'd probably exclude that sort of information and thank you for that and y'all I just want to say like life goes full circle because not only do I have uh like Renee hanging out with us from go daddy days which was like dude I haven't worked there since like 2018 2019 but James is here and I knew James in high school and I don't want to say how long ago that was um but we knew each other in high school and it's just really cool how like when you work on well things and life how it can like wrap back around so just want to say hi y'all um and yes that is a great great way of explaining it and what about SEO are you supposed to use it for SEO oh the leading questions that you know that are going to make me upset try to make me angry I like it I like it uh no please do not use your old descriptions for SEO that is not what they are for and to be honest with you it won't even work anymore there was a point in the past where keyword stuffing in your alt text was a thing that would actually work nowadays it doesn't uh so don't do it it's not what it's there for it's to help people who need that information to be able to enjoy your content and also for people who have images switched off people don't think about that but there's a lot of countries out there where data is expensive they may browse with images blocked it gives a description of what that image is so they can decide whether to unblock images if they want to see it or not so that's another reason why you should use alt text to describe the image not to try and stuff 50 keywords in there okay y'all I'm gonna pick apart my own just social media side of things like graphics you should or should not do because I feel like this is a a great way of learning because I I guess before I do this and I'll I'll remove my uh my screen for a second of why like what we're talking to a lot of developers we talk to a lot of people that may be coding but they may be you know just social media in general they may you know just why is accessibility important to all of us instead of just screen readers because all of us end up temporarily disabled um the situational disability that people completely forget about but like bright light on your phone you know bright light shining on your screen I always give this example it's such a good one that everyone could appreciate if you've got poor contrast so for example that texit we will be complaining about that's very thin and not great contrast if a bright light shining on your phone screen you're not going to be able to read that so cooler contrast in that example and enough contrast between the text and the background would mean that in a bright light I've got a better chance of being able to see it um it's also things like you maybe you've got a young child and maybe you're having to work one handed so have you thought about that because that's exactly the same as someone who may be an amputee they have the same disability it's just that yours happens to be situational and um temporary whereas there's this permanent that's the only difference you still have the need you still have the one so accessibility benefits everybody the main thing that's important to remember though is some people need you to think about accessibility and some people they can cope without it you know they'll just look at it later or something and you know I think it's a real shame that we are so far into this world and we still have people who are being excluded just because people don't talk about accessibility and teach it so devs make terrible choices and their choices impact thousands to millions of people so there you go there's me being all getting on my high horse I'm sure I'll be upon it a few more times before the stream's done that is that is okay that is something um so funny enough grandma and I talked about this a little bit beforehand of I think we met in Twitter spaces I've been I've had teach Shun Tec for about a year or a year and a half now and yo it's Yuri what up and Jason what is going on oh um I I'm it's interesting because like something that I learned um that I'm still learning this is not something that is done is when you try to please everyone you please no one and when I first met Graham let or you of Graham I didn't understand his humor so I was like put his wrong with this guy but like now all the but no like it's it's so like I really enjoy the humor and I love that you just like you stick to where you are like who you are because being polarizing like the people that are meant to be like in your bubble are gonna be there because if you're pleasing everybody you're honestly not gonna make yourself or anybody happy and I find that just really funny when we're talking about you going on tainted some things because I'm like I appreciate that that is something I know Graham will do um and why I asked him to be on the show so um oh we could end up on some very large timidest by the time we're done but that's the half the thought of winging it as we go yes this is a very winging episode a lot of them I have like a game plan before him but this one I'm like we got here and sometimes that's like the best you can do it's like the days when you're having a rough day and you just like it's a win just getting out of bed so we're having that kind of stream today and uh James said um they always look at it from the position of that health isn't static good points uh access whether you use it or not now uh benefits everyone helps bridge uh gap between those with or without access with access and those without it see if I can read um which is actually a really interesting thing because I would say Yo Streamyard I am gonna call you out on this it's not very accessible I can't like actually hit the text in here without bringing it on screen and if I wanted to hear the text from screen reader I can't highlight it to do that for me because um I'm dyslexic this is a big one of the episodes with Ben was a lot about screen readers and text to speech and um I just paced those is um and I didn't know there was a difference and be like it's these type of things that also are part of accessibility so all of that said when somebody is building a new site like let's say that they want to build a new site or they want to start looking at key features of anything that they're working on what are some would you say are the five top things somebody to look at when building an accessible site it's an interesting way of phrasing the question uh I'm going to go back a step actually because comment was really interesting because it lets me tell the story of how I ended up in accessibility so I'll take the opportunity to share that story many of people have heard it before and then gives me time to formulate my answer so yeah temporary disability was how I ended up in accessibility I fell down a flight of stairs and hurt my wrist and was looking up how to do you know like control up delete one handed and things like that and came across sticky keys which is you know it's a very simple thing but a lot of people may not be aware of it existed and then I fell into this wonderful world where it's like oh accessibility matters oh there's a lot of people relying it oh wow oh it's interesting as well and that's how I got so invested in it it was literally a trip and like I said it was only maybe six weeks where I was struggling but it's sparked this passion that is now ten years probably that I've been doing accessibility stuff because I realized my code has impact on people and it matters what I do and sticking to standards is important um anyway I got on a tangent with that but I like telling that story because a lot of developers are a lot younger probably have an experience disability that was my uh background in life was I didn't really know anyone with a disability or at least not things that I'd actively thought of as disabilities you know I knew people who were colourblind and you someone who had um I don't know the proper term for it so excuse me here but he had interned legs and had to have them corrected so I did know people who had disabilities I just never thought about it that way and I never really thought about oh how on earth does someone who's blind use a website what how do deaf people interact with you know I have a phone call with somebody these are the things that I just they weren't on my radar because nobody had the very simple thing to say it to me and so that's why I'm now so invested in it it's for me to spread that same message to people who may have no clue and it only takes one person to go have you thought about this and then all of a sudden some people will go oh wow and then they get interested and invested um so that was my tangent to give myself thinking time I like it I like it I if you're open to it I'll give you a few more moments because I think that was something really relatable and we can wrap back to the five top five things okay um okay okay I I think um I feel like that is it it it is very relatable because for many of us and something that a big reason I started teaching on tech was yes to get into dev rel and get some content and learn tech a lot of it was because tech isn't very accessible in general on and we're not necessarily talking about the you know using the technology or those type of things but also the communities around it and the knowledge isn't as accessible and that was something that was very important to me of of wanting to level the playing ground and something that I appreciated then I think it was Ben that called me like told me best by calling me out I mean just like told me this very time there was like um that tech not everything you can't make access everything accessible no matter what like there there's there it's it's something that isn't possible it like and but there are ways that you can change things and taking it one step at a time and and doing what you can a big part of that was um because I had to pause my podcast to be able to keep up with teach shuntek when I was job hunting and then getting my job and having learning that lesson I feel like I see so much more of like the work you do Graham and sticking with accessibility instead of spreading yourself too thin and doing nothing you're focusing on something you can make a difference with and that is a lesson I still struggle with of sticking to like staying focused I have you so fooled if you think that I am very focused on accessibility I try to try to make it the primary thing I talk about but trust me I am like oh squirrel you know and I'll go off and look at something interesting and then I'll come back to it all the time so it's my guiding principle on things that I do but I literally released an article the other day and the solution they think it it was not accessible and there's no way to make it accessible I'm still okay with releasing those things because they are exploring things and I explain what it is but there was no physical way to make the actual end product accessible because I was abusing CSS and doing things you weren't meant to do with it the thing with accessibility is you kind of have to follow the patterns have been established to make things accessible and I was using CSS to build a neural network there was there was no way to make that accessible for people so interesting um there's a lot of layers there what it well okay what were you working on and can you tell us about those like um uh like frame frameworks I don't know framework was the right way that you the right way to say that of how you said that because I feel like that goes into the the five as well right so so first things first like so the article was a dumb silly article it was a it was just a stupid idea I had how far can I push CSS so I've done bubble sort in pure CSS no JavaScript nothing it was bubble sort in CSS and then I thought hey can we push it as a step further can we create a neural network in CSS it's not what it's designed for so that's where the problem is but it gives a very nice parallel with a lot of the problems we have in accessibility which is people will use one type of element and then try and mold it to do something it wasn't designed to do prime example being a div as a button you know people do that all the time or a href equals hash and then that's a button even though it's not a button it's an anchor and it's really important to use the right element for the job so when you go outside of what things are intended for you very hard if not impossible to make things accessible and there was a point that you made there that been ben brought up in every accessibility person will say this which is there is no such thing as fully accessible this is just as accessible as possible within the limitations of technology and also ability you know if you have a course on advanced mathematics and someone has a severe learning impairment you will find that very difficult to make it so that that becomes accessible no matter how hard you try to change the subject matter the subject matter may be something that will never be accessible for that person so our aim is to improve things to a point where as many people as possible can enjoy them whether that's changing formats adjusting the way you approach it using simpler language which is why I brought up the cognitive impairments because so many people like to sound smart when they're writing and don't think of the fact that that's an accessibility issue um so there's loads of elements there and so that breathes us nicely onto what am I thinking about when I'm building a website that was your question a few minutes ago and I don't think so there's where you do you know about WCAG if you heard of the web content accessibility guidelines I want to say yes because Ben was on the stream and he probably told me about it um I don't remember it okay no problem so WCAG there's many ways that people say it WCAG WCAG WCAG WCAG WCAG and it's the web content accessibility guidelines it's a set of the core success criterion which yet again we'd like to use fancy word so load of principles guides on how to make things accessible so for example one of the rules is non-text content which includes images and things like that and controls how do you make sure that people who cannot see the physical item can still access the same information and that's essentially what an alt tegas you know it's it's non-text content it's a picture and your alt text your alt attribute text sorry Todd I said I would say alt attribute text just so there wasn't any confusion um that is there to give a text alternative that assistive technology can use to describe that image that's what it is there for so these 88 rules I'm going to call them as they are now even though they are success criterion guidance are the the founding principles of accessible design I bring that up ironically to say that that's not the way I think when I'm designing something excessively at first they are the thing I think about later the first thing I'm thinking about are different ways that people will interact with a page so I will think about a screen reader I'll think about people who rely on a keyboard who can't use a mouse due to dexterity issues for example and I'll think about how will someone interact with each element on the pages I build it so if I'm building a header for a page I'll be right can I get to that menu with a keyboard yes or no so I'll do a quick tap test and I'll tap round and see if I've made any mistakes especially if that menu has a drop down can I open that drop down menu with a keyboard you'll be amazed how many websites you cannot do that then I'll be thinking about okay have I marked this up correctly so am I using semantic HTML which I hope you have covered at some point but if not we can cover semantic HTML we should probably cover that again because I don't I don't y'all I have over a hundred episodes I've learned a lot over the last year I don't remember it all so I'm saying that as a Ben if you talk me this I am slowly going back and indexing all my old stuff but yeah please please tell us what it is so you probably you're probably aware of it without perhaps knowing the term for it so it seems like using instead of divs everywhere you might use an element like main for the main content of the page or header around the header or nav elements so I don't know if you've come across any of these or been taught around these elements yes I don't know if I've been taught around them as much as using Astro on I've done two themes with it like I built out one site completely and which was you mentioned earlier about having something that you're supposed to not completely like more if into something else I've tried doing that twice once with a theme that I don't know whose theme it was and then I fell in love with aliens theme and also tried doing the same things so I started learning what I'm supposed to be doing with them instead of trying to create a new wheel is that the first
Yes that should be the goal that should be the goal and thank you Todd for following and yay okay I'm curious so for everybody that if you didn't see the social media posts about this stream let me show you a few things because we had a question that really set up this stream and also what I learned from Ben I think almost a year ago which is really crazy to me I can't believe it's been that long of is this graphic accessible helps if I zoom into the right screen oh look it has 777 views is it that's kind of fun let's let's let's do that and I will share it right here I am curious what

then gives me time to formulate my answer so yeah temporary disability was how I ended up in accessibility I fell down a flight of stairs and hurt my wrist and was looking up how to do you know like control up delete one handed and things like that and came across sticky keys which is you know it's a very simple thing but a lot of people may not be aware of it existed and then I fell into this wonderful world where it's like oh accessibility matters oh there's a lot of people relying it oh wow oh it's interesting as well and that's how I got so invested in it it was literally a trip and like I said it was only maybe six weeks where I was struggling but it's sparked this passion that is now ten years probably that I've been doing accessibility stuff because I realized my code has impact on people and it matters what I do and sticking to standards is important um anyway I got on a tangent with that but I like telling that story because a lot of developers are a lot younger probably have an experience disability that was my uh background in life was I didn't really know anyone with a disability or at least not things that I'd actively thought of as disabilities you know I knew people who were colourblind and you someone who had um I don't know the proper term for it so excuse me here but he had interned legs and had to have them corrected so I did know people who had disabilities I just never thought about it that way and I never really thought about oh how on earth does someone who's blind use a website what how do deaf people interact with you know I have a phone call with somebody these are the things that I just they weren't on my radar because nobody had the very simple thing to say it to me and so that's why I'm now so invested in it it's for me to spread that same message to people who may have no clue and it only takes one person to go have you thought about this and then all of a sudden some people will go oh wow and then they get interested and invested um so that was my tangent to give myself thinking time I like it I like it I if you're open to it I'll give you a few more moments because I think that was something really relatable and we can wrap back to the five top five things okay um okay okay I I think um I feel like that is it it it is very relatable because for many of us and something that a big reason I started teaching on tech was yes to get into dev rel and get some content and learn tech a lot of it was because tech isn't very accessible in general on and we're not necessarily talking about the you know using the technology or those type of things but also the communities around it and the knowledge isn't as accessible and that was something that was very important to me of of wanting to level the playing ground and something that I appreciated then I think it was Ben that called me like told me best by calling me out I mean just like told me this very time there was like um that tech not everything you can't make access everything accessible no matter what like there there's there it's it's something that isn't possible it like and but there are ways that you can change things and taking it one step at a time and and doing what you can a big part of that was um because I had to pause my podcast to be able to keep up with teach shuntek when I was job hunting and then getting my job and having learning that lesson I feel like I see so much more of like the work you do Graham and sticking with accessibility instead of spreading yourself too thin and doing nothing you're focusing on something you can make a difference with and that is a lesson I still struggle with of sticking to like staying focused I have you so fooled if you think that I am very focused on accessibility I try to try to make it the primary thing I talk about but trust me I am like oh squirrel you know and I'll go off and look at something interesting and then I'll come back to it all the time so it's my guiding principle on things that I do but I literally released an article the other day and the solution they think it it was not accessible and there's no way to make it accessible I'm still okay with releasing those things because they are exploring things and I explain what it is but there was no physical way to make the actual end product accessible because I was abusing CSS and doing things you weren't meant to do with it the thing with accessibility is you kind of have to follow the patterns have been established to make things accessible and I was using CSS to build a neural network there was there was no way to make that accessible for people so interesting um there's a lot of layers there what it well okay what were you working on and can you tell us about those like um uh like frame frameworks I don't know framework was the right way that you the right way to say that of how you said that because I feel like that goes into the the five as well right so so first things first like so the article was a dumb silly article it was a it was just a stupid idea I had how far can I push CSS so I've done bubble sort in pure CSS no JavaScript nothing it was bubble sort in CSS and then I thought hey can we push it as a step further can we create a neural network in CSS it's not what it's designed for so that's where the problem is but it gives a very nice parallel with a lot of the problems we have in accessibility which is people will use one type of element and then try and mold it to do something it wasn't designed to do prime example being a div as a button you know people do that all the time or a href equals hash and then that's a button even though it's not a button it's an anchor and it's really important to use the right element for the job so when you go outside of what things are intended for you very hard if not impossible to make things accessible and there was a point that you made there that been ben brought up in every accessibility person will say this which is there is no such thing as fully accessible this is just as accessible as possible within the limitations of technology and also ability you know if you have a course on advanced mathematics and someone has a severe learning impairment you will find that very difficult to make it so that that becomes accessible no matter how hard you try to change the subject matter the subject matter may be something that will never be accessible for that person so our aim is to improve things to a point where as many people as possible can enjoy them whether that's changing formats adjusting the way you approach it using simpler language which is why I brought up the cognitive impairments because so many people like to sound smart when they're writing and don't think of the fact that that's an accessibility issue um so there's loads of elements there and so that breathes us nicely onto what am I thinking about when I'm building a website that was your question a few minutes ago and I don't think so there's where you do you know about WCAG if you heard of the web content accessibility guidelines I want to say yes because Ben was on the stream and he probably told me about it um I don't remember it okay no problem so WCAG there's many ways that people say it WCAG WCAG WCAG WCAG WCAG and it's the web content accessibility guidelines it's a set of the core success criterion which yet again we'd like to use fancy word so load of principles guides on how to make things accessible so for example one of the rules is non-text content which includes images and things like that and controls how do you make sure that people who cannot see the physical item can still access the same information and that's essentially what an alt tegas you know it's it's non-text content it's a picture and your alt text your alt attribute text sorry Todd I said I would say alt attribute text just so there wasn't any confusion um that is there to give a text alternative that assistive technology can use to describe that image that's what it is there for so these 88 rules I'm going to call them as they are now even though they are success criterion guidance are the the founding principles of accessible design I bring that up ironically to say that that's not the way I think when I'm designing something excessively at first they are the thing I think about later the first thing I'm thinking about are different ways that people will interact with a page so I will think about a screen reader I'll think about people who rely on a keyboard who can't use a mouse due to dexterity issues for example and I'll think about how will someone interact with each element on the pages I build it so if I'm building a header for a page I'll be right can I get to that menu with a keyboard yes or no so I'll do a quick tap test and I'll tap round and see if I've made any mistakes especially if that menu has a drop down can I open that drop down menu with a keyboard you'll be amazed how many websites you cannot do that then I'll be thinking about okay have I marked this up correctly so am I using semantic HTML which I hope you have covered at some point but if not we can cover semantic HTML we should probably cover that again because I don't I don't y'all I have over a hundred episodes I've learned a lot over the last year I don't remember it all so I'm saying that as a Ben if you talk me this I am slowly going back and indexing all my old stuff but yeah please please tell us what it is so you probably you're probably aware of it without perhaps knowing the term for it so it seems like using instead of divs everywhere you might use an element like main for the main content of the page or header around the header or nav elements so I don't know if you've come across any of these or been taught around these elements yes I don't know if I've been taught around them as much as using Astro on I've done two themes with it like I built out one site completely and which was you mentioned earlier about having something that you're supposed to not completely like more if into something else I've tried doing that twice once with a theme that I don't know whose theme it was and then I fell in love with aliens theme and also tried doing the same things so I started learning what I'm supposed to be doing with them instead of trying to create a new wheel is that the first Yeah no well it works for me even if it isn't the right phrase it works for me okay so we should set back then like semantic HTML is the basis the foundation of making things accessible and the reason we call it semantic HTML is within those elements so like for example main element there is extra information that is exposed to assistive technology so that's the semantics it has semantic meaning so if you have divs everywhere on a page when assistive technology tries to pass that page out it has no information about that page structure it has no idea what different elements are for there here's a prime example so on the left we have our typical div soup which you'll find in a lot of tutorials and all sorts of things on the net and then all right we have semantic HTML and so the difference is when I approach that and yet again the screen reader is the easiest way to explain this for someone to visualize on the left it will just say div span div div div div div div at the end of that do you have any idea what that page is about or what any of the sections is no there's no information there on the right hand side as I go around I have landmarks that I can A understand what that's for so it'll say header I know what to expect in a header I'm likely to see a logo I may see some navigational items brilliant I know what that element is and then I get to a nav amazing there's going to be some links in there maybe a couple of buttons depending on the weird design of the website hopefully mainly links aside okay this is supplementary information so this extra information is vital if you don't have visual information on the screen I can't visually see this layout so I have to be able to conjure it up in my head and so that's what semantic HTML is therefore it's to let me know how to get round a page and the added bonuses once I've got familiar with that page so say this was an application you'd built I can use those landmarks with assistive technology to jump around the page the same as you would like just move your mouse from one side to the other you can't do that if you're using the keyboard so the semantic HTML let's me go right I want to jump to the article I can bring up a list of all article elements on the page and I can jump to one of them so it aids with navigation it aids with familiarizing myself with a page ask me sorry go on yeah it's two parts thank you for explaining because that was really helpful and also thank you for comparing the two visuals because that really helped like put words to the visuals and how alt text may show up what's popping out to me right now is you have like understanding does like header one header two like all of those go into semantic HTML that's like part one but also the other part of it was there was a live screen I had a very random moment where I had like 12 people on my live stream at once I was coding well they were all hanging out and just came on to the stream and I remember her talking about something about like design defaults like mobile like if you click a button it's supposed to react to specific way because the design tools say everybody needs to be doing very similar things that's probably something like designing an iOS app so there are some from Apple especially from Apple there are some very strong guidelines on how certain UI elements should behave and even be presented to an extent that is very closely linked to accessibility because one thing that's a very hard one for people to get the head down is expected behavior so like if I see a certain element and it looks like it's a date picker then it better behave like a date picker if I click on it and suddenly it brings up some new funky design that you've come up with that's really out there and out the box that is an accessibility issue because I and that's for everybody it's just for some people it can be a lot harder like I see a new type of date picker I have to work out how do I jump ahead of you how do I jump back a year how do I get to the next month it's cognitive load so that's why it's important and that's why more than likely I could be wrong they were talking about iOS because iOS has very strong guidance on how UI elements should behave so that people can use applications more easily I could be wrong though could just be an internal design system you never know um I'm googling it at the same time and thank you Todd for what you posted and this is I do want to say that I'm not trying to call out like StreamYard and just like keep throwing them out under the bus I'm trying to use examples because if I click on this link to like try to go to the link I can't actually get to the link from StreamYard I have to like and and you talked about cognitive load and also what the expected outcome is is something that I think I agree a lot of people don't think about because while I'm listening to you if I want to put this on screen I have to make sure Twitch is open in another window then copy and paste it and I'm just like what okay I'm hopefully un-staying up to date with the conversation and remembering what you're saying enough and this is just a great I'm excited to look into this later on and um and I mean I looked at Alex I looked at your comment very very briefly you might have already left which is totally okay I totally get that uh in and out but I'm like for some reason I thought it said like uh see you uh Todd and Jen and Graham and I'm like are we saying that we are like all going on the stream at the same time if we do that y'all we have to have Ben as well um like we could just the four of us could just have a conversation about this I don't know I'm just totally spitballing here but um it's interesting to see all this this does help and I think it is very interesting I also something I noticed about myself is I get stuck on trying to figure something out and I think it's like UX design guidelines or something probably uh yet again a lot of those guidelines will have or hopefully will have should I say a foundation in accessibility because whenever you're trying to design a UX design system um or any principles like that it's the designers got a reasonable amount of the responsibility to consider things like do we have space for visible labels on inputs is the color contrast okay what will the flow through this particular workflow be like have we thought of that do I have uh I can give you a good example when I work at daily dev we had a notification system that we put in so like when you upvoted something or left to comment a notification will pop down from the top a nice little toast that was timed and there was no way to stop that from going away which is fine for most people but if you're using a keyboard and you want to uh you know using a sister tech and you want to get to it in time and you want to read it properly you can't do that or maybe you're in the middle of something at the moment and you want to take the time to read it later so what I brought that up and one of the things the implemented was a option to make it so that they don't auto dismiss very simple but for some people can be very very important because now that person can take their time to read it and especially this is like the added benefit there's an international audience on daily dev where English is a secondary or tertiary language you know third language so being able to have extra time to read things is reassuring for people instead of them rushing through it and going what did that say was that important I don't know so it's this is why I always say accessibility benefits everybody because by introducing that feature it meant that everybody can switch it so that those don't auto dismiss and that could be useful for any reason you you brought up a great thing um with that at least related to my life that um um uh the company I work for is an international company and uh the majority of the people I work with English is not their first language and if there are a lot of uh north american humans on a call we can all talk very quickly because we go English to English it's very easy to jump into it where it can take somebody that English is their second language a bit to translate and then be able to catch up and this made me realize a to give more pauses and b to also uh talk slower yes I still get excited like when I get excited I talk really fast and I know that I still something I struggle with but my grandmother was like you finally learned how to talk slower I was like but not because you said so it was because the ironic thing is I feel very cold out because whenever I'm talking about accessibility I get into my little zone I forget that we're talking to an international in fact I forgot other people were here for a minute then I was just chatting to you and yes I felt cold out like because I was talking very quickly so I'm going to now have to go back into my conscious effort like I do in Twitter spaces to talk more slowly and with more annunciation so I like that point James uh just brought up another good point and I I find this is interesting also for the tools you choose to use um while this is primarily a conversation of text accessibility from their perspective um uh from the deaf uh HOH transcripts and captions when you see video audio content which also helps ESL people as well and I completely agree I think this is something that hits home for me because it was a the cognitive load to be able to use um like a tool that would make this happen will stop could stop me from actually streaming and putting out this content and to try to learn this tool even though I really want that tool to be there and that's something that I think is just an my own internal struggle of I would love to use OBS and paying and there is a lot of like tools out there that are in my mind a lot harder for me to learn and take time to learn and test it out while trying to keep up with just having my streams out there and those type of things and I think that is something that is a really important conversation because it it's something that i'm glad accessibility gets talked about in general because this is what's going to change tools to be made this way overall instead of me choosing between two tools to one that's overly technical to set up and use to one that is just a couple clicks of buttons it's a so I like this conversation because I can give you a good example of where there was a huge improvement and that was on xTwitter so originally trying to add an alt text there sorry ultra-tribute text sorry Todd was like something you had to consistently think about and actively think about whereas they changed the interface very simply to say hey you forgot the alt attribute you forgot to put some alt text on this image and that little prompt has massively improved the amount of alt text out there now unfortunately most of it is garbage because people haven't been taught how they missed the step of telling people how to write good alt attributes and alt text but it was a step in the right direction and it leasing to what you were saying about why doesn't twitch just have something built in where you can press one button and captions are generated on the fly like we have the technology it's been there for many many years it may not be perfect but it's better than nothing and it helps people who a I may want to listen to your stream with you on mute and I know that won't be listening at that point but be watching but you know what I mean so I can still enjoy your stream while I've got your mute perhaps I mean the library or on a train or something and secondly obviously for people who are deaf or hard of hearing it means that they can enjoy your content as well one trick I normally do and I presume using stream knowledge you can do screen captures of particular parts of screens are you able to do that um maybe now that it has the the web layouts like they um when I started using stream yard and couple things to go into that one of um thank you Todd for adding this link in here for a string closed capture this actually goes a bit into um start using it today so it only does twitch video on demands or obs web socket which is something that can be plays into what we were just talking about and how easy it is to start looking at something and see that it has the issue um even though we're like oh this would be really cool and this also takes a lot of time to go through all of them but also this is another thing that I don't really necessarily realize that a tool changed so I can um I don't know let's let's let's share my own obs or my own stream yard really quick and look and see if uh um it does what you're thinking about um gram share okay we're gonna have in separate moment yeah here we go bit of inception so you can like it used to be hopefully you can deal with this for a moment if you see right uh below here um or like at towards the bottom above the mute stop cam buttons that menu there's our three images or whoever's on the stream and then above that I am gonna make gram go away for a second it has the um like different visuals that you can go to and these layouts this is not always been here this is something that is I don't know what it came out but um like enough that something worked and I didn't go look at it better so I can do a new layout and add items but I think it can only do one media slot at a time yes okay so right so yes we have the limitation one of the tricks that I use with OBS and in fact if I thought ahead I could have had this lined up so I could have showed you but try to do it now live streams gonna be in that matter is I use an online captioning service so like it's just basically speech to text I have it positioned on one of my monitors and then I capture just two lines of the text and I put that at the bottom of my image so that I basically have what I'm saying showing as text on the screen that's something called open captions which basically means they're burnt into the video like they're part of the video itself that's one really neat quick dirty trick to get it to work um that most people can do unfortunately I think you might be limited there that you can't do that one a better way is to have actual captions but yes that can be difficult and hard work to set up Todd did send me a link to a service that he uses that apparently will put true captions on the screen something called closed captions which are ones that I can activate or switch off those are real captions at that point um so those are the better ones but open captions are also decent um I just want to call this out really quick too because as you're saying where it can be on the screen at the same time we can share screens differently and I think that's a great call out and a tool that you're talking about if if it can do it live like I'm using the twitch chat just as an example is you can put if there is something that can do it um it can show up here and you can like pop out a window to have it show up at the same time um yeah so there's uh this I feel like I we ended up going yeah we're the tannels you know hey I said we were gonna do tangents but this this is the beauty it's that the thing is that these things only to really take one time to set up and then once you've got them set up you can use them forever and you can change the experience for somebody accessing your stream um in a very positive way so if there is a simple way that we could do it why not because like you said one of the big barriers and it's not it's not as bad as it sounds to say it is well that's complicated you know now some people who are in accessibility advocacy would say that's no excuse but unfortunately that is how we are as human beings you know something seems insurmountable and difficult then it's not going to get done if there are other options there that are easier things that have this better impact for us so it's on I think it's on the companies to make it easier to do live captioning on streams obviously now that you're aware of captioning hopefully and we can do it in DMs after we can work out a way where you can have those on your stream because that would be an amazing addition um that would really level it up and I think not just for people who are hard of hearing in deaf I think everybody would benefit for like me when I'm talking quickly and English is a secondary language they can see what I'm saying on the screen and it helps those people as well understand what's being said I agree with that I I have a follow up question and this is something that comes to using a text to speech a lot I use it quite often with my dyslexia I can really mad at things that don't use that very well um also with setting up new tools and this is something that I think I would love to hear people's ideas for of the cognitive load to try to set something like this up like I've spent gobs amount of hours doing it and like had ask different people for help which is amazing a lot of it is where how to work through and this might be really simple but um how to work through when it's even if you're following the directions it's not working the way it's supposed to I know that sounds very weird but like that is something that in my own limitation like we talked about design tools on a phone if a menu is not working properly and I need to get to that spot on a site and I'm like this is not working it is literally an issue with the website I personally get like so it's like one of the few things that get me angry is tech which is weird because I'm in tech um but it like it like I literally get so few mean because I'm like why is this not working the way it's supposed to be working and this is such a big barrier that I get very stuck and can't move past it and it it feels like those are types of things that show up for me that I'm curious if all of you have suggestions on how to work through that because that's not something that I want to have as my own personal barrier but I think others probably get the same way where it's like it how so first of all um if someone makes things difficult for you through their poor decisions then vote with your feet if you are able to it's the first answer there so if it's literally a website and it's crap find another website that offers the same thing now I know that's not always an option but if that's that's option one like walk away from the people who don't give a crap about user experience find someone who does that is essentially what people with disabilities do all the time they go onto a website it's not accessible they'll find a competitor so nice parallel there second one is if you're getting to a point where you're if I've understood you correctly like your stuck because you can't find the information you're looking for more than anything it's like you know you should be able to get to it but you can't find it the easiest way is to try and find another way to source that information by either asking in public or chat GPT now is actually a very reasonable option to get yeah you know we have to bring it up at least once in every stream find an alternative way to get the information you need to get you passed your barrier because a lot of times your barrier is a tiny little part of a very very large item but that little barrier can be enough to just stop you dead in your tracks for days and days and be very disheartening but honestly the best way is to ask people you know if you get stuck on something and you you know you've put in the work it's not you being lazy like oh I can't find it because you spent 10 seconds like you've tried to find that information ask someone who knows better go hey I've really been stuck on this and that's the only way to get past it the only other thing I say is walk away and come back a day later at the amount of times that fixes me getting stressed out stuck on something and then when I walk away and come back and go oh it's there how did I miss that it's because you're too editing the moment that I find that happens with me I don't know if that answered the question because that wasn't quite good to some points I think it is just like our own individual like we all need to work through that ourselves and something of also remembering to go back to it and that's a big reason that I I really like the way that you mentioned when we talked about this earlier of accessibility is your overall focus so even if you go on different tangents or rabbit holes or like squirrel it is something that you go back to that is your focus and those are overall tools and things that I pay a lot of attention to because to me accessibility goes into also a lot of neurodivergencies that is that I personally struggle with and like being dyslexic for so long and not knowing I was dyslexic I had so many teachers and people tell me that I was stupid when I just don't explain it the same way or couldn't put it together or my word structure is how to say this I forget a lot of words like I will try to I have to explain around the word and even when I try to have a conversation with someone and I'm looking at them this is going to make me tear up but hey it's a good conversation to have it's it's where people don't always realize that I'm having these difficulties and don't make jokes of them but I work this hard on it because other people don't have that access or support and I don't want anybody else to to feel dumb or not like that they can have access and I think it's so important for these conversations because like I couldn't imagine not meaning all of these people but there's so many people that we can't then don't have access and this is just talking around I really super-cry that's awesome um first I think this is my first teach ed and text cry yay that means that means it's a good stream but it's it is so this is the point this is the people don't realize how constant little things add up over time and how you know like like you said like people think in your stupid just because you have dyslexis so reading becomes more difficult writing becomes more difficult doesn't mean you stupid at all it just means that's a particular area or be quite a small area in some ways a large area that you find difficult but there there's so many things that in the world that we don't see you know like like you said nobody's probably aware of the struggles that you go through because you do a very good job of masking that particular thing and we shouldn't have to mask stuff that's the whole thing but unfortunately we're not quite as involved as a scientist we think we're still quite cave managed cave woman-ish in our thinking in a lot of ways and so we have a lot of situations where people get upset because you know people have made dumbness dumbness assumptions and I keep using the word dumb and I shouldn't use the word dumb because that's got a negative connotation but bad assumptions about people based on their own ignorance towards things and I don't mean ignorance in the the malicious intent I mean it's you don't know this stuff so you inadvertently say things that you don't understand the impact they're having like the teacher's story is not the first time I've heard that it's quite horrendous that you started that sentence I already knew where it was going and I was already getting annoyed and upset for you because that's a common thing it's like oh you still go to read and write you must be dumb no it's no it's something that and thank you everyone for your support I appreciate it it's also something that shows up at work and one of the biggest reasons I left a company that Renee and I both worked at it's it's something that shows up so deeply and a big reason that I have my other show shit you don't want to talk about because these these are so important and so integrated together that I I now have to update Roy so Roy Enger is somebody that y'all should just know about in this dope human is helping me rebuild my website for the I think fourth time and I've been doing it on the background and he's been helping me like figure out tags and like categories and things like that and he's like do you think teach young tech and shit you don't want to talk about will ever overlap like no no no no but they do in this instance that's why they're it's the so closely related and it's the the the the worst part of this for me other than obviously seeing you get upset by it is that we can't have those conversations so I love the shit you don't want to talk about that you've I'd never come across until you told me about it earlier because I love that because these are conversations we need to have and this it's so important to have them because the biggest accessibility barrier I think in the whole world isn't like developers not using semantic HTML and everything else it's ignorance to the fact that they should be I say I keep using the word ignorance but it's like if you don't know it you don't know it and like boot camps don't teach it and things like that and so if you don't know what people are experiencing then you can never have any empathy and you can never do anything about it and the problem is it's all brushed under the carpet and nobody wants to talk about it and I love the fact that you shared that with everybody here even if it was hard and difficult because without people realizing what impact that stuff has they'll make the same mistakes there are probably plenty of people in the world who because someone you know can't read all right all of a sudden they're like you must be stupid and you know what can be further than the truth because more often than not people are dyslexic have a very I don't know whether they're related or whether it's an adjustment or what that's happened but most people who are decided to become very creative I've sinned that and I know you shouldn't make an assumption you know it sounds like the bloody stupid superpower box but it's very very true and it has no impact in your ability to do the things that are important it just means if I'm aware of it I know not to send you a massive long very thick paragraph document I now know to send you things that are broken down sentence by sentence so that it's easier to not have follow run on and you know make sure that I make it very obvious that you can ask me questions if something wasn't clear or I'll send you voice notes if those are preferable by being able to talk about it it means that we can work a solution out the problem is people are so scared to talk about it because then there's a negative connotation and we need to get rid of that to me that's the the biggest thing and thank you it's it's something that I will say I am so grateful for the company I work for at and the team I have right now because like when they found out that I was dyslexic they don't have me do like blog reviews like for Tom Tent Reviews because even though I can use Texas speech it's just going to take me forever and a day longer or something that I think a lot of people in general that we all think a little different and learning how to work with that and talk about it as you said with the how you could be sending somebody like voice messages or when we people now ask me when they're going to be posting something they're like Jen how hard is this for you to read this so that way they have an idea when other people go to read it and I'm like it might sound weird but if you put a lot of emojis like when you're trying to do bullet points I at least know that we're in different areas because then it's a different emoji for each area that's also why I probably emoji way too much and it's it's definitely something that having like it's it's and I'm grateful that that James joined today but it's crazy to think how he knew me back then and how I thought I was like the worst thing in the entire world ever and it's wanting to make sure that other people don't experience this and Renee I love that you found our community like I'm so grateful that you're here and that you show up and that you hang out with us like it's it's definitely something that these are all conversations to be had and Todd I'm going to bring yours up so I can read it developers do not realize the extent and portion of developer community who are disabled and a small part of that is ignorance but it's pure ignorance usually from certain communities that are toxic and I I do like um um the way you say that it's it's a big reason and wow I really did not know that these would overlap so much um that I like shit you don't want to talk about is I created that show was a lot of times it's like we're taught how to think about things and don't always have access or know to exist or how to ask the questions so if you talk to people that are different like how do you ask them about it in a way that's curious and not uh braiding but also how do you have these conversations with people that are okay with taking on the intellectual intellectual and emotional burden like it's not fair to be walking up to um like I have an insane amount of curiosity um and asking people like if they have an amputation I I have comped myself in the past that I'm just purely curious it's not always appropriate to ask y'all it matters on the relationship there's so many things that like it's yes and no and wrong and yes that I like to do what I call bus chuck and ask those questions on the show for us so there's an episode that talks about like generational trauma and what that looks like or being a um a specific race in a different parts of the u
Yeah no well it works for me even if it isn't the right phrase it works for me okay so we should set back then like semantic HTML is the basis the foundation of making things accessible and the reason we call it semantic HTML is within those elements so like for example main element there is extra information that is exposed to assistive technology so that's the semantics it has semantic meaning so if you have divs everywhere on a page when assistive technology tries to pass that page out it has no information about that page structure it has no idea what different elements are for there here's a prime example so on the left we have our typical div soup which you'll find in a lot of tutorials and all sorts of things on the net and then all right we have semantic HTML and so the difference is when I approach that and yet again the screen reader is the easiest way to explain this for someone to visualize on the left it will just say div span div div div div div div at the end of that do you have any idea what that page is about or what any of the sections is no there's no information there on the right hand side as I go around I have landmarks that I can A understand what that's for so it'll say header I know what to expect in a header I'm likely to see a logo I may see some navigational items brilliant I know what that element is and then I get to a nav amazing there's going to be some links in there maybe a couple of buttons depending on the weird design of the website hopefully mainly links aside okay this is supplementary information so this extra information is vital if you don't have visual information on the screen I can't visually see this layout so I have to be able to conjure it up in my head and so that's what semantic HTML is therefore it's to let me know how to get round a page and the added bonuses once I've got familiar with that page so say this was an application you'd built I can use those landmarks with assistive technology to jump around the page the same as you would like just move your mouse from one side to the other you can't do that if you're using the keyboard so the semantic HTML let's me go right I want to jump to the article I can bring up a list of all article elements on the page and I can jump to one of them so it aids with navigation it aids with familiarizing myself with a page ask me sorry go on yeah it's two parts thank you for explaining because that was really helpful and also thank you for comparing the two visuals because that really helped like put words to the visuals and how alt text may show up what's popping out to me right now is you have like understanding does like header one header two like all of those go into semantic HTML that's like part one but also the other part of it was there was a live screen I had a very random moment where I had like 12 people on my live stream at once I was coding well they were all hanging out and just came on to the stream and I remember her talking about something about like design defaults like mobile like if you click a button it's supposed to react to specific way because the design tools say everybody needs to be doing very similar things that's probably something like designing an iOS app so there are some from Apple especially from Apple there are some very strong guidelines on how certain UI elements should behave and even be presented to an extent that is very closely linked to accessibility because one thing that's a very hard one for people to get the head down is expected behavior so like if I see a certain element and it looks like it's a date picker then it better behave like a date picker if I click on it and suddenly it brings up some new funky design that you've come up with that's really out there and out the box that is an accessibility issue because I and that's for everybody it's just for some people it can be a lot harder like I see a new type of date picker I have to work out how do I jump ahead of you how do I jump back a year how do I get to the next month it's cognitive load so that's why it's important and that's why more than likely I could be wrong they were talking about iOS because iOS has very strong guidance on how UI elements should behave so that people can use applications more easily I could be wrong though could just be an internal design system you never know um I'm googling it at the same time and thank you Todd for what you posted and this is I do want to say that I'm not trying to call out like StreamYard and just like keep throwing them out under the bus I'm trying to use examples because if I click on this link to like try to go to the link I can't actually get to the link from StreamYard I have to like and and you talked about cognitive load and also what the expected outcome is is something that I think I agree a lot of people don't think about because while I'm listening to you if I want to put this on screen I have to make sure Twitch is open in another window then copy and paste it and I'm just like what okay I'm hopefully un-staying up to date with the conversation and remembering what you're saying enough and this is just a great I'm excited to look into this later on and um and I mean I looked at Alex I looked at your comment very very briefly you might have already left which is totally okay I totally get that uh in and out but I'm like for some reason I thought it said like uh see you uh Todd and Jen and Graham and I'm like are we saying that we are like all going on the stream at the same time if we do that y'all we have to have Ben as well um like we could just the four of us could just have a conversation about this I don't know I'm just totally spitballing here but um it's interesting to see all this this does help and I think it is very interesting I also something I noticed about myself is I get stuck on trying to figure something out and I think it's like UX design guidelines or something probably uh yet again a lot of those guidelines will have or hopefully will have should I say a foundation in accessibility because whenever you're trying to design a UX design system um or any principles like that it's the designers got a reasonable amount of the responsibility to consider things like do we have space for visible labels on inputs is the color contrast okay what will the flow through this particular workflow be like have we thought of that do I have uh I can give you a good example when I work at daily dev we had a notification system that we put in so like when you upvoted something or left to comment a notification will pop down from the top a nice little toast that was timed and there was no way to stop that from going away which is fine for most people but if you're using a keyboard and you want to uh you know using a sister tech and you want to get to it in time and you want to read it properly you can't do that or maybe you're in the middle of something at the moment and you want to take the time to read it later so what I brought that up and one of the things the implemented was a option to make it so that they don't auto dismiss very simple but for some people can be very very important because now that person can take their time to read it and especially this is like the added benefit there's an international audience on daily dev where English is a secondary or tertiary language you know third language so being able to have extra time to read things is reassuring for people instead of them rushing through it and going what did that say was that important I don't know so it's this is why I always say accessibility benefits everybody because by introducing that feature it meant that everybody can switch it so that those don't auto dismiss and that could be useful for any reason you you brought up a great thing um with that at least related to my life that um um uh the company I work for is an international company and uh the majority of the people I work with English is not their first language and if there are a lot of uh north american humans on a call we can all talk very quickly because we go English to English it's very easy to jump into it where it can take somebody that English is their second language a bit to translate and then be able to catch up and this made me realize a to give more pauses and b to also uh talk slower yes I still get excited like when I get excited I talk really fast and I know that I still something I struggle with but my grandmother was like you finally learned how to talk slower I was like but not because you said so it was because the ironic thing is I feel very cold out because whenever I'm talking about accessibility I get into my little zone I forget that we're talking to an international in fact I forgot other people were here for a minute then I was just chatting to you and yes I felt cold out like because I was talking very quickly so I'm going to now have to go back into my conscious effort like I do in Twitter spaces to talk more slowly and with more annunciation so I like that point James uh just brought up another good point and I I find this is interesting also for the tools you choose to use um while this is primarily a conversation of text accessibility from their perspective um uh from the deaf uh HOH transcripts and captions when you see video audio content which also helps ESL people as well and I completely agree I think this is something that hits home for me because it was a the cognitive load to be able to use um like a tool that would make this happen will stop could stop me from actually streaming and putting out this content and to try to learn this tool even though I really want that tool to be there and that's something that I think is just an my own internal struggle of I would love to use OBS and paying and there is a lot of like tools out there that are in my mind a lot harder for me to learn and take time to learn and test it out while trying to keep up with just having my streams out there and those type of things and I think that is something that is a really important conversation because it it's something that i'm glad accessibility gets talked about in general because this is what's going to change tools to be made this way overall instead of me choosing between two tools to one that's overly technical to set up and use to one that is just a couple clicks of buttons it's a so I like this conversation because I can give you a good example of where there was a huge improvement and that was on xTwitter so originally trying to add an alt text there sorry ultra-tribute text sorry Todd was like something you had to consistently think about and actively think about whereas they changed the interface very simply to say hey you forgot the alt attribute you forgot to put some alt text on this image and that little prompt has massively improved the amount of alt text out there now unfortunately most of it is garbage because people haven't been taught how they missed the step of telling people how to write good alt attributes and alt text but it was a step in the right direction and it leasing to what you were saying about why doesn't twitch just have something built in where you can press one button and captions are generated on the fly like we have the technology it's been there for many many years it may not be perfect but it's better than nothing and it helps people who a I may want to listen to your stream with you on mute and I know that won't be listening at that point but be watching but you know what I mean so I can still enjoy your stream while I've got your mute perhaps I mean the library or on a train or something and secondly obviously for people who are deaf or hard of hearing it means that they can enjoy your content as well one trick I normally do and I presume using stream knowledge you can do screen captures of particular parts of screens are you able to do that um maybe now that it has the the web layouts like they um when I started using stream yard and couple things to go into that one of um thank you Todd for adding this link in here for a string closed capture this actually goes a bit into um start using it today so it only does twitch video on demands or obs web socket which is something that can be plays into what we were just talking about and how easy it is to start looking at something and see that it has the issue um even though we're like oh this would be really cool and this also takes a lot of time to go through all of them but also this is another thing that I don't really necessarily realize that a tool changed so I can um I don't know let's let's let's share my own obs or my own stream yard really quick and look and see if uh um it does what you're thinking about um gram share okay we're gonna have in separate moment yeah here we go bit of inception so you can like it used to be hopefully you can deal with this for a moment if you see right uh below here um or like at towards the bottom above the mute stop cam buttons that menu there's our three images or whoever's on the stream and then above that I am gonna make gram go away for a second it has the um like different visuals that you can go to and these layouts this is not always been here this is something that is I don't know what it came out but um like enough that something worked and I didn't go look at it better so I can do a new layout and add items but I think it can only do one media slot at a time yes okay so right so yes we have the limitation one of the tricks that I use with OBS and in fact if I thought ahead I could have had this lined up so I could have showed you but try to do it now live streams gonna be in that matter is I use an online captioning service so like it's just basically speech to text I have it positioned on one of my monitors and then I capture just two lines of the text and I put that at the bottom of my image so that I basically have what I'm saying showing as text on the screen that's something called open captions which basically means they're burnt into the video like they're part of the video itself that's one really neat quick dirty trick to get it to work um that most people can do unfortunately I think you might be limited there that you can't do that one a better way is to have actual captions but yes that can be difficult and hard work to set up Todd did send me a link to a service that he uses that apparently will put true captions on the screen something called closed captions which are ones that I can activate or switch off those are real captions at that point um so those are the better ones but open captions are also decent um I just want to call this out really quick too because as you're saying where it can be on the screen at the same time we can share screens differently and I think that's a great call out and a tool that you're talking about if if it can do it live like I'm using the twitch chat just as an example is you can put if there is something that can do it um it can show up here and you can like pop out a window to have it show up at the same time um yeah so there's uh this I feel like I we ended up going yeah we're the tannels you know hey I said we were gonna do tangents but this this is the beauty it's that the thing is that these things only to really take one time to set up and then once you've got them set up you can use them forever and you can change the experience for somebody accessing your stream um in a very positive way so if there is a simple way that we could do it why not because like you said one of the big barriers and it's not it's not as bad as it sounds to say it is well that's complicated you know now some people who are in accessibility advocacy would say that's no excuse but unfortunately that is how we are as human beings you know something seems insurmountable and difficult then it's not going to get done if there are other options there that are easier things that have this better impact for us so it's on I think it's on the companies to make it easier to do live captioning on streams obviously now that you're aware of captioning hopefully and we can do it in DMs after we can work out a way where you can have those on your stream because that would be an amazing addition um that would really level it up and I think not just for people who are hard of hearing in deaf I think everybody would benefit for like me when I'm talking quickly and English is a secondary language they can see what I'm saying on the screen and it helps those people as well understand what's being said I agree with that I I have a follow up question and this is something that comes to using a text to speech a lot I use it quite often with my dyslexia I can really mad at things that don't use that very well um also with setting up new tools and this is something that I think I would love to hear people's ideas for of the cognitive load to try to set something like this up like I've spent gobs amount of hours doing it and like had ask different people for help which is amazing a lot of it is where how to work through and this might be really simple but um how to work through when it's even if you're following the directions it's not working the way it's supposed to I know that sounds very weird but like that is something that in my own limitation like we talked about design tools on a phone if a menu is not working properly and I need to get to that spot on a site and I'm like this is not working it is literally an issue with the website I personally get like so it's like one of the few things that get me angry is tech which is weird because I'm in tech um but it like it like I literally get so few mean because I'm like why is this not working the way it's supposed to be working and this is such a big barrier that I get very stuck and can't move past it and it it feels like those are types of things that show up for me that I'm curious if all of you have suggestions on how to work through that because that's not something that I want to have as my own personal barrier but I think others probably get the same way where it's like it how so first of all um if someone makes things difficult for you through their poor decisions then vote with your feet if you are able to it's the first answer there so if it's literally a website and it's crap find another website that offers the same thing now I know that's not always an option but if that's that's option one like walk away from the people who don't give a crap about user experience find someone who does that is essentially what people with disabilities do all the time they go onto a website it's not accessible they'll find a competitor so nice parallel there second one is if you're getting to a point where you're if I've understood you correctly like your stuck because you can't find the information you're looking for more than anything it's like you know you should be able to get to it but you can't find it the easiest way is to try and find another way to source that information by either asking in public or chat GPT now is actually a very reasonable option to get yeah you know we have to bring it up at least once in every stream find an alternative way to get the information you need to get you passed your barrier because a lot of times your barrier is a tiny little part of a very very large item but that little barrier can be enough to just stop you dead in your tracks for days and days and be very disheartening but honestly the best way is to ask people you know if you get stuck on something and you you know you've put in the work it's not you being lazy like oh I can't find it because you spent 10 seconds like you've tried to find that information ask someone who knows better go hey I've really been stuck on this and that's the only way to get past it the only other thing I say is walk away and come back a day later at the amount of times that fixes me getting stressed out stuck on something and then when I walk away and come back and go oh it's there how did I miss that it's because you're too editing the moment that I find that happens with me I don't know if that answered the question because that wasn't quite good to some points I think it is just like our own individual like we all need to work through that ourselves and something of also remembering to go back to it and that's a big reason that I I really like the way that you mentioned when we talked about this earlier of accessibility is your overall focus so even if you go on different tangents or rabbit holes or like squirrel it is something that you go back to that is your focus and those are overall tools and things that I pay a lot of attention to because to me accessibility goes into also a lot of neurodivergencies that is that I personally struggle with and like being dyslexic for so long and not knowing I was dyslexic I had so many teachers and people tell me that I was stupid when I just don't explain it the same way or couldn't put it together or my word structure is how to say this I forget a lot of words like I will try to I have to explain around the word and even when I try to have a conversation with someone and I'm looking at them this is going to make me tear up but hey it's a good conversation to have it's it's where people don't always realize that I'm having these difficulties and don't make jokes of them but I work this hard on it because other people don't have that access or support and I don't want anybody else to to feel dumb or not like that they can have access and I think it's so important for these conversations because like I couldn't imagine not meaning all of these people but there's so many people that we can't then don't have access and this is just talking around I really super-cry that's awesome um first I think this is my first teach ed and text cry yay that means that means it's a good stream but it's it is so this is the point this is the people don't realize how constant little things add up over time and how you know like like you said like people think in your stupid just because you have dyslexis so reading becomes more difficult writing becomes more difficult doesn't mean you stupid at all it just means that's a particular area or be quite a small area in some ways a large area that you find difficult but there there's so many things that in the world that we don't see you know like like you said nobody's probably aware of the struggles that you go through because you do a very good job of masking that particular thing and we shouldn't have to mask stuff that's the whole thing but unfortunately we're not quite as involved as a scientist we think we're still quite cave managed cave woman-ish in our thinking in a lot of ways and so we have a lot of situations where people get upset because you know people have made dumbness dumbness assumptions and I keep using the word dumb and I shouldn't use the word dumb because that's got a negative connotation but bad assumptions about people based on their own ignorance towards things and I don't mean ignorance in the the malicious intent I mean it's you don't know this stuff so you inadvertently say things that you don't understand the impact they're having like the teacher's story is not the first time I've heard that it's quite horrendous that you started that sentence I already knew where it was going and I was already getting annoyed and upset for you because that's a common thing it's like oh you still go to read and write you must be dumb no it's no it's something that and thank you everyone for your support I appreciate it it's also something that shows up at work and one of the biggest reasons I left a company that Renee and I both worked at it's it's something that shows up so deeply and a big reason that I have my other show shit you don't want to talk about because these these are so important and so integrated together that I I now have to update Roy so Roy Enger is somebody that y'all should just know about in this dope human is helping me rebuild my website for the I think fourth time and I've been doing it on the background and he's been helping me like figure out tags and like categories and things like that and he's like do you think teach young tech and shit you don't want to talk about will ever overlap like no no no no but they do in this instance that's why they're it's the so closely related and it's the the the the worst part of this for me other than obviously seeing you get upset by it is that we can't have those conversations so I love the shit you don't want to talk about that you've I'd never come across until you told me about it earlier because I love that because these are conversations we need to have and this it's so important to have them because the biggest accessibility barrier I think in the whole world isn't like developers not using semantic HTML and everything else it's ignorance to the fact that they should be I say I keep using the word ignorance but it's like if you don't know it you don't know it and like boot camps don't teach it and things like that and so if you don't know what people are experiencing then you can never have any empathy and you can never do anything about it and the problem is it's all brushed under the carpet and nobody wants to talk about it and I love the fact that you shared that with everybody here even if it was hard and difficult because without people realizing what impact that stuff has they'll make the same mistakes there are probably plenty of people in the world who because someone you know can't read all right all of a sudden they're like you must be stupid and you know what can be further than the truth because more often than not people are dyslexic have a very I don't know whether they're related or whether it's an adjustment or what that's happened but most people who are decided to become very creative I've sinned that and I know you shouldn't make an assumption you know it sounds like the bloody stupid superpower box but it's very very true and it has no impact in your ability to do the things that are important it just means if I'm aware of it I know not to send you a massive long very thick paragraph document I now know to send you things that are broken down sentence by sentence so that it's easier to not have follow run on and you know make sure that I make it very obvious that you can ask me questions if something wasn't clear or I'll send you voice notes if those are preferable by being able to talk about it it means that we can work a solution out the problem is people are so scared to talk about it because then there's a negative connotation and we need to get rid of that to me that's the the biggest thing and thank you it's it's something that I will say I am so grateful for the company I work for at and the team I have right now because like when they found out that I was dyslexic they don't have me do like blog reviews like for Tom Tent Reviews because even though I can use Texas speech it's just going to take me forever and a day longer or something that I think a lot of people in general that we all think a little different and learning how to work with that and talk about it as you said with the how you could be sending somebody like voice messages or when we people now ask me when they're going to be posting something they're like Jen how hard is this for you to read this so that way they have an idea when other people go to read it and I'm like it might sound weird but if you put a lot of emojis like when you're trying to do bullet points I at least know that we're in different areas because then it's a different emoji for each area that's also why I probably emoji way too much and it's it's definitely something that having like it's it's and I'm grateful that that James joined today but it's crazy to think how he knew me back then and how I thought I was like the worst thing in the entire world ever and it's wanting to make sure that other people don't experience this and Renee I love that you found our community like I'm so grateful that you're here and that you show up and that you hang out with us like it's it's definitely something that these are all conversations to be had and Todd I'm going to bring yours up so I can read it developers do not realize the extent and portion of developer community who are disabled and a small part of that is ignorance but it's pure ignorance usually from certain communities that are toxic and I I do like um um the way you say that it's it's a big reason and wow I really did not know that these would overlap so much um that I like shit you don't want to talk about is I created that show was a lot of times it's like we're taught how to think about things and don't always have access or know to exist or how to ask the questions so if you talk to people that are different like how do you ask them about it in a way that's curious and not uh braiding but also how do you have these conversations with people that are okay with taking on the intellectual intellectual and emotional burden like it's not fair to be walking up to um like I have an insane amount of curiosity um and asking people like if they have an amputation I I have comped myself in the past that I'm just purely curious it's not always appropriate to ask y'all it matters on the relationship there's so many things that like it's yes and no and wrong and yes that I like to do what I call bus chuck and ask those questions on the show for us so there's an episode that talks about like generational trauma and what that looks like or being a um a specific race in a different parts of the us and different identities and all of that goes into accessibility too so when we're talking about ignorance it's also generational and it's so much harder to break apart and yeah I had no idea that these we tied together that much thanks Graham no problem no problem just so you have a minute to sort of you know recenter and everything because like so I could tell that was a difficult thing to say out loud um there's something that you said in there which is the hardest thing around accessibility is how do you ask and where is the onus on you for self education versus the onus on some one who I'm gonna say has a different experience in life because maybe they're an amputee where's the onus on them to explain how best to interact for example do I put my hand out to shake your hand if you've had your right arm amputated is that bad manners or would you consider it bad manners if I didn't put my hand out and this is the really difficult conversation that you can't have and it's the problem is we're getting worse at it not better because social media has made us all very scared of saying you know for example I kept using the word done before and I always tried itself correct because I know the negative connotation but that fear for a lot of people will stop them having the conversation in the first place because they're like what if I say the wrong word that's the crux of half the problem though because if you don't know the impact of what you're doing then you're never going to do anything about it so we need to get rid of some of that fear so I love the podcasts that you're doing like I said I've never caught it but I'm certainly going to what uh listen to it now because they are important conversations and they need to be had in a frank way so that you can ask the the stupid questions you can ask the question that you know you don't know the answer to oh this is the one here I tell you this one this was the one that I I got right but I really was not comfortable at the point that I got it right and I don't know if it's right as a general rule I met someone who had a hook for a hand at a networking event and so I literally put my hand out and shook their hook but in my head in that moment it seemed like an eternity of me asking now is it appropriate for me to grab that hook is that hook an extension of them or is it an assistive aid that they prefer I don't touch is it going to be weird when I grab the hook is it dangerous for me to grab that hook it looks quite sharp maybe it's going to pinch my all that was running through my head whereas literally if someone has said to me hey this is my hook feel free to grab it don't worry it's it's like my hand I've gone boom frat I'm okay I'm comfortable because we don't want to upset anyone we're then worried and I'd say my rule of thumb now has been I asked the dumb question and if I offend someone I'll apologise rather than making an assumption because the assumption is more dangerous position to be in and so I agree with that and that's been my attitude I also like the way that you mentioned that they could have mentioned it but it's not necessarily on them either like it is no and and yes to that point you made though like is it something that somebody needs to address themselves and share the information or something that we need to learn to ask and that is so much so so deep in this conversation and it I'm gonna go I'm gonna like wrap this all all the way back of I'll say one last thing one last thing y'all um it's gonna be great um maybe I will I don't know why at the stage there we go look it has a link tree and um I haven't Wesley Faulkner was one of the last people I had on the show um talking about intersectionality he's big in the tech field that's why I mentioned him um but I haven't had an episode since almost a year ago so that's why nobody really knows about it and I'm currently looking for you know if anybody wants to talk about this shit and wants to be on the show please let me know because other than today with Graham no really I don't talk about this stuff on live streams um they're pre-recorded because you know people aren't always comfortable talking about it that way okay now that that's out of the way because I told Graham I was gonna bring it up and you know I found an awkward way of doing it and not awkward at all honestly it's one it's one of the I'm gonna use a word nicest it's not the word I want to use but I can't think it's one of the nicest thing to see someone just finally say the shit that they want to say you know it's the thing that's been hiding under the surface and no one wants to talk about it for fear of someone I don't know jujing and just you sharing that today was it is one of the things that I I enjoy seeing that and I know don't mean that you know I enjoy seeing your upset I enjoy you sharing that with people so that people can see because this is the thing that this is why I like accessibility it's the the impact you can have without even thinking about it like you said the voice note thing is the simplest thing in the world but without knowing to ask that it's very difficult to get that in place for somebody which is why I try and approach it the other way which is I will ask someone if they're okay with voice notes because on the flip side someone may not be okay with voice notes at all you don't know if they're hard of hearing or if they find that hard comprehend so asking the question the problem is we've I've not got got to asking the other way which is would you prefer to have a voice note so after today I'm going to try and make that a thing that as I'm DMing people I'll say would you prefer a voice note it's a very small change that potentially could have a big impact and I think if we had more of that sorry I've gone off on a tangent and I'm going to go on the tangent so I'm going to back up a little bit I think in the workplace we need to be able to without any fear of reprisal or ejection be able to say hey I have this disability and this is what I need in order to do my job I think that would be the biggest accessibility win we could have in the world because now that I know that you're dyslexic immediately I go right well what do you need and that's the only question I need to ask and you tell me how best it gives you information like if we can get to that that would be amazing the problem is there's still the stigma there's still the ignorance in society that we can't deal with but that's my aim is to make more employers aware that if you ask the question you'll find the people who are going to work hard for you because you've said it yourself you love the company you're at now and a very brutal truth behind this that yet again shit we don't want to talk about here's one that will get me cancelled by saying this but it's you will be a more loyal employee to that company than most people who don't have a disability because you've found somewhere where people have taken the consideration and the time and you've been in the position where you don't you've had the shit experience and that's a horrible thing to say out loud is one of those unspoken truths but hell retaining staff is one of the biggest companies at problems companies have and if by just making minor adjustments to the workflow I retain you for a year longer than somebody else fucking win win for me as a company you know and I know that's a horrible truth but we could go on and hold another tangent that way I'm sorry I'm trying to get your way for the upset but I'm sorry I'm trying to know yeah and I'm good and I appreciate that and it's also something that just to mention of if people feel comfortable talking about certain aspects of their personality or their learning or things like that it does make it easier for people to communicate with them yet not everyone is at that place or safe enough to have those conversations like physically and emotionally safe enough and I do want to call that out because I can't I do have the the privilege to say yo I'm super ADHD dyslexic I also am bipolar type 2 have the dash of anxiety depression and a shit ton of PTSD it's super fun like a podcast if you want to find out more but being able to say that to people and tell them yo I will probably forget to reply to you it might be a year before I reply to you again I don't mean to we'll be friends for life and also if I do reply to you and you may get 20 messages like a stage 5 clinger in between him because it's actually me remembering to tell you things so I'm like like one or one or the other and never know and being able to talk about that out loud has lets people have those expectations so they know ahead of time but it's taken me a lot to get here and that's why I want to bring it up I also want to bring up the fact that I don't know if cat is still here but jasmine is catnip and I am Sam or I don't know what their handle is off the top of my head is cat they I think just joined the my our discord group and they have the backwards names so it's going to be very interesting of keeping track of that um but to bring it all the way back what are your top five when building a website for accessibility that you take into consideration top five so top five things first things first keyboard navigation so it's so hard to just randomly go back and do that you know yeah so keyboard navigation I will always be conscious of how will I navigate this out with the keyboard is this something that's interactive if so can I focus on it uh centered with that there's also focus indicators that's one of the big ones have I remembered to style my focus indicators because default ones are pretty enough um so I always make sure there's decent contrast on them second one am I using semantic HTML that we were talking about earlier um am I using something that is descriptive of what this element does on a page so like said please everybody if you ever find yourself writing a href equals hash or a href equals java script void you probably need a button that's that's my big pet peeve please just use buttons when you need to use buttons that's what they're there for um third thing I'll be thinking about and it starts early on in the thought is if I'm designing a component for a page I will be thinking early on about like I said the keyboard accessibility but also how is the information structured in a logical way is there a sufficient size tap target for people who are using either a mobile device or maybe have uh dexterity issues so they can't be accurate so our tap target is large enough and things like that so those things together all I think cover five I don't know how many I've done there right guys you put well you said keyboard nav and focus indicators would that be one or two different we'll call that one because without the focus indicators it's impossible to navigate by keyboard so we'll call that one let's make this happen uh two is semantic html yeah that's definitely one and then uh three is uh is the component that is being built have a large enough touch area yeah tap target is the word I use for it it's it's it's basically you've got to think of it like this which is if someone has something like cerebral palsy which is a private sample or Parkinson's disease their ability to tap a very specific point on a phone is is it's very very difficult it requires a lot of concentration tensing the muscles up and even then they are likely to miss so having large tap targets which is basically the clickable area is a huge win for accessibility for everybody else it just means that you don't accidentally click the wrong link it's a win win but you know it's it's less frustrating so that's a big one that I always think about is how can I make this item this area larger to click on that that's a huge accessibility win uh fourth one I'll be thinking about then is probably I'm just trying to think how I would go through the process because it's so automatic and I don't don't manually think about it I think the fourth thing that I'll be thinking about when designing a page is consistency because it's never a single page application there's not even and I don't mean single page like Sparta I mean there's never one page of content really the several pages so have I got consistent designs throughout the site so are all the buttons similar or at least have similar styling so I can identify a button easily on the page is the navigation consistent across the website or does it suddenly change on different pages because that's terrible experience for some people so I'll be thinking about consistency a lot you know if I display images ideally I want to be displaying them in a similar way all the way through the site so that they don't start going to random layouts which can be very confusing and off-putting and then the final one I think about is language there you go I've thought of a good fifth one that isn't an obvious one reading age of a 12 year old this is one of the rules that doesn't get spoken a lot when people are talking about accessibility but I will run my reading through and I'll share this in the chat through Hemingway the Hemingway app and what this app does is it analyzes your writing it gives you a rough idea of the reading age of whatever you've written and it's a fantastic way when I finally get back to Twitch it's a fantastic way of making your language simpler and easier to understand and this is the one that shocked me the most when I got started getting into accessibility which is in the UK at least one in five adults in the UK have a reading age of a 12 year old that is expected of a 12 year old when you consider that you realize how many people you can exclude by using complicated language and then it's a really good one to be able to translate over to a business because you can go well one in five people are going to struggle to understand your message if you use all that jargon-concluded language and everything else keep your language simple and to the point stop trying to sound smart then you maximize the amount of people you can reach so I love that as a fifth point and I don't talk about that one often enough I hope that I hope that fulfills the build out yet have I got five or do you need more
s and different identities and all of that goes into accessibility too so when we're talking about ignorance it's also generational and it's so much harder to break apart and yeah I had no idea that these we tied together that much thanks Graham no problem no problem just so you have a minute to sort of you know recenter and everything because like so I could tell that was a difficult thing to say out loud um there's something that you said in there which is the hardest thing around accessibility is how do you ask and where is the onus on you for self education versus the onus on some one who I'm gonna say has a different experience in life because maybe they're an amputee where's the onus on them to explain how best to interact for example do I put my hand out to shake your hand if you've had your right arm amputated is that bad manners or would you consider it bad manners if I didn't put my hand out and this is the really difficult conversation that you can't have and it's the problem is we're getting worse at it not better because social media has made us all very scared of saying you know for example I kept using the word done before and I always tried itself correct because I know the negative connotation but that fear for a lot of people will stop them having the conversation in the first place because they're like what if I say the wrong word that's the crux of half the problem though because if you don't know the impact of what you're doing then you're never going to do anything about it so we need to get rid of some of that fear so I love the podcasts that

prefer I don't touch is it going to be weird when I grab the hook is it dangerous for me to grab that hook it looks quite sharp maybe it's going to pinch my all that was running through my head whereas literally if someone has said to me hey this is my hook feel free to grab it don't worry it's it's like my hand I've gone boom frat I'm okay I'm comfortable because we don't want to upset

do you need more No I mean we could always have more but I think five this is a great way for someone to start and I think in my opinion the color contrast those type of things would go into the consistency of design as well but to read the top five we have a keyboard navigation and focus indicators top number two is semantic HTML three is the component that is being is the component that is being built have a large enough tap target for consistency and design and five simple language I'm reasonably happy with that because that covers a lot of things you know that's that there's a broad things to think about where you can then go and focus on detail afterwards the one thing I would say if anyone here is brand new to accessibility the first item I mentioned is the easiest one to test yourself on your own website without any accessibility knowledge you can literally just press the tab key and see if a you can get to everything and b can you see where the focus is on the page the amount of websites that fail that and where apps that fail that is astounding so that's one to go and try yourself if if at any point you get lost on a page or something that should be focusable doesn't get focused when you're tapping around the page you've got an accessibility problem you may not know how to fix it yet but at least you know there's an issue and you can start exploring so that's why I love the tab test it's it's such a good easy way for people to go oh crap there's something wrong I don't know what yet thank you thank you and hello Aaron I think Alex brought up a great question of I don't even know how to say it numerous numerous yeah so new merinimp so it's a brilliant thing so you know how I don't know if you ever seen but accessibility is often displayed as a double one why yes which Ben told me why and I got really excited because there's 11 letters exactly there's 11 letters in the middle that's a new merinimp right the problem with it is it's not very accessible is it so it's like the the irony of in accessibility we use a double one why all the time is hilarious to me because you don't know what that word means until someone explains it to you it's like you see it everywhere in tech you know I 1 8 10 for internationalization right it's straight up um I um jasmine I was about to put yours up and I was like what is that and then Todd put both of them up there and I'm like I love it I'd even look to the chapter you literally picked up all the ones I was thinking of right then you were what's what's T
No I mean we could always have more but I think five this is a great way for someone to start and I think in my opinion the color contrast those type of things would go into the consistency of design as well but to read the top five we have a keyboard navigation and focus indicators top number two is semantic HTML three is the component that is being is the component that is being built have a large enough tap target for consistency and design and five simple language I'm reasonably happy with that because that covers a lot of things you know that's that there's a broad things to think about where you can then go and focus on detail afterwards the one thing I would say if anyone here is brand new to accessibility the first item I mentioned is the easiest one to test yourself on your own website without any accessibility knowledge you can literally just press the tab key and see if a you can get to everything and b can you see where the focus is on the page the amount of websites that fail that and where apps that fail that is astounding so that's one to go and try yourself if if at any point you get lost on a page or something that should be focusable doesn't get focused when you're tapping around the page you've got an accessibility problem you may not know how to fix it yet but at least you know there's an issue and you can start exploring so that's why I love the tab test it's it's such a good easy way for people to go oh crap there's something wrong I don't know what yet thank you thank you and hello Aaron I think Alex brought up a great question of I don't even know how to say it numerous numerous yeah so new merinimp so it's a brilliant thing so you know how I don't know if you ever seen but accessibility is often displayed as a double one why yes which Ben told me why and I got really excited because there's 11 letters exactly there's 11 letters in the middle that's a new merinimp right the problem with it is it's not very accessible is it so it's like the the irony of in accessibility we use a double one why all the time is hilarious to me because you don't know what that word means until someone explains it to you it's like you see it everywhere in tech you know I 1 8 10 for internationalization right it's straight up um I um jasmine I was about to put yours up and I was like what is that and then Todd put both of them up there and I'm like I love it I'd even look to the chapter you literally picked up all the ones I was thinking of right then you were what's what's TI.L do you know what any of these you see you see that's the that's the funny thing so the other thing that Todd said was abbreviations T.I.L is today I learned but until you know that then you don't learn what T.I.L
I.L do you know what any of these you see you see that's the that's the funny thing so the other thing that Todd said was abbreviations T.I.L is today I learned but until you know that then you don't learn what T.I.L these it's like the funny thing yeah um I and I realized that even if I like can pick up context if somebody is saying it a lot of times I don't remember them like uh goch great it's a whole time yeah and I was like yo my friend was like Christina's a goat goat Christina's a goat yeah that's the thing you can get from the you can get from the context that it's a positive thing but you don't know what exactly it is yeah I get I get that one there's a very good point there in the abbreviations thing which is because we're in tech so we are the abbreviations capital of the world in tech like everything's an abbreviation and so here's a really good tip for people who may write which is first time you use an abbreviation put the full explanation of it in brackets just the first time you use it in each article each page it's a great way to make things more accessible because then I go onto a page I might be new to tech or maybe I'm new to the subject area and all of a sudden you're like okay HTML what the hell's an HTML if you say hypertext markup language next to it and then I have maybe even a link to go and read about it I can understand what that abbreviation is for so there's a really good exactly like that okay just to make sure that we had a reference I wanted to make sure I if I got it right yeah only the first time then for the rest of that conversation you can use lll yeah I love this it's just turned into an abbreviations game now I don't is this what yaml actually means y'all I believe sir I believe that's the actual if not then I've been filled this whole time because that's what I thought it's stuff for as well so I've either bought into a meme or that's the actual name of it and Todd put thank you web accessibility guidelines yes this is something that if y'all and this is something that I'm gonna I'm repeating myself because I got excited of this is why we have teached young tech yes I love learning and it's super fun but is to ask these questions like I've literally asked someone on a stream what is a dip pack because I didn't know yeah well this is it yeah this is oh my favorite one there is pebcat that's one that's brilliant that one so here in this book so that's that's for a way to describe people who are basically they say something's wrong with an application but actually it's them that's wrong it's problem exists between computer and keyboard that's what it stands for so it's like the problem is not the actual thing it's the person using it is the problem oh and I like I like that sometimes it's just helpful to know the history of it so a one one why as ally came also came out of earlier Twitter they believed so it was to minimize the number of characters consumed from the 140 character limit it was never meant to really be all income to seeing abbreviation and wait what there's more there's what is this I'm not I'm not I'm not clicking them anymore like if you're gonna put them like it do tell me what they mean afterwards oh yeah RTFM was the one that I thought it was um that's that's read the FM manual so yes I like that one yeah but yeah this is the whole point so the thing is that like if you put the full expanded version in brackets afterwards at least it within the context of that document even if you've called it tomorrow you'd understand what it meant for the rest of that article or document probably or at least you could reference back to it so that's why I always say abbreviations are a nightmare expand them fully the first time you use them in any article or document or anything you create it and you make things so much more accessible pretty much for free and also uh since y'all are the community they're shows up often also please put them in the chat when you're using something uh if it's not said on screen so that way we know what they're talking about wait wait was wassy week is spelled wassy is pronounced wassy week I never knew that I always say wizzy week I say wizzy wig oh you see I'm learning so much this has been such an educational stream Jen I say wizzy wig yeah like what bedro it uh here's the one that was you was you wig I've never and do you really I don't know if that's ever come up on one of our conversations I love this the the one that I want everyone to take on board as the correct pronunciation now is you know sql I'm afraid it has to be said as squirrel I saw that once and now I'm like you know what that's that's it that's what it is my squirrel you say so disappointed Jen I want to know squirrel oh um Aaron I can just like can I can I make you a mod or something hold on how how do I do this y'all I don't know oh there we go oh you can fast mod people now oh well that's fun oh well a lot of it has to do with agodadi um they used my sequel with php my admin for um wordpress things and I heard it as my sequel it is how I it's yeah stubbornly about that one and that is also something that I uh if it doesn't hurt anybody that I'm learning to just let it go if other people do it differently this is one of them because I'm like no it's my sequel oh if we're going to start a war over this then but we have to we have to ask how do you pronounce this next one g-i-f how do you pronounce that one as in the image format for animate yeah that's the right answer as far as I'm concerned but we will start a war now because people will say it's jiff I agree with that I also just one um one thing that frustrated me at the very beginning was beat because it's French and so it said as beat v-e-e-t not white which is how it's spelled and learning the history um is something that helps understand brilliant idea for a video brilliant idea for a video is this is the correct pronunciation of all the things and then you just go through all of the tech terms is it versel or versal you know like someone needs to you know we we need to decide these things can we have alien do it because I can't get their name right okay I don't I must admit this um one of my very very very very very very very dear friends I've been friends with her for like eight years okay that is how she spells her name and I couldn't stop saying i miss no matter how she said it no matter how many times she said it and then all of a sudden in march or april this year like we've been friends for this long I finally got that it's uh enus yep yeah I can see that one
these it's like the funny thing yeah um I and I realized that even if I like can pick up context if somebody is saying it a lot of times I don't remember them like uh goch great it's a whole time yeah and I was like yo my friend was like Christina's a goat goat Christina's a goat yeah that's the thing you can get from the you can get from the context that it's a positive thing but you don't know what exactly it is yeah I get I get that one there's a very good point there in the abbreviations thing which is because we're in tech so we are the abbreviations capital of the world in tech like everything's an abbreviation and so here's a really good tip for people who may write which is first time you use an abbreviation put the full explanation of it in brackets just the first time you use it in each article each page it's a great way to make things more accessible because then I go onto a page I might be new to tech or maybe I'm new to the subject area and all of a sudden you're like okay HTML what the hell's an HTML if you say hypertext markup language next to it and then I have maybe even a link to go and read about it I can understand what that abbreviation is for so there's a really good exactly like that okay just to make sure that we had a reference I wanted to make sure I if I got it right yeah only the first time then for the rest of that conversation you can use lll yeah I love this it's just turned into an abbreviations game now I don't is this what yaml actually means y'all I believe sir I believe that's the actual if not then I've been filled this whole time because that's what I thought it's stuff for as well so I've either bought into a meme or that's the actual name of it and Todd put thank you web accessibility guidelines yes this is something that if

couldn't click it just couldn't click and I'm like I would try but it wouldn't click so you know you got to do what you got to do I can feel I can feel you on that one I'm trying to say we've got set far off dungeon double weight is brilliant we have we got the fly we did get the fight before we went through all this and thanks to you brought it up so therefore we had to like figure out what all of these meant it was a very wonderful tangent and I think a great way to you know sign off this dream on because it's on such a happy moment um is there anything that you wanted to cover today specifically other than us getting to the top five suggestions um um when building a website no there's there's there's only really one thing which is look some people will shout you down when you're trying to do things accessible especially if you say hey I've made this more accessible there's a very small percentage of people who are going to say yeah but you forgot this and everything don't be put off by those people most of the community who care about accessibility will support you so just try and do one thing like I said go do the tap test on your own website if you're new to accessibility and you're watching the stream I don't know if anybody is or if everybody hears accessibility focus but if you knew go do the tap test that I said just try and tap round your website and if you find a problem then go and ask the question how do I fix this I know I have a problem but I don't know how to fix it my DMs are open for anything that isn't Googleable so basically if you if you are trying to do something with accessibility you've googled it you still can't find an answer my DMs are open I will always try and help and I always say that very important fact though if it's something that you can google you may get a snarky comment back with here's the link to Google for the question you asked you know so not often I'm just a bit spicy that way I say still ask because specifically there are a lot of things that are Googleable but if you ask anybody that knows me well I am the worst at googling anything possible like I don't know like I cannot google the things I literally will walk up to people and be like this is what I'm trying to look for how do I google it is something that I ask people often so in that case special special exception for you Jen because we know each other no just you can you can say that though I'm horrible like a big part of it y'all is if you're asking for help tell people what you've looked for tell people the work you've done because even though I may be horrible at googling things if people understand that they're like oh well that's cool well try this instead and it's very important differential because yes as Graham said a lot of people will try to reach out and they have to say anything and it is like y'all I'm not going to do your homework for you so told us kindly said that anyone can do you have any anything will be a prima donna like me look I get so many DMs now on twitter I just can't handle it when people say hi so that's where it comes from it's not meant to be hostile everybody I want to be clear it's just I get so many random hello's that I just I've grown tired I've grown tired of it anyone on this stream is welcome to DM me whenever they want how's that are we happy now is that less hostile no I like this I like the spicy take I did like the spicy take and I I also I find it really funny I feel like I shouldn't say this but I feel like somehow either twitter really protects me from it or people just don't reach out to me on twitter that much like people just I don't have the random DMs even when jasmine and I started talking I like we DMs like a while ago for my thing a twitter space like I don't I don't know I think I need everybody through twitter or streams or stuff but as some of you are in this but if you're not you can join our discord group Kizworkl and my dnd friends have been pushing me to actually talk about our community and have a place where people can go because they're like hey we have the open spin source raid group discord so you should have people join it and talk to you about your shows and I was like oh I should probably do that so now I'm actually doing that and some of you are in it already which is awesome so yes so Todd we're not doing dnd at the moment right now we're we stopped our last campaign at least that I was playing that I was a part of in I don't know way earlier this year so oh yes Alex Todd you can do a one shot on the expanse it would be really cool we need to tell you about Roy Roy is the game master and the one helping me build my site and these are also a big like a big reason I really like this community is I go hey I'm trying to do something is this even possible or what do I google and it's a great community to do that because they're all waste-murder than I am when it comes to all this tech stuff I've been learning and they're very wonderful at teaching and frustrating me to learn myself but helpful that's what you need and also look I've put it off on a tangent here as always seems to be my superpower but ask the questions even if you think they're dumb like we said that earlier but find the place where you feel comfortable to ask those questions that you're like I should know the answer to that I've had to lately ask a lot of questions that you would think someone who's been a software developer 15 years would know which are things like hey how do I get react apt to work like the fact I'm asking that question to most people would be shocking but I never play with it so go and ask dumb questions better to ask the questions and learn than to sit in ignorance all the time so I'm sorry I said about the DM thing just DM me ignore me it's fine but go find the place where you can ask the questions and I agree with everything you were saying there Jen like you have to be able to go and ask the questions and get the answers in a way that works for you I think that's a better answer than I give originally we have and we're happier with that one I think I will okay now you're gonna I'm gonna go on a tangent now you have to protect your bubble you have to protect your bubble like if you don't protect your energy and your bubble and things going on people will just take take take take take and the way you phrase things I liked that it's a way of of doing that and also like you're gonna have people like me that are like but what about this which is really annoying like I annoy myself about this stuff I just want to let you know like it is it is awfully annoying but it's something that it's all a balance and finding your own guidance and a big reason that I think Graham's hilarious and super fun is learning to just be who you are no matter who that is and your people you'll find your people yeah I always go by a rule of a third of people in the world will like you a third of the people tolerate you in a third of the people won't like you and you know what there's seven and a bit billion people so two and a bit billions enough to go up for me I'm happy enough with that you know I like it I like it all right y'all I'm going to see if anybody's online oh Chris is online to raid two so we'll raid to him amazing and we will see all of you later and I will be back next week actually Roy and Jacob are going to be on here next week about clerk we're going to learn about authentication yeah yeah and I have so many questions for them it's going to be exciting so see you sometime on Tuesday because I'm not great at being consistent on time frames just on Tuesday that's what we're going to stick with Tuesday-ish um and bye uh see you everybody thanks for having me Jen yeah bye
It just couldn't click it just couldn't click and I'm like I would try but it wouldn't click so you know you got to do what you got to do I can feel I can feel you on that one I'm trying to say we've
