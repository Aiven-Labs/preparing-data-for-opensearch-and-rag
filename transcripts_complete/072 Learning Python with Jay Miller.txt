Hello, hello, beautiful humans. Welcome back to another teach Shantek. And instead of learning with Laura Python, we have a new guest. I'm new. I've been here before. Yeah, but you haven't been here for Python. Which is weird because Python is what I do It's funny because I've done two VS code things. And both times I've had to preface with like I just like VS code. I use it. Yes, I get paid to talk about it from time to time. But like ultimately Python is the space that I'm in
It's funny because I've done two VS code things. And both times I've had to preface with like I just like VS code. I use it. Yes, I get paid to talk about it from time to time. But like ultimately Python is the space that I'm in Yeah, and it's so funny because like there's a specific people that I think about for Python and you are one of them. And yet at the same time, you've never been on the show for Python until today. I'm happy to fix that
Yeah, and it's so funny because like there's a specific people that I think about for Python and you are one of them. And yet at the same time, you've never been on the show for Python until today. I'm happy to fix that And let's see if I remember all the details about Jay, not all the details, of course, but Jay is a dev role or developer advocate over at Microsoft and on the VS code team. No, I'm on the cloud team. I'm a cloud team
And let's see if I remember all the details about Jay, not all the details, of course, but Jay is a dev role or developer advocate over at Microsoft and on the VS code team. No, I'm on the cloud team. I'm a cloud team I'm a cloud team. Yes, I'm I am a cloud developer advocate or senior cloud advocate, which our focus is mostly Azure, or Azure products with a little bit of sprinkling into some of those other spaces. So I'm going to do a VS code
I'm a cloud team. Yes, I'm I am a cloud developer advocate or senior cloud advocate, which our focus is mostly Azure, or Azure products with a little bit of sprinkling into some of those other spaces. So I'm going to do a VS code The things that you might use to develop things to go into Azure, but then also we're big proponents of open source. So working to help create open source projects help maintain them when we can. And you know, get more people involved in Python
The things that you might use to develop things to go into Azure, but then also we're big proponents of open source. So working to help create open source projects help maintain them when we can. And you know, get more people involved in Python And what are you doing in the Python world? That's really cool and how you promote it. I do a little bit. Most of my focus is around community. So I wind up. I am one of the organizers for the San Diego Python user group
And what are you doing in the Python world? That's really cool and how you promote it. I do a little bit. Most of my focus is around community. So I wind up. I am one of the organizers for the San Diego Python user group I'm also the host of Python community news or one of the hosts of Python community news. My co host John and I we do a show once a month now. It's monthly because we've been with a lot. Yeah, we just we talk about the the non programming side of Python, the community
I'm also the host of Python community news or one of the hosts of Python community news. My co host John and I we do a show once a month now. It's monthly because we've been with a lot. Yeah, we just we talk about the the non programming side of Python, the community The Python community is one of those really weird things that people tend to not know as much about it's it's like the iceberg kind of principle where
The Python community is one of those really weird things that people tend to not know as much about it's it's like the iceberg kind of principle where You know, you're a Python developer and you see like the tip of the iceberg, which is like the PSF and like Python US and some of these other conferences. But what you don't see is like this gigantic mass underneath that is like
You know, you're a Python developer and you see like the tip of the iceberg, which is like the PSF and like Python US and some of these other conferences. But what you don't see is like this gigantic mass underneath that is like Here are all the other organizations that help make Python run like the Europe Python society and the DSF and deaf none like around the Django space and. All these other communities that exist and initiatives and fundraisers and there there's a lot that happens and since Python tends to be more
Here are all the other organizations that help make Python run like the Europe Python society and the DSF and deaf none like around the Django space and. All these other communities that exist and initiatives and fundraisers and there there's a lot that happens and since Python tends to be more I guess asking of community participation and community support. And it's very, very volunteer ran so where some JavaScript frameworks will have kind of an entire company behind them
I guess asking of community participation and community support. And it's very, very volunteer ran so where some JavaScript frameworks will have kind of an entire company behind them I was just thinking that yeah, you don't you don't get that as much there are some there's like there's anaconda and kind of a lot of the data science stuff and even then that's very loosely based in that some of those projects are like company driven products but
I was just thinking that yeah, you don't you don't get that as much there are some there's like there's anaconda and kind of a lot of the data science stuff and even then that's very loosely based in that some of those projects are like company driven products but And so those are even like you know there is a nonprofit that like numfocus that helps with a lot of the scientific community and a lot of those open source projects so
And so those are even like you know there is a nonprofit that like numfocus that helps with a lot of the scientific community and a lot of those open source projects so It's it's good to have something that talks beyond the code to help kind of understand how all of these things are duct tape together to to make what is a very vast Python ecosystem
It's it's good to have something that talks beyond the code to help kind of understand how all of these things are duct tape together to to make what is a very vast Python ecosystem And I think that is such a good point in like when I first started coding and then I said y'all this is only like seven months ago, which is bananas to me i'm like yes doing this seven months that's also to a year now
And I think that is such a good point in like when I first started coding and then I said y'all this is only like seven months ago, which is bananas to me i'm like yes doing this seven months that's also to a year now I learned JavaScript because it was what was presented to me, I guess is like it was more of like a I asked people like what I wanted to learn like what should I learn and a lot of people said Python if I wanted to go into data science
I learned JavaScript because it was what was presented to me, I guess is like it was more of like a I asked people like what I wanted to learn like what should I learn and a lot of people said Python if I wanted to go into data science People said JavaScript if you want to just be able to do everything we're not even talking about the frameworks in JavaScript just vanilla and. It was always like this thing like I knew about Python that I was like
People said JavaScript if you want to just be able to do everything we're not even talking about the frameworks in JavaScript just vanilla and. It was always like this thing like I knew about Python that I was like But I kind of want to learn Python what up Aaron yay hello hello Aaron what languages do you know. Aaron hi Aaron yay. Aaron is one of the coolest people I've ever met in the tech industry and when it talks about learning community things. Aaron's the person to talk community with
But I kind of want to learn Python what up Aaron yay hello hello Aaron what languages do you know. Aaron hi Aaron yay. Aaron is one of the coolest people I've ever met in the tech industry and when it talks about learning community things. Aaron's the person to talk community with Aaron's amazing and thank you, thank you, I appreciate that I actually never I don't know if Aaron and I have never talked about languages. If you ever catch Aaron out on the streets just just get around a bird scooter and like you'll have you'll have a glass
Aaron's amazing and thank you, thank you, I appreciate that I actually never I don't know if Aaron and I have never talked about languages. If you ever catch Aaron out on the streets just just get around a bird scooter and like you'll have you'll have a glass I am I am glad to see that Python is greater than. JavaScript wait wait what we're going back yay yay we're all the J people you know I just like take the first letter like his name and then I take that first letter and just keep it going. It works it works
I am I am glad to see that Python is greater than. JavaScript wait wait what we're going back yay yay we're all the J people you know I just like take the first letter like his name and then I take that first letter and just keep it going. It works it works It works it works. What I was wanting to say though really quick is a lot of people have this idea that Python is only for data science. And I've learned quite a bit about JavaScript as because people are just like hey this is what we're going to do when I'm like okay this is cool whatever
It works it works. What I was wanting to say though really quick is a lot of people have this idea that Python is only for data science. And I've learned quite a bit about JavaScript as because people are just like hey this is what we're going to do when I'm like okay this is cool whatever And where Python is what I'm learning from the bare basics of coding and so we Lauren I have been going through this book which I will show here
And where Python is what I'm learning from the bare basics of coding and so we Lauren I have been going through this book which I will show here What a automate the boring stuff with Python which is from Al Swagart I believe that's how you say it and we've learned a lot we've learned how I've learned how I learned better and now we're going chapter by chapter going through it and Laura wasn't available this weekend
What a automate the boring stuff with Python which is from Al Swagart I believe that's how you say it and we've learned a lot we've learned how I've learned how I learned better and now we're going chapter by chapter going through it and Laura wasn't available this weekend And Jason he would come on and I'm very excited about this because and knowing now that Aaron can too we could just like learn Python from everyone just have different guests on for Python which is fun and
And Jason he would come on and I'm very excited about this because and knowing now that Aaron can too we could just like learn Python from everyone just have different guests on for Python which is fun and You're funny they let let on the let you want to birds could run supervised you're in coordinated yeah i've heard that about you Aaron
You're funny they let let on the let you want to birds could run supervised you're in coordinated yeah i've heard that about you Aaron You had to get to food it was I get I get that I get that let's figure out how to know how to get people okay it's going to stay there because I don't know how to remove it. I can't do anything on my side
You had to get to food it was I get I get that I get that let's figure out how to know how to get people okay it's going to stay there because I don't know how to remove it. I can't do anything on my side Yeah so please ignore the first time chatter of Liz bought because i'm so learning how to how to block people alright so let me go ahead and present my screen so we can go into the Python e stuff and i'm going to go back up page really quick to
Yeah so please ignore the first time chatter of Liz bought because i'm so learning how to how to block people alright so let me go ahead and present my screen so we can go into the Python e stuff and i'm going to go back up page really quick to And post this here feature that's post yeah I I second one Aaron saying in the chat of like automate the boring stuff is one of those books I think that kind of like what you were saying earlier where like the Python community is so vast that people tend to forget that there are so many
And post this here feature that's post yeah I I second one Aaron saying in the chat of like automate the boring stuff is one of those books I think that kind of like what you were saying earlier where like the Python community is so vast that people tend to forget that there are so many Areas of Python like I my journey into learning Python was somewhat centered around web development but
Areas of Python like I my journey into learning Python was somewhat centered around web development but Commercially it was I was a horrible employee and didn't like sitting at my desk and working so I just started automating all of my job it was like oh updating user accounts in active directory automated oh sitting out scheduled emails when we had
Commercially it was I was a horrible employee and didn't like sitting at my desk and working so I just started automating all of my job it was like oh updating user accounts in active directory automated oh sitting out scheduled emails when we had Little task things I was like automated like my job was I had everything running into a spreadsheet of like different things that needed to get done that day that was like automatically being pulled in from like a help desk system and all the stuff that was really basic
Little task things I was like automated like my job was I had everything running into a spreadsheet of like different things that needed to get done that day that was like automatically being pulled in from like a help desk system and all the stuff that was really basic Like literally it just read the spreadsheet and then said oh well there's a script that does that plug these values into that script run now it's done now send that email off okay cool everything is done and I would just hit okay and then walk around the building and it was like I used to get in trouble so much because they're like why are you not working and it was like
Like literally it just read the spreadsheet and then said oh well there's a script that does that plug these values into that script run now it's done now send that email off okay cool everything is done and I would just hit okay and then walk around the building and it was like I used to get in trouble so much because they're like why are you not working and it was like Because I am working and it's easier for me not to touch my computer and let my computer do the work then it is if I'm like I'm like not at my desk so yeah like Python definitely is not just for data science is not just for web development is not just for backend is not just for
Because I am working and it's easier for me not to touch my computer and let my computer do the work then it is if I'm like I'm like not at my desk so yeah like Python definitely is not just for data science is not just for web development is not just for backend is not just for Any of like all of those things like you can do a lot with Python in fact if you're just like i'm sure I could write a program that does this usually there is a way to do it in Python may not be the fastest way but there is a way and it should be pretty fast
Any of like all of those things like you can do a lot with Python in fact if you're just like i'm sure I could write a program that does this usually there is a way to do it in Python may not be the fastest way but there is a way and it should be pretty fast And this is probably something I am most excited about is chapter 17 18 because helping build communities and learning the backend of that I was like
And this is probably something I am most excited about is chapter 17 18 because helping build communities and learning the backend of that I was like I just want automated emails yet you know you can only learn so much in different direction all at once so i'm very excited to be able to go through that later on and start building that out because it's like something that I could see really does help
I just want automated emails yet you know you can only learn so much in different direction all at once so i'm very excited to be able to go through that later on and start building that out because it's like something that I could see really does help And you don't have to stick to one language Aaron joined in of they started on the data side and data journalism cleaning up data sets now doing more apps stuff with Python and some machine learning stuff which is new
And you don't have to stick to one language Aaron joined in of they started on the data side and data journalism cleaning up data sets now doing more apps stuff with Python and some machine learning stuff which is new And then they didn't even know till like a year ago that you can build apps and Python. Not going to lie I don't think i've seen too many apps yet
And then they didn't even know till like a year ago that you can build apps and Python. Not going to lie I don't think i've seen too many apps yet So usually when you're working with something like that it is you are writing Python to a translation layer that like writes it in some other host language
So usually when you're working with something like that it is you are writing Python to a translation layer that like writes it in some other host language But you can do the underlying things in Python so like a lot of a lot of like the UI might be in some other language but then it's calling your Python scripts to run in the backend
But you can do the underlying things in Python so like a lot of a lot of like the UI might be in some other language but then it's calling your Python scripts to run in the backend And I mean like as we talk about things like pyscript pyscript allows you to just run Python in the browser so like if you have
And I mean like as we talk about things like pyscript pyscript allows you to just run Python in the browser so like if you have I want this Python code up on the screen and I wanted to do Python things it's not you know HTML and CSS it is just full on Python and like to me that's it's it's awesome and it's still really early but we're going to see a lot of development and growth
I want this Python code up on the screen and I wanted to do Python things it's not you know HTML and CSS it is just full on Python and like to me that's it's it's awesome and it's still really early but we're going to see a lot of development and growth So I'm going to talk about the Python and the web assembly space for Python in the next few years in fact there are actually some Python enhancement proposals or peps was i'm sure you'll hear about if you continue learning Python you'll hear about the peps system and all of that
So I'm going to talk about the Python and the web assembly space for Python in the next few years in fact there are actually some Python enhancement proposals or peps was i'm sure you'll hear about if you continue learning Python you'll hear about the peps system and all of that So right now that talk about increasing support for wasm was web assembly it kind of the same thing I don't remember what all of the the SNMR but web assembly is when you hear wasm be thinking like web assembly in that case. There is a lot to break down there I
So right now that talk about increasing support for wasm was web assembly it kind of the same thing I don't remember what all of the the SNMR but web assembly is when you hear wasm be thinking like web assembly in that case. There is a lot to break down there I So first question that comes to mind is and this is me not knowing my tools yet and I call that out because
So first question that comes to mind is and this is me not knowing my tools yet and I call that out because Jay and I started late today because we were all asked I was asking a lot of questions about the learning processes and this is something that's pretty cool that we've been doing a lot with Laura yet i'm excited that we're doing this with a ton of other people is does dev tools tell you what language things are in
Jay and I started late today because we were all asked I was asking a lot of questions about the learning processes and this is something that's pretty cool that we've been doing a lot with Laura yet i'm excited that we're doing this with a ton of other people is does dev tools tell you what language things are in So you just talked about be able to see it in the browser and i'm like i don't remember dev tools say not but I don't know if it does not not like right out of the box there are extensions that you can use let me see if I can i don't know if there is a pie script
So you just talked about be able to see it in the browser and i'm like i don't remember dev tools say not but I don't know if it does not not like right out of the box there are extensions that you can use let me see if I can i don't know if there is a pie script Like extension but because for example i'm going to go to some random one I have and get hub it will show you like the languages people are using which I have found really really helpful
Like extension but because for example i'm going to go to some random one I have and get hub it will show you like the languages people are using which I have found really really helpful Yeah, if I just go to inspect the page and go look at something it doesn't really tell me that much and that's why I was curious if it's something like those can complement each other or if it's something that there was a plugin for
Yeah, if I just go to inspect the page and go look at something it doesn't really tell me that much and that's why I was curious if it's something like those can complement each other or if it's something that there was a plugin for They're usually plugins so like there's like the react like and that's the one that I always think of is like react basically builds your website inside what's called a virtual DOM or domain object mapper thing and
They're usually plugins so like there's like the react like and that's the one that I always think of is like react basically builds your website inside what's called a virtual DOM or domain object mapper thing and You can see the footprint or the fingerprint of those things in your HTML in the HTML that it creates
You can see the footprint or the fingerprint of those things in your HTML in the HTML that it creates So when you are able to see those things it allows you to be able to go and like pull information from it so you do have extensions that'll say like oh this is built with view I know this is built with view I can then give you access to the the layer
So when you are able to see those things it allows you to be able to go and like pull information from it so you do have extensions that'll say like oh this is built with view I know this is built with view I can then give you access to the the layer It's a layer that is view or the layer that is react and use that as a way to kind of pull that information out document object model thank you see this is why i'm not a JavaScript developer. Okay so that's what JavaScript uses yet is there something like that for Python
It's a layer that is view or the layer that is react and use that as a way to kind of pull that information out document object model thank you see this is why i'm not a JavaScript developer. Okay so that's what JavaScript uses yet is there something like that for Python I don't know entirely how I put a link to the pie script project i'm not entirely sure how it's generating it but i'm pretty sure there's like some web assembly embedded layer like they have like a Python runtime that's embedded in each page that it pulls from and then goes but that is
I don't know entirely how I put a link to the pie script project i'm not entirely sure how it's generating it but i'm pretty sure there's like some web assembly embedded layer like they have like a Python runtime that's embedded in each page that it pulls from and then goes but that is Again there's a lot happening with that and kind of the next step in that space is like how do you how do you kind of. extract that and be able to show it to other people but again this is this is like if you want to be in this area
Again there's a lot happening with that and kind of the next step in that space is like how do you how do you kind of. extract that and be able to show it to other people but again this is this is like if you want to be in this area This is like a whole thing and this is kind of the direction that a lot of active development is going in how do we how do we do more Python in more places and
This is like a whole thing and this is kind of the direction that a lot of active development is going in how do we how do we do more Python in more places and Again, this is like a lot of houses like Python with JavaScript of bidirectional communication between Python and JavaScript objects so like you can write JavaScript and then pass the out the results of that JavaScript into your Python and then like do Python things with it and vice versa
Again, this is like a lot of houses like Python with JavaScript of bidirectional communication between Python and JavaScript objects so like you can write JavaScript and then pass the out the results of that JavaScript into your Python and then like do Python things with it and vice versa Don't don't don't try to wrap your head too much around it's reminding me of bedrock and bedrock does your each your CSS in your HTML so that way and it just reminding me kind of like of that because it does the two together instead of and
Don't don't don't try to wrap your head too much around it's reminding me of bedrock and bedrock does your each your CSS in your HTML so that way and it just reminding me kind of like of that because it does the two together instead of and Okay, y'all I know that I am asking way too many questions and like going off on a tangent so
Okay, y'all I know that I am asking way too many questions and like going off on a tangent so Oh yes, he used Docker or a Jupyter notebook or Kaggle when writing Python so GitHub is kind of like I'm not sure like if you do Python things and until I did a text skills test with a recruiter they're like is there a way to make that more visible and GitHub
Oh yes, he used Docker or a Jupyter notebook or Kaggle when writing Python so GitHub is kind of like I'm not sure like if you do Python things and until I did a text skills test with a recruiter they're like is there a way to make that more visible and GitHub I don't really know that's a that's a good question I think that there are there are definitely ways that like you can take your your project and like if you're working in Docker
I don't really know that's a that's a good question I think that there are there are definitely ways that like you can take your your project and like if you're working in Docker Don't just have like that image in Docker hub and then like the underlying code not in GitHub put that underlying code and get up that way people can see it now if you're using like someone else's like Docker project and you're like doing a bunch of stuff and they're running in that honestly that's more that's more valuable than writing the Python yourself you know what to write and what the other people write for you and and I respect that in terms of like Jupyter notebooks if well this is a
Don't just have like that image in Docker hub and then like the underlying code not in GitHub put that underlying code and get up that way people can see it now if you're using like someone else's like Docker project and you're like doing a bunch of stuff and they're running in that honestly that's more that's more valuable than writing the Python yourself you know what to write and what the other people write for you and and I respect that in terms of like Jupyter notebooks if well this is a This is the whole like recruiter versus engineer type thing if the recruiter is like oh I don't see you do a lot of Python things and use it say like I have all these Jupyter notebooks over here that have Python in it and they're like oh well that's not Python then
This is the whole like recruiter versus engineer type thing if the recruiter is like oh I don't see you do a lot of Python things and use it say like I have all these Jupyter notebooks over here that have Python in it and they're like oh well that's not Python then Just be like it depends like if you know the engineering team cool just be like sure whatever I talked to so and so and this is a valuable skill set or this is a trade or just explain to them that it is and if they
Just be like it depends like if you know the engineering team cool just be like sure whatever I talked to so and so and this is a valuable skill set or this is a trade or just explain to them that it is and if they My guess is this is possibly a a let's just white dude that's like yeah I go to Python meetups all the time and it's like yeah i'm not i'm not here to bash recruiting recruiting is a job just as much as engineering is a job they have their skill sets and they have the things that
My guess is this is possibly a a let's just white dude that's like yeah I go to Python meetups all the time and it's like yeah i'm not i'm not here to bash recruiting recruiting is a job just as much as engineering is a job they have their skill sets and they have the things that That are blind spots in their skill sets both of them so how do we. How do we kind of get beyond those blind spots just so that we can get to the people that we want to be interacting with. Follow up questions on this and this is something that we talked about with Laura last time about Jupyter
That are blind spots in their skill sets both of them so how do we. How do we kind of get beyond those blind spots just so that we can get to the people that we want to be interacting with. Follow up questions on this and this is something that we talked about with Laura last time about Jupyter Jupyter notebooks and y'all again I am still learning a lot of the theory of the coding first like I it took me a while to wrap my head around a bullion so just so that way you kind of know where I am i'm working on a lot of theory I haven't done a lot on typing or like writing it out and
Jupyter notebooks and y'all again I am still learning a lot of the theory of the coding first like I it took me a while to wrap my head around a bullion so just so that way you kind of know where I am i'm working on a lot of theory I haven't done a lot on typing or like writing it out and So can you would you not or could you not put. Your Jupyter notebook on a repo for backup yeah of course again yeah you can you can absolutely take like if I have a Jupyter notebook and I want to just throw the whole notebook in GitHub like yeah absolutely you can do that
So can you would you not or could you not put. Your Jupyter notebook on a repo for backup yeah of course again yeah you can you can absolutely take like if I have a Jupyter notebook and I want to just throw the whole notebook in GitHub like yeah absolutely you can do that And actually GitHub has a pretty good interface of presenting that. And great question from Fukai and I feel like I haven't seen you for a while so i'm excited to see you back. Doesn't the source code of the notebooks count as Python sounds like a GitHub bug to be honest I wonder if there is
And actually GitHub has a pretty good interface of presenting that. And great question from Fukai and I feel like I haven't seen you for a while so i'm excited to see you back. Doesn't the source code of the notebooks count as Python sounds like a GitHub bug to be honest I wonder if there is Like like yes and you you may not actually want to include like all of the embedded like notebook source code stuff into your repo so that wouldn't be visible to GitHub. Like my guess is like you would have a requirement dots dot txt file that has
Like like yes and you you may not actually want to include like all of the embedded like notebook source code stuff into your repo so that wouldn't be visible to GitHub. Like my guess is like you would have a requirement dots dot txt file that has All of the like oh piff install notebooks and all that stuff and you wouldn't want to include like your virtual environment that has those Python libraries. And that's just how do Jupyter notebooks backup then
All of the like oh piff install notebooks and all that stuff and you wouldn't want to include like your virtual environment that has those Python libraries. And that's just how do Jupyter notebooks backup then Because it would store an actual file and then when you run the Jupyter notebook it will just read that file and say oh I know how to present this inside of a notebook. Because that's why it's an iPad but is it IP YNB file like interactive Python notebook file so like that file
Because it would store an actual file and then when you run the Jupyter notebook it will just read that file and say oh I know how to present this inside of a notebook. Because that's why it's an iPad but is it IP YNB file like interactive Python notebook file so like that file Just has all of the markup that your notebook quote unquote server like will read and from there it generates that visual layer that people are used to
Just has all of the markup that your notebook quote unquote server like will read and from there it generates that visual layer that people are used to It goes oh let me see this file okay cool add some stuff and then when you type into it it writes to that file and if you've ever tried to look at an i at a pi and B file. It is definitely not just Python it is like Python at a bunch of like markup so you have to
It goes oh let me see this file okay cool add some stuff and then when you type into it it writes to that file and if you've ever tried to look at an i at a pi and B file. It is definitely not just Python it is like Python at a bunch of like markup so you have to That's why i'm kind of like it should even say like i'm pretty sure GitHub recognizes i pi and B files and it says like oh you do Jupyter notebook things
That's why i'm kind of like it should even say like i'm pretty sure GitHub recognizes i pi and B files and it says like oh you do Jupyter notebook things And from there like to me if someone who is like i'm looking for someone with Python knowledge and they see Jupyter notebooks in your repo as like the type of language that you're using
And from there like to me if someone who is like i'm looking for someone with Python knowledge and they see Jupyter notebooks in your repo as like the type of language that you're using They should be able to look at that and tell like okay this person probably does some Python things not to say that you only do Python things in Jupyter notebooks you can do a lot of different languages in Jupyter notebooks but
They should be able to look at that and tell like okay this person probably does some Python things not to say that you only do Python things in Jupyter notebooks you can do a lot of different languages in Jupyter notebooks but For the most part Python tends to be kind of the language that a lot of people use and if you're using something like a. P Y and B file then you are 100% doing Python unless you're just doing all mark down our text but seems like a lot when you can just do that so
For the most part Python tends to be kind of the language that a lot of people use and if you're using something like a. P Y and B file then you are 100% doing Python unless you're just doing all mark down our text but seems like a lot when you can just do that so You answered my question but I don't think I said what I meant okay is like so if you're not backing it up a file on GitHub does Jupyter notebook back it up somewhere else like a GitHub like I guess how do you. Is it just saving it on your computer instead of backing it up somewhere
You answered my question but I don't think I said what I meant okay is like so if you're not backing it up a file on GitHub does Jupyter notebook back it up somewhere else like a GitHub like I guess how do you. Is it just saving it on your computer instead of backing it up somewhere Yeah so yeah you. Yeah there is no I mean i'm sure someone has some app somewhere that's like oh store all your Jupyter notebooks here but like that that is i'm not going to say GitHub i'm going to say that is some type of version control system running in the background specifically designed for
Yeah so yeah you. Yeah there is no I mean i'm sure someone has some app somewhere that's like oh store all your Jupyter notebooks here but like that that is i'm not going to say GitHub i'm going to say that is some type of version control system running in the background specifically designed for Scientific notebooks or Jupyter notebooks okay so it's not something that automatically happens it's something that okay okay cool because. Those who I don't know is those who may not know Anthony I like to call him my internet big brother. Camp Polo I still call him Anthony
Scientific notebooks or Jupyter notebooks okay so it's not something that automatically happens it's something that okay okay cool because. Those who I don't know is those who may not know Anthony I like to call him my internet big brother. Camp Polo I still call him Anthony AJC or AJC webbed of AJC webbed of this is how I call him that is his last name. Not his official last name with him being one of the first people that
AJC or AJC webbed of AJC webbed of this is how I call him that is his last name. Not his official last name with him being one of the first people that Talked me about just like process in general he told me about going through and like as soon as you get you're done with something you uploaded on as a repo and then you delete it from your computer
Talked me about just like process in general he told me about going through and like as soon as you get you're done with something you uploaded on as a repo and then you delete it from your computer So that's where I think I was just going like wait what how what's going on that's one way to do it yeah I mean storage is cheap I have most of my project still sitting on my computer somewhere but
So that's where I think I was just going like wait what how what's going on that's one way to do it yeah I mean storage is cheap I have most of my project still sitting on my computer somewhere but I think the focus there is like yes have have some form of get layer like some form of like workflow that you use that puts things not just on your computer and like it's a mon get up but of course with that there is also the like do it in the way that's safe and also do it in a way that's
I think the focus there is like yes have have some form of get layer like some form of like workflow that you use that puts things not just on your computer and like it's a mon get up but of course with that there is also the like do it in the way that's safe and also do it in a way that's Oh that's not going to
Oh that's not going to Add a bunch of unnecessary components to it as well so you don't want and then we talked about this will like a get ignore you don't want your environment file with all of your keys and passwords and like all those things in there like you absolutely want to present don't want that
Add a bunch of unnecessary components to it as well so you don't want and then we talked about this will like a get ignore you don't want your environment file with all of your keys and passwords and like all those things in there like you absolutely want to present don't want that And you don't want it to include every single piece of your Python virtual environment instead you want just your code and then if you have things like a certain environment that you want to enforce you do something like a dev container that
And you don't want it to include every single piece of your Python virtual environment instead you want just your code and then if you have things like a certain environment that you want to enforce you do something like a dev container that Tells the person that's going to look at your code what they need and even give them a way to quickly add it but doesn't include it in your repo otherwise what you might be doing is every time you go to add something to get up you're adding like megabytes and megabytes and megabytes and as things change
Tells the person that's going to look at your code what they need and even give them a way to quickly add it but doesn't include it in your repo otherwise what you might be doing is every time you go to add something to get up you're adding like megabytes and megabytes and megabytes and as things change Like get has to track all of that so eventually your project becomes this unwieldy beast that takes forever to to load and get off the ground
Like get has to track all of that so eventually your project becomes this unwieldy beast that takes forever to to load and get off the ground Containers are yeah I don't know what what okay y'all I get that we were going to talk about chapters we may not get to chapter two I have so many other questions we can do chapter two we can we can get all in there like I can come back anytime and talk about
Containers are yeah I don't know what what okay y'all I get that we were going to talk about chapters we may not get to chapter two I have so many other questions we can do chapter two we can we can get all in there like I can come back anytime and talk about All the fun stuff yes yeah this is something that is is i'm learning a lot and I think it's this is one of the difficult things with learning to code is it's also a lot of project i'm calling a project hygiene i don't know if that's the proper way of saying it like what do you do with your your content and okay
All the fun stuff yes yeah this is something that is is i'm learning a lot and I think it's this is one of the difficult things with learning to code is it's also a lot of project i'm calling a project hygiene i don't know if that's the proper way of saying it like what do you do with your your content and okay What are learning containers oh sorry just just containers so. This is this is a topic that I am not prepared to talk. I know there we go Aaron what are you doing are you going to jump on the stream with us you know talk about containers because i'm curious
What are learning containers oh sorry just just containers so. This is this is a topic that I am not prepared to talk. I know there we go Aaron what are you doing are you going to jump on the stream with us you know talk about containers because i'm curious Containerization is one of those things that you I feel like at this point you will learn. There are a few oh I like that it's like a mini space it's like a mini space yeah think about that okay so
Containerization is one of those things that you I feel like at this point you will learn. There are a few oh I like that it's like a mini space it's like a mini space yeah think about that okay so Think about where you live think about I don't like your home your home has a bunch of different rooms in it that all that do different things right. But they all have a few things in common they have four walls they have a ceiling and a floor and probably a door so that you can get in and out
Think about where you live think about I don't like your home your home has a bunch of different rooms in it that all that do different things right. But they all have a few things in common they have four walls they have a ceiling and a floor and probably a door so that you can get in and out i'm going to go back to what Foucai said but. Just to keep on the conversation we're going with it's like a soon's neighborhood that i'm trying to keep the analogy really small here so. I don't want to fuck up the other yes. I find this really funny because I never got into Sims
i'm going to go back to what Foucai said but. Just to keep on the conversation we're going with it's like a soon's neighborhood that i'm trying to keep the analogy really small here so. I don't want to fuck up the other yes. I find this really funny because I never got into Sims I got so agitated at Sims and so that's why I was like this is this is really funny but it's like a mini space so let's go back to the apartment
I got so agitated at Sims and so that's why I was like this is this is really funny but it's like a mini space so let's go back to the apartment So yeah I think an apartment or a house or whatever like a bathroom has certain things in it has a toilet has a sink it has a bathtub or a shower right so like all of those things are included in a bathroom
So yeah I think an apartment or a house or whatever like a bathroom has certain things in it has a toilet has a sink it has a bathtub or a shower right so like all of those things are included in a bathroom And then when you get another bathroom what do you do you make sure that you have a sink to toilet maybe a shower or a bathtub so you don't have to think about like. Every time I have a I need a bathroom let me go
And then when you get another bathroom what do you do you make sure that you have a sink to toilet maybe a shower or a bathtub so you don't have to think about like. Every time I have a I need a bathroom let me go Think about the concept of a bathroom from scratch all over again you go no these bathrooms are a thing so we're just going to copy and paste bathroom there bathroom has been copy and pasted that is ultimately what like a container is in many cases it is
Think about the concept of a bathroom from scratch all over again you go no these bathrooms are a thing so we're just going to copy and paste bathroom there bathroom has been copy and pasted that is ultimately what like a container is in many cases it is If I have a Python project there are certain things that I need for my Python project to run and that scale so if I have a Django project which is Django is a Python web framework
If I have a Python project there are certain things that I need for my Python project to run and that scale so if I have a Django project which is Django is a Python web framework That I need to have all of these things for my Django project to run if I have this let me think if I have this web idea this web project that is two databases the web framework the API layer the JavaScript front end those are four different those are five different servers that all have to run
That I need to have all of these things for my Django project to run if I have this let me think if I have this web idea this web project that is two databases the web framework the API layer the JavaScript front end those are four different those are five different servers that all have to run And I now need to replicate that across to another project I don't want to have to build all of that from scratch luckily there may be a container already that has all of those things included that I can go
And I now need to replicate that across to another project I don't want to have to build all of that from scratch luckily there may be a container already that has all of those things included that I can go Let me just grab that and then that's there and I give it the things that do make it different the wallpaper maybe how the sink looks maybe what you actually put in the cabinet but ultimately it's all the things that you needed to make this an effective space or an effective project
Let me just grab that and then that's there and I give it the things that do make it different the wallpaper maybe how the sink looks maybe what you actually put in the cabinet but ultimately it's all the things that you needed to make this an effective space or an effective project Yay we will have content of like to follow up on thank you Aaron. Okay so rolling it back some of learning containers we are still talking about like containers like Docker. Yeah
Yay we will have content of like to follow up on thank you Aaron. Okay so rolling it back some of learning containers we are still talking about like containers like Docker. Yeah Yeah. Okay okay and the way that you just so can you find containers that could be like a template kind of like what you were just talking about yeah that's your base image that's your image so Docker requires you to create or
Yeah. Okay okay and the way that you just so can you find containers that could be like a template kind of like what you were just talking about yeah that's your base image that's your image so Docker requires you to create or Pull from what's called an image and that image is all of is that template so you might say like I want to operate within like a base image that is just Python 311 alpine or Python 311 what's the one that we're supposed to use now bullseye that is like if you're developing and you just need a clean Python like
Pull from what's called an image and that image is all of is that template so you might say like I want to operate within like a base image that is just Python 311 alpine or Python 311 what's the one that we're supposed to use now bullseye that is like if you're developing and you just need a clean Python like Space that is this image here and you just pull that image. Okay and then when you're using containers you don't need something like get hub because container is virtually backed up
Space that is this image here and you just pull that image. Okay and then when you're using containers you don't need something like get hub because container is virtually backed up I mean it has to live somewhere so yeah like Docker hub is a place and it is effectively like the space where all the Docker images that people decide to put there go to live it's the Docker what I call the Docker senior community center. That's just me on me though. But okay
I mean it has to live somewhere so yeah like Docker hub is a place and it is effectively like the space where all the Docker images that people decide to put there go to live it's the Docker what I call the Docker senior community center. That's just me on me though. But okay It yeah like get hub you can store images and get hub there's a get hub container registry you can have your own special place for things like I mean I disclosure again I work I work for Microsoft my job is to promote Azure if you have your own set of images that you want to be the basis for like your big project
It yeah like get hub you can store images and get hub there's a get hub container registry you can have your own special place for things like I mean I disclosure again I work I work for Microsoft my job is to promote Azure if you have your own set of images that you want to be the basis for like your big project And think about how important this is for things like banking or businesses where you often are spinning up and tearing down servers because they need to serve a purpose like oh hey
And think about how important this is for things like banking or businesses where you often are spinning up and tearing down servers because they need to serve a purpose like oh hey You know I have the the quote unquote big game or whatever is coming up this week and now you have all these companies that will put out commercials and they need people they like they're going to go to a website the website is going to crash because billions of people are going to go visit it
You know I have the the quote unquote big game or whatever is coming up this week and now you have all these companies that will put out commercials and they need people they like they're going to go to a website the website is going to crash because billions of people are going to go visit it So what you do is you have this scalable containerization project that is like my the thing that serves my website is an image and it is in this container and if I need more of those containers to serve that website to more people
So what you do is you have this scalable containerization project that is like my the thing that serves my website is an image and it is in this container and if I need more of those containers to serve that website to more people I don't have to rebuild it all the time I just say give me another one of those and then give me another one of those or give me 15 of those and
I don't have to rebuild it all the time I just say give me another one of those and then give me another one of those or give me 15 of those and There are even technologies that you'll you'll hear about eventually like Kubernetes that gets really involved in managing the adding and removing of those containers as needed. I was going to say like Aaron I know you just said you're going to reach out to Jay for a collab but like
There are even technologies that you'll you'll hear about eventually like Kubernetes that gets really involved in managing the adding and removing of those containers as needed. I was going to say like Aaron I know you just said you're going to reach out to Jay for a collab but like When y'all like collab at some point it would be really cool for y'all and I have another person
When y'all like collab at some point it would be really cool for y'all and I have another person Trevor who does a lot of work with us to you would be really cool if y'all could just like write out or like do a stream on Azure versus power show versus Kubernetes versus Docker versus AWS like what are these terms yeah
Trevor who does a lot of work with us to you would be really cool if y'all could just like write out or like do a stream on Azure versus power show versus Kubernetes versus Docker versus AWS like what are these terms yeah Because aren't they all kind of just there is server well Azure and AWS are serverless right and then the other three are. Well
Because aren't they all kind of just there is server well Azure and AWS are serverless right and then the other three are. Well Well. No Azure and AWS are just cloud like think of those as just cloud providers ultimately they do a lot of the same things they might just do them different ways and they're backed by different companies
Well. No Azure and AWS are just cloud like think of those as just cloud providers ultimately they do a lot of the same things they might just do them different ways and they're backed by different companies Azure obviously is the Microsoft are about cloud flare cloud flare probably doesn't do as much as AWS or Azure but probably does some similar things
Azure obviously is the Microsoft are about cloud flare cloud flare probably doesn't do as much as AWS or Azure but probably does some similar things So like cloud flare probably gives you they are there are CDN layer right so they'll have some like CDN stuff which is for site reliability they'll also have
So like cloud flare probably gives you they are there are CDN layer right so they'll have some like CDN stuff which is for site reliability they'll also have So learning that they do more than I thought they did I thought they just did the CDN and I'm like every time I've talked about one of these. The engineers are like no we do more than that yeah yeah they do they do CDN they do web hosting they do DNS they do a lot of those things
So learning that they do more than I thought they did I thought they just did the CDN and I'm like every time I've talked about one of these. The engineers are like no we do more than that yeah yeah they do they do CDN they do web hosting they do DNS they do a lot of those things But when you look at something like an AWS which has like 200 some odd services like they do so many things it's ridiculous
But when you look at something like an AWS which has like 200 some odd services like they do so many things it's ridiculous Azure as well I I kind of focus on the like quickly deploy Python projects in Azure but if you wanted to go into like other spaces of Azure they totally exist also most of these companies partner with other companies
Azure as well I I kind of focus on the like quickly deploy Python projects in Azure but if you wanted to go into like other spaces of Azure they totally exist also most of these companies partner with other companies So if you want to have like I used to work in elastic that's where Aaron knows me from so like if you want to host your elastic infrastructure on AWS you can do that if you want to host on Azure you can do that it's all the same product it's just where that product lives
So if you want to have like I used to work in elastic that's where Aaron knows me from so like if you want to host your elastic infrastructure on AWS you can do that if you want to host on Azure you can do that it's all the same product it's just where that product lives And there are multiple ways that you can do that you can go through elastics cloud offering that just focuses on what they do and say hey let me do all my elastic stuff over here but store all of my stuff in Azure or store all of my stuff in GCP or store all of my stuff in AWS or you can go to AWS or Azure or GCP and say let me spin up an elastic cloud layer and then we'll do it that way too so and that's something that like I don't think you can go to cloud flare and be like yo how do I get this entire application that's running Kubernetes on the back end but has been obfuscated so that end users don't have to worry about that
And there are multiple ways that you can do that you can go through elastics cloud offering that just focuses on what they do and say hey let me do all my elastic stuff over here but store all of my stuff in Azure or store all of my stuff in GCP or store all of my stuff in AWS or you can go to AWS or Azure or GCP and say let me spin up an elastic cloud layer and then we'll do it that way too so and that's something that like I don't think you can go to cloud flare and be like yo how do I get this entire application that's running Kubernetes on the back end but has been obfuscated so that end users don't have to worry about that And how do I put that on cloud flare you don't that's that's the answers that you just don't
And how do I put that on cloud flare you don't that's that's the answers that you just don't I like this answer of cloud flare has similar things a very high focus on routing CDN proxy in but lately focus a lot on running your own projects on every server park and the entire yes Aaron I definitely want to go do things
I like this answer of cloud flare has similar things a very high focus on routing CDN proxy in but lately focus a lot on running your own projects on every server park and the entire yes Aaron I definitely want to go do things But this hosting part and this is like something that took me a very long time and added to this question that I probably shouldn't have asked but I'm glad I did because I used to work at go daddy so we did hosting there you know it like started to make sense servers all of that but then you have like netlify and or sell and it's like
But this hosting part and this is like something that took me a very long time and added to this question that I probably shouldn't have asked but I'm glad I did because I used to work at go daddy so we did hosting there you know it like started to make sense servers all of that but then you have like netlify and or sell and it's like You can host things very easily what it's like what what. So think of all of these providers as often services that ultimately do the same thing but slightly different and being really good at doing one particular thing one or more particular things
You can host things very easily what it's like what what. So think of all of these providers as often services that ultimately do the same thing but slightly different and being really good at doing one particular thing one or more particular things AWS just has a lion share of the space so like if you want to go work at a lot of companies like it just understanding how AWS not even works but like the space in which you're doing your job
AWS just has a lion share of the space so like if you want to go work at a lot of companies like it just understanding how AWS not even works but like the space in which you're doing your job And understanding how you do that in AWS is probably a thing that you should have some knowledge of and then again I think the more foundational knowledge you have the easier it is to take that one thing and then go somewhere else if you're talking about a netlify or a sell like Aaron said a lot of netlify and brosel is I have this JavaScript project or I have this static web app and I want to host it extremely cheap or I have a very very simple project that is doing a thing that I don't want to pay a lot of money for so when you talk about like cloud providers one of the things that becomes a challenge is how do I set this up in a way that I'm not going to be spending hundreds of dollars because when we think about this it's a it's a scale problem like Azure has to be able to operate and handle you know Wal-Mart's website and shopping platform and things like that your website doesn't need all of that so when you go to something like an Azure and this is a thing that we're trying to make better this is why like this is why they hire people like me is like we want to make it so that it is as easy as using a brosel or a netlify but at the end of the day it's going to a lot of the thing that we're doing is like we have to worry about both sides of that coin, brosel and netlify focus more on the smaller projects and then once they start scaling to beyond what brosel and netlify are comfortable with what you start seeing is that bill gets it goes from five dollars to hold that's a lot of money and then from there you're like okay wait a minute
And understanding how you do that in AWS is probably a thing that you should have some knowledge of and then again I think the more foundational knowledge you have the easier it is to take that one thing and then go somewhere else if you're talking about a netlify or a sell like Aaron said a lot of netlify and brosel is I have this JavaScript project or I have this static web app and I want to host it extremely cheap or I have a very very simple project that is doing a thing that I don't want to pay a lot of money for so when you talk about like cloud providers one of the things that becomes a challenge is how do I set this up in a way that I'm not going to be spending hundreds of dollars because when we think about this it's a it's a scale problem like Azure has to be able to operate and handle you know Wal-Mart's website and shopping platform and things like that your website doesn't need all of that so when you go to something like an Azure and this is a thing that we're trying to make better this is why like this is why they hire people like me is like we want to make it so that it is as easy as using a brosel or a netlify but at the end of the day it's going to a lot of the thing that we're doing is like we have to worry about both sides of that coin, brosel and netlify focus more on the smaller projects and then once they start scaling to beyond what brosel and netlify are comfortable with what you start seeing is that bill gets it goes from five dollars to hold that's a lot of money and then from there you're like okay wait a minute i'm trying to do this thing in a service that isn't really designed to do that thing they want you to do that thing there because that's how they make a ton of money but maybe it's easier to move it over to like one of the larger club providers that are going to have different pricing options and different scalable tiers and things like that
i'm trying to do this thing in a service that isn't really designed to do that thing they want you to do that thing there because that's how they make a ton of money but maybe it's easier to move it over to like one of the larger club providers that are going to have different pricing options and different scalable tiers and things like that okay and this is a great. Explanation but one of the down the fire or brosel uses clout for underneath for all of their services. No yeah a lot of higher okay so yeah it's it's definitely like this is a
okay and this is a great. Explanation but one of the down the fire or brosel uses clout for underneath for all of their services. No yeah a lot of higher okay so yeah it's it's definitely like this is a it's abstraction i like the word is abstraction of wiki that's that's a really good way to talk about it is like hey
it's abstraction i like the word is abstraction of wiki that's that's a really good way to talk about it is like hey Cloud is hard we recognize it cloud is hard would it would just be easier if I could just give you my file and it works and then some service comes in and says yeah you can do that here and then they build they build the piece that that moves things over. i'm reading myself notes. yeah
Cloud is hard we recognize it cloud is hard would it would just be easier if I could just give you my file and it works and then some service comes in and says yeah you can do that here and then they build they build the piece that that moves things over. i'm reading myself notes. yeah yeah. you bring me over for python and then we start talking about cloud native which i'm like not an expert in in any way shape or form. What I think of containers I think of like dev containers which uses containers but is like. On the development side not on the like production side
yeah. you bring me over for python and then we start talking about cloud native which i'm like not an expert in in any way shape or form. What I think of containers I think of like dev containers which uses containers but is like. On the development side not on the like production side And I think these conversations are great. It doesn't offer you much control as you idiot okay yeah okay so it's it's this is the crazy thing and I think one of the hard things is when you're learning something new at least for myself
And I think these conversations are great. It doesn't offer you much control as you idiot okay yeah okay so it's it's this is the crazy thing and I think one of the hard things is when you're learning something new at least for myself Without understanding the big picture and makes it very very difficult for me to learn the basics. Especially with like for some people that may have like a little bit of knowledge in. Like areas like I used to work at go daddy so I want to compare everything to go daddy
Without understanding the big picture and makes it very very difficult for me to learn the basics. Especially with like for some people that may have like a little bit of knowledge in. Like areas like I used to work at go daddy so I want to compare everything to go daddy I'm not going to be a good person to go and do a lot of work or WordPress and they you know I might know something there so it's. No that's that's actually a really good way to look at it too because go daddy
I'm not going to be a good person to go and do a lot of work or WordPress and they you know I might know something there so it's. No that's that's actually a really good way to look at it too because go daddy And a lot of those these were like vps these are like the early day web host providers of like. And then you know have to build your entire house and what WordPress did was like all right cool we're going to give we're going to basically give you a model home and then you just decorate the inside
And a lot of those these were like vps these are like the early day web host providers of like. And then you know have to build your entire house and what WordPress did was like all right cool we're going to give we're going to basically give you a model home and then you just decorate the inside And then what these other services said were like all right we're going to give you a container home and if you want more space you just add more containers
And then what these other services said were like all right we're going to give you a container home and if you want more space you just add more containers It is ultimately kind of that same space it's just how we've we've handled it and as someone who used to be a sys admin like I appreciate this a lot because I hated having to build my own web like build a website
It is ultimately kind of that same space it's just how we've we've handled it and as someone who used to be a sys admin like I appreciate this a lot because I hated having to build my own web like build a website And then think about all of the stuff that goes into building a website that is not the website of like all right I need to spin up this Linux server then I need to set up like author is like all of the security stuff on that and then I got to keep that server up to date and then if I need another server for another thing I have to do all of that stuff again which is a nightmare and then people were like oh containerization now you just pull these templates out
And then think about all of the stuff that goes into building a website that is not the website of like all right I need to spin up this Linux server then I need to set up like author is like all of the security stuff on that and then I got to keep that server up to date and then if I need another server for another thing I have to do all of that stuff again which is a nightmare and then people were like oh containerization now you just pull these templates out Now you just have to focus on keeping the template up to date which is fine because it's a lot easier to do
Now you just have to focus on keeping the template up to date which is fine because it's a lot easier to do Yeah then there's engine x configuration which never works and then you got to figure out whiskey and asynchronous whiskey and so many other things and yeah it's it's a lot of stuff that you don't want to have to deal with and it becomes really expensive so when you can say like oh kind of like this stream
Yeah then there's engine x configuration which never works and then you got to figure out whiskey and asynchronous whiskey and so many other things and yeah it's it's a lot of stuff that you don't want to have to deal with and it becomes really expensive so when you can say like oh kind of like this stream We can just have a bunch of people that know Python and they just write Python code and then they commit their Python code to the cloud get hub or wherever and a bunch of automated systems take over and make sure that that produces some big project that's that's where we're trying to get to and that's kind of where we are now
We can just have a bunch of people that know Python and they just write Python code and then they commit their Python code to the cloud get hub or wherever and a bunch of automated systems take over and make sure that that produces some big project that's that's where we're trying to get to and that's kind of where we are now And we've maybe we'll get to Python chapter two because this is you know all questions that do lead to it too of going back a little bit before like talking about these learning containers was the like project hygiene which you were talking about like you may not need to upload to. So you
And we've maybe we'll get to Python chapter two because this is you know all questions that do lead to it too of going back a little bit before like talking about these learning containers was the like project hygiene which you were talking about like you may not need to upload to. So you So you. Like get hub or something like that or you can so I get that there's dot ignore and dot e and v files that you put a lot of your codes into and you do the dot ignore so they don't upload
So you. Like get hub or something like that or you can so I get that there's dot ignore and dot e and v files that you put a lot of your codes into and you do the dot ignore so they don't upload So when you do with your dot e and v file like if you deleted off your computer because you uploaded it on get hub there's no way of really getting it back or uploads on get hub but it's not public
So when you do with your dot e and v file like if you deleted off your computer because you uploaded it on get hub there's no way of really getting it back or uploads on get hub but it's not public No no you do not upload your environment file to get up that that is that is the recipe for a bad day
No no you do not upload your environment file to get up that that is that is the recipe for a bad day If you delete your envy file you have deleted your envy file you need to recreate it and there are ways that you can put secrets in places that are there but you're not like with get hub get hub has a whole secrets space we're like I mean I can show you this
If you delete your envy file you have deleted your envy file you need to recreate it and there are ways that you can put secrets in places that are there but you're not like with get hub get hub has a whole secrets space we're like I mean I can show you this Wait what screen screen yeah no wrong screen other screen so many screens I get it so many screens yeah I'm just green. Yay all right so let's just do. You go up there thank you. Okay
Wait what screen screen yeah no wrong screen other screen so many screens I get it so many screens yeah I'm just green. Yay all right so let's just do. You go up there thank you. Okay Okay. I'm trying to go to one that I know I don't have secrets on actually let's just do this one because this is just my profile this is just my like my read me whatever super clean can you zoom in a little bit please
Okay. I'm trying to go to one that I know I don't have secrets on actually let's just do this one because this is just my profile this is just my like my read me whatever super clean can you zoom in a little bit please Absolutely better yes thank you awesome so if I if I wanted to have some secret here that I'm pulling from I would just go to settings I would go to whoa whoa oh security no no no do I don't have secrets enabled on this. Oh secrets and variables does snake would a bit me go fuck
Absolutely better yes thank you awesome so if I if I wanted to have some secret here that I'm pulling from I would just go to settings I would go to whoa whoa oh security no no no do I don't have secrets enabled on this. Oh secrets and variables does snake would a bit me go fuck There you go secrets and variables so let's say that like I want to spin this up in a code space and. I want to make sure that some secret environment variable is available in that code space so I want to say
There you go secrets and variables so let's say that like I want to spin this up in a code space and. I want to make sure that some secret environment variable is available in that code space so I want to say Jen's key whatever and I don't know why I started to spell supercalifragiles that's why would I do that to myself this is a secret like I can put that there and that's there now and that's where I would
Jen's key whatever and I don't know why I started to spell supercalifragiles that's why would I do that to myself this is a secret like I can put that there and that's there now and that's where I would So now when I open now when I open up a code space for this project this key is available and this might be a key that's in my environment file locally but now I don't need to upload my environment file because it's in this space and this space is is only here and as you can see you can't see it unless even if you're in here you can't see it now it is it is no longer visible to the world
So now when I open now when I open up a code space for this project this key is available and this might be a key that's in my environment file locally but now I don't need to upload my environment file because it's in this space and this space is is only here and as you can see you can't see it unless even if you're in here you can't see it now it is it is no longer visible to the world Nobody knows what this key is it is not usable and the way that you do that is you might use it for something like an action
Nobody knows what this key is it is not usable and the way that you do that is you might use it for something like an action I didn't realize I had all these keys in here okay so these are these are things that oh they haven't been used in several years and they haven't been updated in several years which. Now one one second
I didn't realize I had all these keys in here okay so these are these are things that oh they haven't been used in several years and they haven't been updated in several years which. Now one one second Now one one second. Yeah so yeah like having all these keys in here means that apparently when my website is this oh this is because my old website used to deploy from here so yeah like I have all these keys in here from when I used to deploy my website from this repo so like
Now one one second. Yeah so yeah like having all these keys in here means that apparently when my website is this oh this is because my old website used to deploy from here so yeah like I have all these keys in here from when I used to deploy my website from this repo so like You might start building a thing and then all of a sudden it's like oh hey I need that key what's that key for this okay here it is but there's no way as I'm deleting these now on stream there's no way for me to view what these keys are and honestly most of these websites don't exist anymore so it's not even like even if you saw them you're like
You might start building a thing and then all of a sudden it's like oh hey I need that key what's that key for this okay here it is but there's no way as I'm deleting these now on stream there's no way for me to view what these keys are and honestly most of these websites don't exist anymore so it's not even like even if you saw them you're like But yeah like image kit image kit was a way that I would auto size resize images on my website but I needed a key to do that so it was like okay hey run this code but here's my key and it's in here so that's how you that's how you move things like if you need to access them you you definitely don't put them because as I mentioned before I can
But yeah like image kit image kit was a way that I would auto size resize images on my website but I needed a key to do that so it was like okay hey run this code but here's my key and it's in here so that's how you that's how you move things like if you need to access them you you definitely don't put them because as I mentioned before I can I can like go here you can't see what this key is I can't see what this key is anymore once I add it it's there I can change it but I can't like actually view what it is they protect me from myself and my life streaming apparently you can also just do like regular variables too so like these are ones that you might want
I can like go here you can't see what this key is I can't see what this key is anymore once I add it it's there I can change it but I can't like actually view what it is they protect me from myself and my life streaming apparently you can also just do like regular variables too so like these are ones that you might want That are perfectly fine to see you have different environments those environments might have different variables and things like that but what you don't want is to have some file over here and there's probably more stuff in here than it should be in all honesty
That are perfectly fine to see you have different environments those environments might have different variables and things like that but what you don't want is to have some file over here and there's probably more stuff in here than it should be in all honesty Like not not to a dangerous level but you say hey here are all the things that I don't want to exist in my GitHub repo by no means are you to ever load any of this stuff and a lot of this is build stuff that just takes up clutter and we were talking about earlier with like Jupiter notebooks and like ipython configuration files and things like that
Like not not to a dangerous level but you say hey here are all the things that I don't want to exist in my GitHub repo by no means are you to ever load any of this stuff and a lot of this is build stuff that just takes up clutter and we were talking about earlier with like Jupiter notebooks and like ipython configuration files and things like that But we also see things like pit file lock files python version files celery schedule things like that and then you have this entire list of environment files that you don't want included
But we also see things like pit file lock files python version files celery schedule things like that and then you have this entire list of environment files that you don't want included And the way that I generate this is I I don't do this you know I don't do this like manually because that would be a nightmare what is this. Let's get rid of that let's just do something completely new. And then we'll do an open and we'll make just another test folder. Jim stream
And the way that I generate this is I I don't do this you know I don't do this like manually because that would be a nightmare what is this. Let's get rid of that let's just do something completely new. And then we'll do an open and we'll make just another test folder. Jim stream Jim stream. Get ignore IO I've got you I got you this is a different way to do this open up your terminal. And I know this is really small is there a way yeah make that bigger. Make it really really big. Thanks
Jim stream. Get ignore IO I've got you I got you this is a different way to do this open up your terminal. And I know this is really small is there a way yeah make that bigger. Make it really really big. Thanks Thanks. Now I've got to figure out I mean okay I can't make it that big doesn't like it when it's that big there we go there we go. And in here you just do mpx get ignore python. And then what that does is that just builds a get ignore file that I can then look at that has all of those things
Thanks. Now I've got to figure out I mean okay I can't make it that big doesn't like it when it's that big there we go there we go. And in here you just do mpx get ignore python. And then what that does is that just builds a get ignore file that I can then look at that has all of those things Yeah. Okay. Well now you Anthony and result because she's get hub are all going to get tagged on asking the interwebs what their best practices are for what you do with this content if you don't want to get it. And then what you do with this content if you don't want to keep it on your computer
Yeah. Okay. Well now you Anthony and result because she's get hub are all going to get tagged on asking the interwebs what their best practices are for what you do with this content if you don't want to get it. And then what you do with this content if you don't want to keep it on your computer But you need to have a backup somewhere I'm just curious what everybody has to say. But this actually like makes it very tangible yet at the same time I'm like I feel like so many different people may have. Yeah. Yeah
But you need to have a backup somewhere I'm just curious what everybody has to say. But this actually like makes it very tangible yet at the same time I'm like I feel like so many different people may have. Yeah. Yeah Yeah. Yeah. And then what I think is of this and like their own ways of doing things that is one thing I absolutely love about the interwebs. Is everyone does something different. Let's do some python stuff. Right. Right. Now that I've got this folder here let's do some python stuff
Yeah. Yeah. And then what I think is of this and like their own ways of doing things that is one thing I absolutely love about the interwebs. Is everyone does something different. Let's do some python stuff. Right. Right. Now that I've got this folder here let's do some python stuff And then the python stuff are is actually just probably fair basic questions. That's fine. So let me. I'm going to switch us and I'm going to go to mine and zoom this in one more of. So it's chapter two flow control
And then the python stuff are is actually just probably fair basic questions. That's fine. So let me. I'm going to switch us and I'm going to go to mine and zoom this in one more of. So it's chapter two flow control And then one of the first things that this chapter is talking about is bullion values and then comparison operators which. Pretty pretty, you know, self explanatory. I've seen this before didn't seem too confusing. Remembering that it has a name
And then one of the first things that this chapter is talking about is bullion values and then comparison operators which. Pretty pretty, you know, self explanatory. I've seen this before didn't seem too confusing. Remembering that it has a name Probably is going to take a little bit but you know that part is is helpful. The part that I was like first thing that. Would be helpful to talk about more is. You have the double equals and then you have the equals and one means equal to and one means the assignment
Probably is going to take a little bit but you know that part is is helpful. The part that I was like first thing that. Would be helpful to talk about more is. You have the double equals and then you have the equals and one means equal to and one means the assignment And I guess that seems kind of confusing to me because. Does the assignment of it mean that it's going to be like a string or a value instead of a. I'm working on how to put this into words. I'm comparing it to something in chapter two or chapter one. So like scroll the way down to do anything
And I guess that seems kind of confusing to me because. Does the assignment of it mean that it's going to be like a string or a value instead of a. I'm working on how to put this into words. I'm comparing it to something in chapter two or chapter one. So like scroll the way down to do anything Okay. There we go. So spam is a sign 40 is a sign to spam. But 40 is not equal to spam. So let's let's pull up a let's pull up something to write code in. Whether it's VS code or juper notebook or whatever. What's that? What was that yelling about? I thought it was made force quit. Okay
Okay. There we go. So spam is a sign 40 is a sign to spam. But 40 is not equal to spam. So let's let's pull up a let's pull up something to write code in. Whether it's VS code or juper notebook or whatever. What's that? What was that yelling about? I thought it was made force quit. Okay Okay. Which I can't say is wrong of it. I probably did something. I like to overload it. It gets mad. Mike might. Is this file still does not update to this day still doesn't. You know, it's just not going to happen. I know. Just you could either do a new file or we could do a new notebook
Okay. Which I can't say is wrong of it. I probably did something. I like to overload it. It gets mad. Mike might. Is this file still does not update to this day still doesn't. You know, it's just not going to happen. I know. Just you could either do a new file or we could do a new notebook Yeah, I would just prefer new notebook. I think it's not going to happen. I think it's going to happen. Which I think isn't there a way that you can do. I don't operate notebooks mostly. So. Yeah. Open up the command palette. And yeah, oh, you got it. There you go. Okay. We got something here
Yeah, I would just prefer new notebook. I think it's not going to happen. I think it's going to happen. Which I think isn't there a way that you can do. I don't operate notebooks mostly. So. Yeah. Open up the command palette. And yeah, oh, you got it. There you go. Okay. We got something here So let's let's try this. You want to say spam is equal to 42, right? That's what we were saying. Yeah. So let's let's assign spam to 42. Sorry. It's assigned 42 to spam. Okay. Okay. So now. If you do spam equal equal 42, you're going to get true. My keyboard is running go under my computer. Spam
So let's let's try this. You want to say spam is equal to 42, right? That's what we were saying. Yeah. So let's let's assign spam to 42. Sorry. It's assigned 42 to spam. Okay. Okay. So now. If you do spam equal equal 42, you're going to get true. My keyboard is running go under my computer. Spam Spam. Equal equal. 42. You should get true. Okay. So we want to run run that that block there. We got to get you updated on python a little bit. You're running three nine. We need to get you get you into three 11 land. But that's for another
Spam. Equal equal. 42. You should get true. Okay. So we want to run run that that block there. We got to get you updated on python a little bit. You're running three nine. We need to get you get you into three 11 land. But that's for another There's a whole conversation about python environments that. That's a whole hour. Yes. Yes. You can install the latest version of python the easiest way to do it is go to python.org and then just install it. But. There we go. You probably don't want to do that in the long term
There's a whole conversation about python environments that. That's a whole hour. Yes. Yes. You can install the latest version of python the easiest way to do it is go to python.org and then just install it. But. There we go. You probably don't want to do that in the long term If you're going to do python development. Over a long period of time. Fair enough. So it came back as true. Right. So why did it come back as true. Because. Because. Okay. To figure that out. I'm going to do this really great home. Okay. Because it is a. A variable. I don't know what literal means
If you're going to do python development. Over a long period of time. Fair enough. So it came back as true. Right. So why did it come back as true. Because. Because. Okay. To figure that out. I'm going to do this really great home. Okay. Because it is a. A variable. I don't know what literal means Literally literal just means that's what it is. Like occasionally if you're doing things like type hinting. What you might say is I have this value. This value should be. Any of these things. And it can be like a list of different values. To say literal just means. Spam literally is 42
Literally literal just means that's what it is. Like occasionally if you're doing things like type hinting. What you might say is I have this value. This value should be. Any of these things. And it can be like a list of different values. To say literal just means. Spam literally is 42 And you can say that it's 42. But spam cannot equal string 42. Because it's a string. Yeah. And if you try does does the string of 42 equal the the integer 42. So I'd have to do 42. Because I can't put those the other direction. Can I. You put a string equal and integer. And I mean
And you can say that it's 42. But spam cannot equal string 42. Because it's a string. Yeah. And if you try does does the string of 42 equal the the integer 42. So I'd have to do 42. Because I can't put those the other direction. Can I. You put a string equal and integer. And I mean And I mean. In most cases the answer will be no. Or sorry that most cases the answers will be false. But yeah, you can say. You know does a string equal equal this. You can say does anything equal equal anything. Yeah. So that's still false. Okay. This is. So if I were to do to do spam
And I mean. In most cases the answer will be no. Or sorry that most cases the answers will be false. But yeah, you can say. You know does a string equal equal this. You can say does anything equal equal anything. Yeah. So that's still false. Okay. This is. So if I were to do to do spam Equal equal 42. So spam equals 42. Would. I need to. Then. Will it also assign. 42 to spam. Like will it assign and equal it? Or will it be like. I then have to assign it to equal it. Or to use it again. If. If you try to change the value of spam to equal the string of 42
Equal equal 42. So spam equals 42. Would. I need to. Then. Will it also assign. 42 to spam. Like will it assign and equal it? Or will it be like. I then have to assign it to equal it. Or to use it again. If. If you try to change the value of spam to equal the string of 42 It will no longer equal the integer 42. So it can. A variable assignment can only be assigned to one thing. Now that one thing could be maybe a list of things. So you could you could say like. Let's do. So spam. I mean, you've already assigned it now. So once you've assigned it, it should still
It will no longer equal the integer 42. So it can. A variable assignment can only be assigned to one thing. Now that one thing could be maybe a list of things. So you could you could say like. Let's do. So spam. I mean, you've already assigned it now. So once you've assigned it, it should still Yeah, it'll still. Yeah. Because it's it's holding that value in memory. You would have to reassign it to something else or you'd have to like. Destroy this. Notebook and create a new one. Yeah. If you do it equals 45, it's going to say. It's going to say no. It doesn't equal 45. Yeah
Yeah, it'll still. Yeah. Because it's it's holding that value in memory. You would have to reassign it to something else or you'd have to like. Destroy this. Notebook and create a new one. Yeah. If you do it equals 45, it's going to say. It's going to say no. It doesn't equal 45. Yeah Yeah. What? It's going to be a list of things. So spam is held in memory. So the the the value that you've assigned is still assigned. It's not running. Everything again. And that's why what you can do. Like you can have a notebook that has multiple code blocks
Yeah. What? It's going to be a list of things. So spam is held in memory. So the the the value that you've assigned is still assigned. It's not running. Everything again. And that's why what you can do. Like you can have a notebook that has multiple code blocks And you say, all right, in code block one, I want you to assign this value to this. In code block two, I want you to get that value and do something else with it. It's still. That thing exists in memory. So until you. Remove. And so if you let me put that one down in memory of it. Then it will
And you say, all right, in code block one, I want you to assign this value to this. In code block two, I want you to get that value and do something else with it. It's still. That thing exists in memory. So until you. Remove. And so if you let me put that one down in memory of it. Then it will Then it will. Always be that thing. Like restart. Where did you go? We're on the in the block where it's. Yep. Can you make that a little bit bigger? I'm sorry. Like the window itself bigger. Oh, yeah. And I like the explanation we got. uh, literal. So just give me one second. Yeah
Then it will. Always be that thing. Like restart. Where did you go? We're on the in the block where it's. Yep. Can you make that a little bit bigger? I'm sorry. Like the window itself bigger. Oh, yeah. And I like the explanation we got. uh, literal. So just give me one second. Yeah Yeah. Hit show on screen. I would say it is, it is a literally. Uh, uh, okay. Interpret as literal data. What does the thing go? There was a thing that said, oh, hit the little three dots next to clear outputs of all sales, little three dots there. Uh, and hit restart. Yeah. Restart. Yeah. Okay
Yeah. Hit show on screen. I would say it is, it is a literally. Uh, uh, okay. Interpret as literal data. What does the thing go? There was a thing that said, oh, hit the little three dots next to clear outputs of all sales, little three dots there. Uh, and hit restart. Yeah. Restart. Yeah. Okay Yeah. Okay. So now, now hit run on that and what you'll get is, yeah, spam isn't defined. Oh, so it won't. Yeah. But if I do this, and, uh, do you run all? it tells me true. But then if I comment this out, it'll still be true. Comment. Come on. Come on. Well, you know what? That's still works
Yeah. Okay. So now, now hit run on that and what you'll get is, yeah, spam isn't defined. Oh, so it won't. Yeah. But if I do this, and, uh, do you run all? it tells me true. But then if I comment this out, it'll still be true. Comment. Come on. Come on. Well, you know what? That's still works Yeah, it's still true. Because once you've assigned it, you've assigned it, and it has that assignment in memory. So when you restarted the, the notebook server, you cleared the memory of it. So all of your assignments went away. What you're saying makes sense
Yeah, it's still true. Because once you've assigned it, you've assigned it, and it has that assignment in memory. So when you restarted the, the notebook server, you cleared the memory of it. So all of your assignments went away. What you're saying makes sense Now also thinking about it to, JavaScript is JavaScript doesn't do that. And so this just got cooler and also more confusing, but cooler. I mean, it's, that's just a trick of notebooks. Like if, if you were to do this inside of like a, just a regular Python script, it would not work
Now also thinking about it to, JavaScript is JavaScript doesn't do that. And so this just got cooler and also more confusing, but cooler. I mean, it's, that's just a trick of notebooks. Like if, if you were to do this inside of like a, just a regular Python script, it would not work It would just do the JavaScript. Oh, okay. So if I were in VS code, VS code, instead of in Jupyter, it would do the, it wouldn't remember. Right. Oh, it's a Jupyter. That's cool. And this makes more sense
It would just do the JavaScript. Oh, okay. So if I were in VS code, VS code, instead of in Jupyter, it would do the, it wouldn't remember. Right. Oh, it's a Jupyter. That's cool. And this makes more sense So the trick with that though is make sure that if you're doing a thing that you don't leave something in or think that you've removed it. And then like, it's still there. So like, it comes with its own like trade-offs there
So the trick with that though is make sure that if you're doing a thing that you don't leave something in or think that you've removed it. And then like, it's still there. So like, it comes with its own like trade-offs there Because I used to do that a lot with, when I would do data stuff, I would like imports CSV files and then store the value of the CSV file in a variable. And then like, I would go to do something else. And I would have a reference to that CSV file still
Because I used to do that a lot with, when I would do data stuff, I would like imports CSV files and then store the value of the CSV file in a variable. And then like, I would go to do something else. And I would have a reference to that CSV file still And then all of a sudden, now it's pulling up this data. And I'm like, where's all this coming from? And it's because I did everything inside of a notebook and didn't get rid of the stuff. But yeah
And then all of a sudden, now it's pulling up this data. And I'm like, where's all this coming from? And it's because I did everything inside of a notebook and didn't get rid of the stuff. But yeah But yeah. So does does that kind of answer the question on like, this thing, this thing equals this other thing? Yes. It does answer that question. I don't know if we'll need to go back there for this next question, but let's find out
But yeah. So does does that kind of answer the question on like, this thing, this thing equals this other thing? Yes. It does answer that question. I don't know if we'll need to go back there for this next question, but let's find out And oh, the scrolling to the next part is the Operators Truth Table. And just talking that through a little bit like, like, expressions would it evaluate to? And I'm like, would it have false and false be true? Okay. Everything on here until the final one makes sense. Yeah
And oh, the scrolling to the next part is the Operators Truth Table. And just talking that through a little bit like, like, expressions would it evaluate to? And I'm like, would it have false and false be true? Okay. Everything on here until the final one makes sense. Yeah Yeah. So there is a, there's this python thing that I'm sure you will learn about eventually called any and all. And that's how I like to explain this. Let me see. Go to VS Code again. VS Code. There we go. All right. Let's just create another block. Like, this is easier. New code. Yeah
Yeah. So there is a, there's this python thing that I'm sure you will learn about eventually called any and all. And that's how I like to explain this. Let me see. Go to VS Code again. VS Code. There we go. All right. Let's just create another block. Like, this is easier. New code. Yeah New code. Yeah. There you go. All right. So let's make a list called options. So options equals and then a Python list. Oh, sorry. The list is the bracket thingies
New code. Yeah. There you go. All right. So let's make a list called options. So options equals and then a Python list. Oh, sorry. The list is the bracket thingies Uh, I mean, we can, we can use that, but or that, yeah, that's what I was referring to, but we could also do the other thing and there are times when you want to do that instead of that, but don't worry about that. Okay. So let's put true and false in as option. So true comma false
Uh, I mean, we can, we can use that, but or that, yeah, that's what I was referring to, but we could also do the other thing and there are times when you want to do that instead of that, but don't worry about that. Okay. So let's put true and false in as option. So true comma false Sorry, true comma. I keep forgetting that words, words have meaning in programming. Okay. So what is the value of true is it's true, right? Oh, yes. The value of false is false, right? Yeah. The value of false is false. False equals. Yes. True equals true. Okay. Okay
Sorry, true comma. I keep forgetting that words, words have meaning in programming. Okay. So what is the value of true is it's true, right? Oh, yes. The value of false is false, right? Yeah. The value of false is false. False equals. Yes. True equals true. Okay. Okay Okay. Okay. So there's this concept called any and all. Next line, let's do any, let's do print an inside of the. Is it like that or just print in parentheses yet like that. And there's no space in between them. There can be, but they're typically isn't there you go. So now we're going to do any
Okay. Okay. So there's this concept called any and all. Next line, let's do any, let's do print an inside of the. Is it like that or just print in parentheses yet like that. And there's no space in between them. There can be, but they're typically isn't there you go. So now we're going to do any And I'm sorry, any in parentheses. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm like, why am I forgetting words? Okay. Any. You know, you're going to want to put parentheses, another set of parentheses there. Okay. Because any is is a is a method. Nope. On the end of any. See this. I'm going to get there. Right there
And I'm sorry, any in parentheses. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm like, why am I forgetting words? Okay. Any. You know, you're going to want to put parentheses, another set of parentheses there. Okay. Because any is is a is a method. Nope. On the end of any. See this. I'm going to get there. Right there Right there. Like this. Perfect. And then. Yeah. Yeah. Options inside of that one. Perfect. All right. So. The. Any says. Inside of this list of things. Is there one any one of them that equals true. Okay. So what do you think the answer is going to be when you run this? That. Options
Right there. Like this. Perfect. And then. Yeah. Yeah. Options inside of that one. Perfect. All right. So. The. Any says. Inside of this list of things. Is there one any one of them that equals true. Okay. So what do you think the answer is going to be when you run this? That. Options Options. Any that that will based on what we just looked at it be true true is true true false or false true is false. Because false is false. That's why false and false is still false yet. I almost seem like it's like a double double negative. But in it make it positive
Options. Any that that will based on what we just looked at it be true true is true true false or false true is false. Because false is false. That's why false and false is still false yet. I almost seem like it's like a double double negative. But in it make it positive That's why I prefer using any and all because any and all make more sense in my brain than and or. So yeah, like I said, looking at options, we have one that equals true and one that equals false. And we're in any says is there any one of these that equals true
That's why I prefer using any and all because any and all make more sense in my brain than and or. So yeah, like I said, looking at options, we have one that equals true and one that equals false. And we're in any says is there any one of these that equals true So looking at what you have in your options would do you think that this would print true or false? If it's just looking for one that's true true. Let's run it. Wait. No, let's run it. Let's just run it and find out. Because true true and true would be true
So looking at what you have in your options would do you think that this would print true or false? If it's just looking for one that's true true. Let's run it. Wait. No, let's run it. Let's just run it and find out. Because true true and true would be true No, because any because or in this case means any. It doesn't matter how many are true or how many are false if there is one that is true then the answer will be true. And by the way, any any and all are just ways of saying and or but you can do it with more characters
No, because any because or in this case means any. It doesn't matter how many are true or how many are false if there is one that is true then the answer will be true. And by the way, any any and all are just ways of saying and or but you can do it with more characters You can say like you can have like a hundred of these options and then you would like true true true true true true true false false false false true false true. And if you do any then if one of them is true then the answer is true
You can say like you can have like a hundred of these options and then you would like true true true true true true true false false false false true false true. And if you do any then if one of them is true then the answer is true If one of them is false, it doesn't matter because if one of them was still true, the answer was true. And then if you do all then it says everything has to be true. I'm taking notes. Okay. Okay. So any means let anything basically anything. And then I look at any as any one
If one of them is false, it doesn't matter because if one of them was still true, the answer was true. And then if you do all then it says everything has to be true. I'm taking notes. Okay. Okay. So any means let anything basically anything. And then I look at any as any one If anyone is true, then I'm going to return true. And then all would be every one. Like anyone and everyone. Like the key says it don't let not the over thinking but it's saying is any of them true. So let's let's do the same thing where we do
If anyone is true, then I'm going to return true. And then all would be every one. Like anyone and everyone. Like the key says it don't let not the over thinking but it's saying is any of them true. So let's let's do the same thing where we do In options change true true or true false to false false. Okay. So now do you think it's going to return true false true. And what I think is going to be true is out at least one of them are false. No, because any remember any is looking for at least one to be true
In options change true true or true false to false false. Okay. So now do you think it's going to return true false true. And what I think is going to be true is out at least one of them are false. No, because any remember any is looking for at least one to be true And since it's not using the word true, therefore it's not true. So. Exactly. It's false. Okay. Yeah. I mean, we can run this and see like you're your your. And then you can see what it is. So I think it's just like. Saying true, there will be a false there. That is truthful. Yeah
And since it's not using the word true, therefore it's not true. So. Exactly. It's false. Okay. Yeah. I mean, we can run this and see like you're your your. And then you can see what it is. So I think it's just like. Saying true, there will be a false there. That is truthful. Yeah Yeah. As in like language. Add a true. Add a true to this option. So like you have false false true. All right. Is that going to equal true or false. So that's going to be true. So that's going to be true. Because there's at least a true. Now. Because it's right. It's right. Yeah. You're right
Yeah. As in like language. Add a true. Add a true to this option. So like you have false false true. All right. Is that going to equal true or false. So that's going to be true. So that's going to be true. Because there's at least a true. Now. Because it's right. It's right. Yeah. You're right Yeah. You're right. Because it's looking for any one from. If you think about it from anyone and everyone, like if any one of you are true, then I'm going to return true. So now let's change any to all. And that's still make sense. It's. It's just the idea of getting around the the verbiage. Yeah
Yeah. You're right. Because it's looking for any one from. If you think about it from anyone and everyone, like if any one of you are true, then I'm going to return true. So now let's change any to all. And that's still make sense. It's. It's just the idea of getting around the the verbiage. Yeah Yeah. Like let's say it. I don't know what like. That's why I don't like. There are false. There. It is truthful that there are there is a false. So you can write that out. And that's not how. But that's not what it's asking. Yes. You said. Are. All of these false
Yeah. Like let's say it. I don't know what like. That's why I don't like. There are false. There. It is truthful that there are there is a false. So you can write that out. And that's not how. But that's not what it's asking. Yes. You said. Are. All of these false All of these false. And you only have false and false, then you would get true. But there that's kind of a lot to check for. And in many cases, we, we don't. Do that. Yeah. That's like these are like Python, anti patterns in many ways. Like what we're what you're checking for is often
All of these false. And you only have false and false, then you would get true. But there that's kind of a lot to check for. And in many cases, we, we don't. Do that. Yeah. That's like these are like Python, anti patterns in many ways. Like what we're what you're checking for is often And this is where like I don't want to pick on out because I like out. I was a friend of mine. But to say true or true. You're probably not going to ever do that. You're not going to do true or false. You're not going to do false or true. You're not going to do false or false
And this is where like I don't want to pick on out because I like out. I was a friend of mine. But to say true or true. You're probably not going to ever do that. You're not going to do true or false. You're not going to do false or true. You're not going to do false or false You're going to say I have some things. And what I want to know is. Are these things true? Are these situations happening? Or are these things going and doing something that I don't expect? Because what what you're not going to do is have false true true
You're going to say I have some things. And what I want to know is. Are these things true? Are these situations happening? Or are these things going and doing something that I don't expect? Because what what you're not going to do is have false true true And said you're going to have a bunch of computer logic that says. What does this computer logic do? Or what does this computer logic equate to? And example of like you might have a data class, which I mean I'm going to
And said you're going to have a bunch of computer logic that says. What does this computer logic do? Or what does this computer logic equate to? And example of like you might have a data class, which I mean I'm going to Don't worry about what a data class is, but you might have a data class, which is just an object in that person or that object is called person. And our person we're going to we're going to assign called Jin. And we say, OK, Jin has accessories eyes nose mouth hair
Don't worry about what a data class is, but you might have a data class, which is just an object in that person or that object is called person. And our person we're going to we're going to assign called Jin. And we say, OK, Jin has accessories eyes nose mouth hair And these things can equal different things. Maybe eyes nose and mouth are just. Do they exist? Do they exist on Jin's face? The answer is yes. So then you might have OK, what about accessories glasses might be an accessory
And these things can equal different things. Maybe eyes nose and mouth are just. Do they exist? Do they exist on Jin's face? The answer is yes. So then you might have OK, what about accessories glasses might be an accessory So now if we want to compare does Jin have eyes nose a mouth and glasses? All of these things could be true. But then we also might have hair and hair might be hair color or we might call it hair color
So now if we want to compare does Jin have eyes nose a mouth and glasses? All of these things could be true. But then we also might have hair and hair might be hair color or we might call it hair color And we say, OK, maybe we want maybe we're building a design app that says like, hey, given a picture, we're going to give you an outfit that matches your style. So when you look at
And we say, OK, maybe we want maybe we're building a design app that says like, hey, given a picture, we're going to give you an outfit that matches your style. So when you look at Does this person have eyes nose and mouth? If not, then we're not looking at a human being so that our app doesn't work. Or we're not looking at their face at least. So maybe that's that's something there
Does this person have eyes nose and mouth? If not, then we're not looking at a human being so that our app doesn't work. Or we're not looking at their face at least. So maybe that's that's something there But then you say, OK, what is the hair color? And you might have one shirt that is neon green. And you're like, OK, we're going to match this with hairstyles that are blue hairstyles that are blonde. But we're not going to match it with hair that's just black or hair that's purple
But then you say, OK, what is the hair color? And you might have one shirt that is neon green. And you're like, OK, we're going to match this with hairstyles that are blue hairstyles that are blonde. But we're not going to match it with hair that's just black or hair that's purple So then we might say instead of just true or false, we'll say eyes nose mouth. Hair color is the hair color blue or blonde? If yes, sure. If your hair color being purple, we're going to go true, true, true, false. The hair is purple. It's not blue or blonde
So then we might say instead of just true or false, we'll say eyes nose mouth. Hair color is the hair color blue or blonde? If yes, sure. If your hair color being purple, we're going to go true, true, true, false. The hair is purple. It's not blue or blonde Therefore, we're not going to provide this option. So this is this is why when when we talk about the idea of like what is true and what is false. I hate it when we boil it down to simply is it sure is it false? Because nobody is going to do that in code
Therefore, we're not going to provide this option. So this is this is why when when we talk about the idea of like what is true and what is false. I hate it when we boil it down to simply is it sure is it false? Because nobody is going to do that in code No one's going to be like, I have this true thing here. I have this false thing here. It's like, I have some code that ultimately results in something being true or false. So that you're you're going into questions that I had, but I'm going to skip ahead to go possibly we may go back
No one's going to be like, I have this true thing here. I have this false thing here. It's like, I have some code that ultimately results in something being true or false. So that you're you're going into questions that I had, but I'm going to skip ahead to go possibly we may go back Let me find this graphic. I should also mention I am not a teacher like Laura is I am a person who gets angry at the internet and builds things. I feel like that is fair. That is my just teaching language is like, ah, this makes me angry. I'm going to talk about it. Okay
Let me find this graphic. I should also mention I am not a teacher like Laura is I am a person who gets angry at the internet and builds things. I feel like that is fair. That is my just teaching language is like, ah, this makes me angry. I'm going to talk about it. Okay Okay. So later on in this chapter, we go through E-LIF statements, which do make sense to me. And like your examples were totally making sense based on knowing like this part is coming. I think what I was a little stuck on is could you have an E-LIF statement. And then another E-LIF statement
Okay. So later on in this chapter, we go through E-LIF statements, which do make sense to me. And like your examples were totally making sense based on knowing like this part is coming. I think what I was a little stuck on is could you have an E-LIF statement. And then another E-LIF statement Mm hmm. Like kind of how you were just explaining like, okay, is. So, do they have a name or do they have I know and a mouth. Yes. Do they have XYZ. Do they have purple hair. Yes, no, like, okay, so this like. Matthew will go with. Can flow chart can expand more than just these basic true false
Mm hmm. Like kind of how you were just explaining like, okay, is. So, do they have a name or do they have I know and a mouth. Yes. Do they have XYZ. Do they have purple hair. Yes, no, like, okay, so this like. Matthew will go with. Can flow chart can expand more than just these basic true false Okay. Yeah. Great. Let's, I mean, let's build it like we can, we can build this out. Really quick. We got a, yeah, it's better to give examples
Okay. Yeah. Great. Let's, I mean, let's build it like we can, we can build this out. Really quick. We got a, yeah, it's better to give examples They get the temptation to introduce a Boolean logic from a teacher point of view because it's the knowledge sort of distilled and abstracted, but learning is so much easier from examples. Agreed. 100%. Yeah. Let's build it. Okay. I'm all, I'm all about the building of it
They get the temptation to introduce a Boolean logic from a teacher point of view because it's the knowledge sort of distilled and abstracted, but learning is so much easier from examples. Agreed. 100%. Yeah. Let's build it. Okay. I'm all, I'm all about the building of it And before we go there because I do want to build it, I just want to go over the stuff really quick that I skipped over to make sure just to make sure they don't go into these things. We'll build all of that too. Let's see. Okay. Okay
And before we go there because I do want to build it, I just want to go over the stuff really quick that I skipped over to make sure just to make sure they don't go into these things. We'll build all of that too. Let's see. Okay. Okay Okay. Okay. These, honestly, this actually made a lot of sense of mixing Boolean and comparison operators. I was like, this part makes sense. Not the true false had that one took a lot to get my head through, but this one, I'm like, oh, yeah, this totally makes sense
Okay. Okay. These, honestly, this actually made a lot of sense of mixing Boolean and comparison operators. I was like, this part makes sense. Not the true false had that one took a lot to get my head through, but this one, I'm like, oh, yeah, this totally makes sense I think it's also because Laura had to go through this graphic in the last chapter to help me write down the graphic because they didn't have colors. And I'm like, what are they doing? Yeah. And then we got into that entire conversation about order of operations
I think it's also because Laura had to go through this graphic in the last chapter to help me write down the graphic because they didn't have colors. And I'm like, what are they doing? Yeah. And then we got into that entire conversation about order of operations I always say, I don't, I don't read. I just try things and see what works. And that is how I learned a lot of this. But since doing this, it's a lot easier to like read through this beforehand and then ask specific questions when they don't click
I always say, I don't, I don't read. I just try things and see what works. And that is how I learned a lot of this. But since doing this, it's a lot easier to like read through this beforehand and then ask specific questions when they don't click I know that not everyone may have the opportunity to. So if y'all ever need the opportunity to join our streams, ask all the questions. Learn with us. Condition versus expression. Sorry. Yeah, you're good. We have, we have things happening. In the real world. Yeah, you got to go. You got to go
I know that not everyone may have the opportunity to. So if y'all ever need the opportunity to join our streams, ask all the questions. Learn with us. Condition versus expression. Sorry. Yeah, you're good. We have, we have things happening. In the real world. Yeah, you got to go. You got to go You got to go. No, no, no, no, we're good. We're good. And so speaking of Python, the. I always call it the gathering of the juggles, because that's where my brain is. Are you familiar? Are you familiar with what that is? No. That's okay. Don't worry about it. Okay
You got to go. No, no, no, no, we're good. We're good. And so speaking of Python, the. I always call it the gathering of the juggles, because that's where my brain is. Are you familiar? Are you familiar with what that is? No. That's okay. Don't worry about it. Okay Okay. I'm going to go to the collection of a bunch of nerds. Hey, James, what's going on? James. Thank you for the great and welcome, everyone. We are. You just walked in as I compared Python, US to the gathering of the juggles, which is
Okay. I'm going to go to the collection of a bunch of nerds. Hey, James, what's going on? James. Thank you for the great and welcome, everyone. We are. You just walked in as I compared Python, US to the gathering of the juggles, which is Some people are going to get that and some people are going to be like, that's wild. Python. We are going through this book. Automate the important stuff. Chapter two. We'll get there. We're going through. We're also learning. This, this slow roll of getting explanations behind everything. So
Some people are going to get that and some people are going to be like, that's wild. Python. We are going through this book. Automate the important stuff. Chapter two. We'll get there. We're going through. We're also learning. This, this slow roll of getting explanations behind everything. So So. And thank you, Jake, for joining. And what a see bid to. And yes, it is a great book. Here. This is. This is the sequel. This is. Let me, let me make it bigger again. Yeah. Yeah. Beyond the basic stuff. I call it. Automating the boring stuff to electric boot glue
So. And thank you, Jake, for joining. And what a see bid to. And yes, it is a great book. Here. This is. This is the sequel. This is. Let me, let me make it bigger again. Yeah. Yeah. Beyond the basic stuff. I call it. Automating the boring stuff to electric boot glue But yeah, Python, US is the largest gathering of Python developers on the planet. Normally. And people come from all over the world to hang out and do stuff. And I'll be there. So if you see the, I'm trying to hold the book and clap. It was hard. Like this. That's it. We were talking about it
But yeah, Python, US is the largest gathering of Python developers on the planet. Normally. And people come from all over the world to hang out and do stuff. And I'll be there. So if you see the, I'm trying to hold the book and clap. It was hard. Like this. That's it. We were talking about it So now we're. Now we're always doing things. Yay. Awesome. And thank you, see you, bid too. Yes. I started coding. Seven months ago, six months ago. And Jay has been a big part of that journey. And I'm learning Python and. Type script at the same time. I just get distracted
So now we're. Now we're always doing things. Yay. Awesome. And thank you, see you, bid too. Yes. I started coding. Seven months ago, six months ago. And Jay has been a big part of that journey. And I'm learning Python and. Type script at the same time. I just get distracted And then yell at the chat and be like, that's not what it is. Yes. Yes. So we were, we were about to go through what conditions versus expressions are. And I was scrolling down because. And I just I guess it's like a, a condition that, a condition that is an expression that. Evaluates true
And then yell at the chat and be like, that's not what it is. Yes. Yes. So we were, we were about to go through what conditions versus expressions are. And I was scrolling down because. And I just I guess it's like a, a condition that, a condition that is an expression that. Evaluates true Evaluates true. True or false. And I was like, did that just answer the question I had on the previous page? Possibly. Let's, let's see it again though, because I can't see it. Oh, hey, yeah, that would help. If I, um, share my screen. That would, that would help. Okay. So
Evaluates true. True or false. And I was like, did that just answer the question I had on the previous page? Possibly. Let's, let's see it again though, because I can't see it. Oh, hey, yeah, that would help. If I, um, share my screen. That would, that would help. Okay. So Okay. So. The question came up from. from under let me scroll back a little bit. And y'all, I have the paper book with me, as I showed video on the video, but we're going through it on the website as well because that makes it more accessible, which is amazing
Okay. So. The question came up from. from under let me scroll back a little bit. And y'all, I have the paper book with me, as I showed video on the video, but we're going through it on the website as well because that makes it more accessible, which is amazing Where am I going? Oh, you're questioning God answered right there. Wait, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, a little bit more, a little bit more right there
Where am I going? Oh, you're questioning God answered right there. Wait, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, a little bit more, a little bit more right there So you're asking, could you nest if LF statements inside of each other? So like, if I have an F statement, then I do some more F statements. And then if I have a F statement, can I do an LF statement and then do some more LF for F statements? Yeah. Interesting
So you're asking, could you nest if LF statements inside of each other? So like, if I have an F statement, then I do some more F statements. And then if I have a F statement, can I do an LF statement and then do some more LF for F statements? Yeah. Interesting Interesting. And I appreciate you saying this because I think, at least for myself, it doesn't always register that that might have answered the question because we went from flow chart to code. And I was going with flow chart in my mind, so that is crazy
Interesting. And I appreciate you saying this because I think, at least for myself, it doesn't always register that that might have answered the question because we went from flow chart to code. And I was going with flow chart in my mind, so that is crazy I still say we just build it out and see what it's doing. I'm down for that
I still say we just build it out and see what it's doing. I'm down for that I'm down for that. But basically, what's the difference between a condition and an expression? I don't know where it went on here, but it says that bullion expressions you've seen so far could all be considered conditions, which are the same thing as expressions
I'm down for that. But basically, what's the difference between a condition and an expression? I don't know where it went on here, but it says that bullion expressions you've seen so far could all be considered conditions, which are the same thing as expressions Condition is more specific name in the context of flow control statements. I'm like, what? I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. Just hearing that, what I'm guessing is, okay, I found it. Let me try to find it so everybody else can know what I'm trying to say
Condition is more specific name in the context of flow control statements. I'm like, what? I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. Just hearing that, what I'm guessing is, okay, I found it. Let me try to find it so everybody else can know what I'm trying to say It's elements of flow control conditions. Yeah, there you go. It's right here. There we go. Conditions always evaluate down to a bullion value. Okay, so that's the bullion expressions that we've looked at are true equals, true is true, true is false, false is false, all those things
It's elements of flow control conditions. Yeah, there you go. It's right here. There we go. Conditions always evaluate down to a bullion value. Okay, so that's the bullion expressions that we've looked at are true equals, true is true, true is false, false is false, all those things What we're doing conditions is we're questioning the truthiness of a thing. So a condition is like in our earlier question around spam, the spam equal 42. Well, we told spam that it does equal 42
What we're doing conditions is we're questioning the truthiness of a thing. So a condition is like in our earlier question around spam, the spam equal 42. Well, we told spam that it does equal 42 So the condition is if we were to do a whole bunch of things and we just wanted to check is all of this stuff greater than or less than 42. That's the condition. And then what it does is it'll boil down to no matter what we write, it'll boil down to whether or not it's true or false
So the condition is if we were to do a whole bunch of things and we just wanted to check is all of this stuff greater than or less than 42. That's the condition. And then what it does is it'll boil down to no matter what we write, it'll boil down to whether or not it's true or false And when we do an if statement, that's all it's checking for. It doesn't care what the code itself is. All it cares about is does the thing that we're telling it does it boil down to true or false? Okay. Mm-hmm
And when we do an if statement, that's all it's checking for. It doesn't care what the code itself is. All it cares about is does the thing that we're telling it does it boil down to true or false? Okay. Mm-hmm Mm-hmm. Can we build it now? I'm 90% sure that there are no more further questions before we got to that point. Okay. I think that was like the last of the questions before. I skipped ahead to the elifts, the elifts on the elifts
Mm-hmm. Can we build it now? I'm 90% sure that there are no more further questions before we got to that point. Okay. I think that was like the last of the questions before. I skipped ahead to the elifts, the elifts on the elifts The elifts, can your eat, well, I don't know if your elifts can have elifts, but your elifts can have if elifts, which are like a whole thing. But let's build some stuff out. Let's have some fun with it. All right
The elifts, can your eat, well, I don't know if your elifts can have elifts, but your elifts can have if elifts, which are like a whole thing. But let's build some stuff out. Let's have some fun with it. All right All right. Let's create a high, okay, we're going to do some higher level Python stuff just to make it easier for us to talk about this a little bit more. Let's create a class. We're just on typing class. We're going to call that class person. Oh, you said that it doesn't have a class space person
All right. Let's create a high, okay, we're going to do some higher level Python stuff just to make it easier for us to talk about this a little bit more. Let's create a class. We're just on typing class. We're going to call that class person. Oh, you said that it doesn't have a class space person No, just class space person. Just for the sake of your writing Python code, let's make that person and with a capital P. You don't necessarily have to, but that is convention. And then instead of a comma, we're going to do a colon. Okay. Now we're going to do a new line. And let's tab over again
No, just class space person. Just for the sake of your writing Python code, let's make that person and with a capital P. You don't necessarily have to, but that is convention. And then instead of a comma, we're going to do a colon. Okay. Now we're going to do a new line. And let's tab over again I don't know why it only tapped over to that's kind of weird. But that's fun. All right. So we're going to say eyes equal to. Well, eyes, eyes equal to. I mean, for some people they know that's fine. And then we're going to do nose equals one. And we're going to say, let's just do
I don't know why it only tapped over to that's kind of weird. But that's fun. All right. So we're going to say eyes equal to. Well, eyes, eyes equal to. I mean, for some people they know that's fine. And then we're going to do nose equals one. And we're going to say, let's just do Yeah, mouth equals one. And then. Years equals to. Okay. So now we're going to go a couple lines down. Let's do it. Yeah. Now let's make gin. Gin is equal to person. Well, gin equal person. Yeah. Wait, am I signing? Yeah, that's, that was my fault. Because what, what I said was gin is equal to
Yeah, mouth equals one. And then. Years equals to. Okay. So now we're going to go a couple lines down. Let's do it. Yeah. Now let's make gin. Gin is equal to person. Well, gin equal person. Yeah. Wait, am I signing? Yeah, that's, that was my fault. Because what, what I said was gin is equal to And that would be double equals. But we would say gin equals person. So I mean, that was the only reason. I mean, I'm not going to say it's all of these. It's equals one million. Yes. I mean. So okay, actually yes. Let's go back up there and let's add hairs
And that would be double equals. But we would say gin equals person. So I mean, that was the only reason. I mean, I'm not going to say it's all of these. It's equals one million. Yes. I mean. So okay, actually yes. Let's go back up there and let's add hairs And you can just throw a random number in there. Horace. horribly dyslexic and I like that you even said it and I was like, what are you talking? Okay, so we're going to create an instance of person. So you're going to add, add just open and closing parentheses there
And you can just throw a random number in there. Horace. horribly dyslexic and I like that you even said it and I was like, what are you talking? Okay, so we're going to create an instance of person. So you're going to add, add just open and closing parentheses there Now this isn't what you would do with a normal class. This isn't the way you would do a normal class, but this solves a purpose. This does what we're trying to do. All right, so now we're going to create an if statement on a few lines below, few lines below. And we're going to say, if, if gen
Now this isn't what you would do with a normal class. This isn't the way you would do a normal class, but this solves a purpose. This does what we're trying to do. All right, so now we're going to create an if statement on a few lines below, few lines below. And we're going to say, if, if genis is equal to two is equal to two is equal. So when I say is equal, that's like the equal equal. Okay. Yeah. Add a colon. And then on the next line, let's tab over again. Can you change your tab settings somewhere? Because that's going to bother me
is is equal to two is equal to two is equal. So when I say is equal, that's like the equal equal. Okay. Yeah. Add a colon. And then on the next line, let's tab over again. Can you change your tab settings somewhere? Because that's going to bother me I would think that it's probably using critter, but it shouldn't be. Go down to the little bracket in the bottom right corner, the brackets in the bottom right corner. Is that it? Okay, nevermind. Don't worry about it. I'll just deal with it. All right. So if gen
I would think that it's probably using critter, but it shouldn't be. Go down to the little bracket in the bottom right corner, the brackets in the bottom right corner. Is that it? Okay, nevermind. Don't worry about it. I'll just deal with it. All right. So if gen So if gen.is is equal to two, then we're going to do print. The print has the print this season. There we go. And then in quotations. Because we got to make a string. That's fine. Gen has two eyes glasses are an option. Okay. So let's just run this just to make sure that everything's working
So if gen.is is equal to two, then we're going to do print. The print has the print this season. There we go. And then in quotations. Because we got to make a string. That's fine. Gen has two eyes glasses are an option. Okay. So let's just run this just to make sure that everything's working And what we should see because you have two eyes. Oh, yeah. I have ads on my stream. If it gets too annoying, let me know. I put them there because they actually do start to make a little bit of money. But you know, I'm not a full time tons of subscribers yet
And what we should see because you have two eyes. Oh, yeah. I have ads on my stream. If it gets too annoying, let me know. I put them there because they actually do start to make a little bit of money. But you know, I'm not a full time tons of subscribers yet So I just been gauging on the audience how annoying they get. Jay tells me he's like, I think one time he told me on it. It makes me subscribe using Twitch Prime. I'm not going to lie. So like, I'm like, I haven't given my prime sub yet. So congratulations. Here's five. There we go
So I just been gauging on the audience how annoying they get. Jay tells me he's like, I think one time he told me on it. It makes me subscribe using Twitch Prime. I'm not going to lie. So like, I'm like, I haven't given my prime sub yet. So congratulations. Here's five. There we go There we go. So you don't have to be of them. Exactly. All right. So yeah. So we got it to read. It checked. It said, Gen has two eyes glasses are an option
There we go. So you don't have to be of them. Exactly. All right. So yeah. So we got it to read. It checked. It said, Gen has two eyes glasses are an option So now what we want to do is we want to say, what if Jen didn't have two eyes? What what happens next? And this is this is why I was saying that we normally wouldn't define it like this
So now what we want to do is we want to say, what if Jen didn't have two eyes? What what happens next? And this is this is why I was saying that we normally wouldn't define it like this But instead, you wouldn't want to do multiple if statements because you only want to access this if the first thing isn't true. So this is where that LF comes in. So we could do if else, if else, maybe we go, um, or we do LF, you can do LF, yeah. And I'm looking at this too. You throw a colon
But instead, you wouldn't want to do multiple if statements because you only want to access this if the first thing isn't true. So this is where that LF comes in. So we could do if else, if else, maybe we go, um, or we do LF, you can do LF, yeah. And I'm looking at this too. You throw a colon You throw a colon. Give it a colon. I'll let you. Sorry. You wouldn't give it a colon. You would you would add your logic and then give it a colon. So Oh, LF is not equal. Wait, is that is not equal? You would still need to I you need to define what you're comparing now
You throw a colon. Give it a colon. I'll let you. Sorry. You wouldn't give it a colon. You would you would add your logic and then give it a colon. So Oh, LF is not equal. Wait, is that is not equal? You would still need to I you need to define what you're comparing now LF doesn't understand that we're we're probably thinking about Jen's eyes because we may not be. So if Jen's eyes equal, well, you could say, yeah, if it doesn't equal to that's an option. I mean, yeah, you could do that
LF doesn't understand that we're we're probably thinking about Jen's eyes because we may not be. So if Jen's eyes equal, well, you could say, yeah, if it doesn't equal to that's an option. I mean, yeah, you could do that I was going to just say LF, if Jen's eyes equal one, we say Jen only has one eye. Maybe we get a monocle or an eye patch. Um, those are options as well. I mean, sure. Um, again, hey, someone might have lost an eye in the war
I was going to just say LF, if Jen's eyes equal one, we say Jen only has one eye. Maybe we get a monocle or an eye patch. Um, those are options as well. I mean, sure. Um, again, hey, someone might have lost an eye in the war So like it's we'll have been double checked since we're talking about Jen. I'm going to go with myself. Um, but if I were, but if I do what I put input here. So this is where I would I was going to say you're because we're doing a class thing. Maybe let's just reassign Jen's eye count
So like it's we'll have been double checked since we're talking about Jen. I'm going to go with myself. Um, but if I were, but if I do what I put input here. So this is where I would I was going to say you're because we're doing a class thing. Maybe let's just reassign Jen's eye count So we just say Jen. Eyes equals three because Jen secretly nope, not there, not there. That's our comparator. Um, just underneath Jen, Jen is equal to person. Just create a new line. And do Jen. Eyes equals just a different a different number. Yeah, there we go
So we just say Jen. Eyes equals three because Jen secretly nope, not there, not there. That's our comparator. Um, just underneath Jen, Jen is equal to person. Just create a new line. And do Jen. Eyes equals just a different a different number. Yeah, there we go Yeah, there we go. So now we've changed your eye count to three. And again, don't worry about the class of it all. That's just it just makes it easy for us to change these values quickly. Um, there is a correct or I guess more Pythonic way to do it, which I hate that phrase
Yeah, there we go. So now we've changed your eye count to three. And again, don't worry about the class of it all. That's just it just makes it easy for us to change these values quickly. Um, there is a correct or I guess more Pythonic way to do it, which I hate that phrase So I I bombeted a little as I said it, but it's okay. So let's run this. And what we should get is are you sure? Yeah. Because it did not equal to, but if I change this to two. Mm hmm. Then it'll say, yeah. Okay. New question for you. Mm hmm. Especially going back
So I I bombeted a little as I said it, but it's okay. So let's run this. And what we should get is are you sure? Yeah. Because it did not equal to, but if I change this to two. Mm hmm. Then it'll say, yeah. Okay. New question for you. Mm hmm. Especially going back This remember that spam equals 45. So why did this not remember that's Jen is equal three. Is it because it's not part of the class? No, because you you physically change the value. If if you put all of the Jen's eyes stuff in another block. And you just ran that block
This remember that spam equals 45. So why did this not remember that's Jen is equal three. Is it because it's not part of the class? No, because you you physically change the value. If if you put all of the Jen's eyes stuff in another block. And you just ran that block It would remember what you last had it assigned to. But since inside of this block, you physically change what that value equals. It was like, yeah, no, we're not going to we're not going to keep that other version. And and like, yeah, you're right. You're right
It would remember what you last had it assigned to. But since inside of this block, you physically change what that value equals. It was like, yeah, no, we're not going to we're not going to keep that other version. And and like, yeah, you're right. You're right You're right. It is it is a way to I don't even want to say idiomatic. It's like it's a way of saying like There's this thing called the xenopython and one of the things in the xenopython. It says there should be one and only one way of doing things
You're right. It is it is a way to I don't even want to say idiomatic. It's like it's a way of saying like There's this thing called the xenopython and one of the things in the xenopython. It says there should be one and only one way of doing things I have learned in 10 years of doing python that that is not the case. There is always more than one way to do it. And the answer it depends happens way more than it should
I have learned in 10 years of doing python that that is not the case. There is always more than one way to do it. And the answer it depends happens way more than it should So like when people say things are python what they're saying is this is the this is the way that I subscribe to doing a thing. And that might be the way in many cases. But there are also very, very many times where python as a language moves in a different direction
So like when people say things are python what they're saying is this is the this is the way that I subscribe to doing a thing. And that might be the way in many cases. But there are also very, very many times where python as a language moves in a different direction Like the way that we should have set this up was as a data class, but we don't need to import data classes to find data class and do all this other stuff. None of that is important right now. You're just trying to learn python
Like the way that we should have set this up was as a data class, but we don't need to import data classes to find data class and do all this other stuff. None of that is important right now. You're just trying to learn python So worrying about things like being python or not is like the biggest headache. When it comes to beginners of like, hey, I'm learning the language. I want you to get the successes of I wrote some code and it did the thing
So worrying about things like being python or not is like the biggest headache. When it comes to beginners of like, hey, I'm learning the language. I want you to get the successes of I wrote some code and it did the thing I don't want you to get tied up into like, well, what's the exact right way to do this because As you develop as you grow as a developer, there's going to be more than one way and it will become apparent. What is the right way once you're in those situations
I don't want you to get tied up into like, well, what's the exact right way to do this because As you develop as you grow as a developer, there's going to be more than one way and it will become apparent. What is the right way once you're in those situations You also just gave me an idea to like, I don't know if this is going to work. So I'm just going to try it. Yep. Think I see where you're going. Yeah. Run. Yeah. Yeah. So now let's let's try this. Let's add. Let's add ears into this because in order for glasses to be worn
You also just gave me an idea to like, I don't know if this is going to work. So I'm just going to try it. Yep. Think I see where you're going. Yeah. Run. Yeah. Yeah. So now let's let's try this. Let's add. Let's add ears into this because in order for glasses to be worn They need to hook around something right. So let's do there are a few ways that we can do this. We can nest our if statement or we can just combine it into one line. We're going to do the first one first and then we'll go back and we'll make it later
They need to hook around something right. So let's do there are a few ways that we can do this. We can nest our if statement or we can just combine it into one line. We're going to do the first one first and then we'll go back and we'll make it later So if jins eyes equal to Now we need to check to see if jins has two ears. So how do you how do you think you would do that? If like I want to I don't know the actual Programmatic way of saying it, but like man. Then Yours Equal to do Yeah
So if jins eyes equal to Now we need to check to see if jins has two ears. So how do you how do you think you would do that? If like I want to I don't know the actual Programmatic way of saying it, but like man. Then Yours Equal to do Yeah Yeah, set your set your eyes to two above it so that you can test that and see. Run. Hey. Now let's change your number of ears to. Like this. Like this. That's three. And then run. Well, let's change. Let's change the the value of your ears to because I right now, not in person just in gin
Yeah, set your set your eyes to two above it so that you can test that and see. Run. Hey. Now let's change your number of ears to. Like this. Like this. That's three. And then run. Well, let's change. Let's change the the value of your ears to because I right now, not in person just in gin So like how you have gin eyes equals to just do gin ears equals three. Yours. Gin has three ears now. Okay. So now when you run that, what happens? But if I do. Well, well, first let's let's address nothing printed. Because it didn't match this. So it didn't print anything. Yep
So like how you have gin eyes equals to just do gin ears equals three. Yours. Gin has three ears now. Okay. So now when you run that, what happens? But if I do. Well, well, first let's let's address nothing printed. Because it didn't match this. So it didn't print anything. Yep Yep. But then what would it do next in your logic chain? It would say does Jen have one eye and it didn't have one eye. So no. Does Jen have four eyes? No. So if I say. E lift. How would you say Jen eyes and ears equal anything? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Nice. Equal. Any? I mean, no
Yep. But then what would it do next in your logic chain? It would say does Jen have one eye and it didn't have one eye. So no. Does Jen have four eyes? No. So if I say. E lift. How would you say Jen eyes and ears equal anything? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Nice. Equal. Any? I mean, no Any? I mean, no. I mean, that you could do that. I think what you're trying to do is what's the catch all after that? And that's where else comes in. So else is the is the like, all right, we have concluded that none of the things above are true. Therefore, this is what we're going to do
Any? I mean, no. I mean, that you could do that. I think what you're trying to do is what's the catch all after that? And that's where else comes in. So else is the is the like, all right, we have concluded that none of the things above are true. Therefore, this is what we're going to do You want to add a colon to the end of the L statement. Yeah, right there. Yay. Yeah. So this is making a lot more sense. So here, here's an interesting piece. What if let's, let's change, let's add a value to our class at the top. And also, I know that we've been going for some time
You want to add a colon to the end of the L statement. Yeah, right there. Yay. Yeah. So this is making a lot more sense. So here, here's an interesting piece. What if let's, let's change, let's add a value to our class at the top. And also, I know that we've been going for some time If you need to, if we need to stop. I was going to say, I'm good. I've got nothing planned today. I can do this all day. I can keep going, but I need to buy a break y'all. So I will be. We will be, you know, whatever, however we want to do this, be our B. I'm going to put you on mute. Oh, wait
If you need to, if we need to stop. I was going to say, I'm good. I've got nothing planned today. I can do this all day. I can keep going, but I need to buy a break y'all. So I will be. We will be, you know, whatever, however we want to do this, be our B. I'm going to put you on mute. Oh, wait Oh, wait. I was, I was just going to say this is a great time to do a, hey, J's here, AMA. I do things, ask me questions. I will be sipping my water. It is water. I'm happy to answer any questions
Oh, wait. I was, I was just going to say this is a great time to do a, hey, J's here, AMA. I do things, ask me questions. I will be sipping my water. It is water. I'm happy to answer any questions And I guess the, I don't know how many people I can't see how many people are in the stream or whatever, but can use this as an opportunity to talk about myself. I think as we mentioned at the beginning of the show, I am a cloud advocate over at Microsoft. Just got here, Camamil, I'm doing great
And I guess the, I don't know how many people I can't see how many people are in the stream or whatever, but can use this as an opportunity to talk about myself. I think as we mentioned at the beginning of the show, I am a cloud advocate over at Microsoft. Just got here, Camamil, I'm doing great How are you doing? General, be back. We are, we are going through some, some, let's learn Python stuff. I have been, I think I said 10 years. I don't think that's accurate. I think I've been using Python for eight years. Eight years. Yeah. So I've been a Python developer for eight years
How are you doing? General, be back. We are, we are going through some, some, let's learn Python stuff. I have been, I think I said 10 years. I don't think that's accurate. I think I've been using Python for eight years. Eight years. Yeah. So I've been a Python developer for eight years I'm in San Diego home of the amazing San Diego Python. Oh, how long have I been using Python? Just answered that. My favorite modules in standard library. That's a good one. I am a fan of the only because it's a standard library. I'm a fan of it or tools
I'm in San Diego home of the amazing San Diego Python. Oh, how long have I been using Python? Just answered that. My favorite modules in standard library. That's a good one. I am a fan of the only because it's a standard library. I'm a fan of it or tools I have, like I said, I used to be an automator. That's how I got started with Python was automating my job as a system administrator back in the day. So a lot of functional programming happened there
I have, like I said, I used to be an automator. That's how I got started with Python was automating my job as a system administrator back in the day. So a lot of functional programming happened there So you use a lot of iteration tools, which is why when we're talking about doing if LF and all that stuff, I love that. Do I love or hate match statement? I haven't found as many uses for match statement that I would like
So you use a lot of iteration tools, which is why when we're talking about doing if LF and all that stuff, I love that. Do I love or hate match statement? I haven't found as many uses for match statement that I would like I do think that where gin is at now where she's trying to do like pattern matching stuff. I do think match statement would be good for this
I do think that where gin is at now where she's trying to do like pattern matching stuff. I do think match statement would be good for this But also I feel like teaching someone that doesn't know a lot of Python, the match statement is like giving a toddler a hammer or a chainsaw and being like, hey, do chainsaw. I don't know how to use them properly. I don't know how to use them properly. There is a talk that my boss gave at Python
But also I feel like teaching someone that doesn't know a lot of Python, the match statement is like giving a toddler a hammer or a chainsaw and being like, hey, do chainsaw. I don't know how to use them properly. I don't know how to use them properly. There is a talk that my boss gave at Python You love the case like ABC. So match like match statement is very much for pattern matching. So what you'll often get is someone tries to use match statement to shortcut a bunch of logic. And that's not what it's designed for. That's actually slower than just doing statements. Yeah
You love the case like ABC. So match like match statement is very much for pattern matching. So what you'll often get is someone tries to use match statement to shortcut a bunch of logic. And that's not what it's designed for. That's actually slower than just doing statements. Yeah Yeah. If you're, if you're doing a long and deep if else chain, that sounds like a refactoring question. I would even say probably don't want to use match statements for that either. You probably want to do some refactoring of code
Yeah. If you're, if you're doing a long and deep if else chain, that sounds like a refactoring question. I would even say probably don't want to use match statements for that either. You probably want to do some refactoring of code If you have a bunch of different cases like what we're doing, the match statement would actually be really great for this, but we're not there yet. We'll get there. What did I miss? Oh, answering questions. Yeah. I feel like we should like have AMAs like guess yet I am starting a real job
If you have a bunch of different cases like what we're doing, the match statement would actually be really great for this, but we're not there yet. We'll get there. What did I miss? Oh, answering questions. Yeah. I feel like we should like have AMAs like guess yet I am starting a real job I actually pay me job soon. And I'm like, I don't really know what's going to happen with my life after that. Yeah. And I hope I get to keep streaming, but I know that I will have to cut back on some things
I actually pay me job soon. And I'm like, I don't really know what's going to happen with my life after that. Yeah. And I hope I get to keep streaming, but I know that I will have to cut back on some things And I think Monday's and Fridays are usually like my Monday is like I just need to figure out I need a slow start to the week. So that's when I do stream on Monday. So it's like I want to work on something that I want to work on. So let me just dedicate some time
And I think Monday's and Fridays are usually like my Monday is like I just need to figure out I need a slow start to the week. So that's when I do stream on Monday. So it's like I want to work on something that I want to work on. So let me just dedicate some time And then Fridays are Fridays or Saturday for my boss. So I'm very much like this is me doing my job. This is me being in the community. I called Fridays like community Fridays. I also work Saturday morning. So because I again, when you work for like I work for Microsoft
And then Fridays are Fridays or Saturday for my boss. So I'm very much like this is me doing my job. This is me being in the community. I called Fridays like community Fridays. I also work Saturday morning. So because I again, when you work for like I work for Microsoft So we sponsor the user group that I'm a part of. So it's my job to be at that user group. So it's it gets it gets fuzzy. So I I borrow time that I'll make up on the weekend and other places as a part of my job and my job responsibilities
So we sponsor the user group that I'm a part of. So it's my job to be at that user group. So it's it gets it gets fuzzy. So I I borrow time that I'll make up on the weekend and other places as a part of my job and my job responsibilities I love that because it's definitely like with a job I'm starting. They were like, Hey, have office hours. So people know when you're probably going to be there. Yeah. If you got a book time book time, if you're most creative, not during that time, don't worry about it
I love that because it's definitely like with a job I'm starting. They were like, Hey, have office hours. So people know when you're probably going to be there. Yeah. If you got a book time book time, if you're most creative, not during that time, don't worry about it Like, I'm like, okay, that works because I will be the biggest challenge for developer advocates is that it's like, how do I get my work done. But also figure out where like where do I do my community stuff. And the answer is your community stuff is also your job
Like, I'm like, okay, that works because I will be the biggest challenge for developer advocates is that it's like, how do I get my work done. But also figure out where like where do I do my community stuff. And the answer is your community stuff is also your job So if you have to go to a meetup later that day, you go to work late the next day or you leave work early and make that time up. That's how you prevent people from feeling a lot of burnout, which is a pain. Yes. And y'all just for an update. I got a job. Yeah
So if you have to go to a meetup later that day, you go to work late the next day or you leave work early and make that time up. That's how you prevent people from feeling a lot of burnout, which is a pain. Yes. And y'all just for an update. I got a job. Yeah I got a job. Yeah. I'm not announcing where yet until I start next Thursday. So I will share the details then. I can't say it is as a developer advocate. So what I've been working on the last seven months. Yeah. Thank you, Camel meal. It's definitely something I'm excited about
I got a job. Yeah. I'm not announcing where yet until I start next Thursday. So I will share the details then. I can't say it is as a developer advocate. So what I've been working on the last seven months. Yeah. Thank you, Camel meal. It's definitely something I'm excited about It's went a lot of work. Like I've done a lot of work towards it before I started streaming just in my like career progression yet the visibility and learning tech has only been the last seven months that I've been working on that. So it's pretty cool. I'm stoked
It's went a lot of work. Like I've done a lot of work towards it before I started streaming just in my like career progression yet the visibility and learning tech has only been the last seven months that I've been working on that. So it's pretty cool. I'm stoked I'm stoked. Anyway, we have been doing stuff to our if statement. We've been doing we've been doing programmatic body modifications here. And there was a thing that came up in the chat about using a match statement instead of if an LF. I want you to know that this is a thing that exists
I'm stoked. Anyway, we have been doing stuff to our if statement. We've been doing we've been doing programmatic body modifications here. And there was a thing that came up in the chat about using a match statement instead of if an LF. I want you to know that this is a thing that exists And we're not talking about it right now because we really want to understand you're going to use if you're probably going to use if and else more than anything else. L if comes into play from time to time
And we're not talking about it right now because we really want to understand you're going to use if you're probably going to use if and else more than anything else. L if comes into play from time to time I don't want to overload you with like there's this other thing that does a thing and it is very similar to this thing and it could work in our case. But let's let's get a real good grip on like how we would make this work. Just looking really quick
I don't want to overload you with like there's this other thing that does a thing and it is very similar to this thing and it could work in our case. But let's let's get a real good grip on like how we would make this work. Just looking really quick If do you think it might be under lists, lists might do matching. I'm just thinking I'm putting a note and saying, okay, I'm just going to say it's actually because it's new. It's only been around for three years. So it may not even be in this book. But just know that there is another thing
If do you think it might be under lists, lists might do matching. I'm just thinking I'm putting a note and saying, okay, I'm just going to say it's actually because it's new. It's only been around for three years. So it may not even be in this book. But just know that there is another thing Well, I'm not even sure. I'm not sure if Al is updated the book lately. I know he he writes a lot of books and he also does them on stream. So. Yeah, he does have newer versions, which that's reminded me that like things in the website may not match my book. Yeah. Go support Al swagger
Well, I'm not even sure. I'm not sure if Al is updated the book lately. I know he he writes a lot of books and he also does them on stream. So. Yeah, he does have newer versions, which that's reminded me that like things in the website may not match my book. Yeah. Go support Al swagger He's he's very good. He's actually he's speaking at a couple of conferences in the next few months. He's speaking at Python web conference and he's speaking. I think he's speaking at Python. He'll be at Python. I will say at one point his Twitter was private
He's he's very good. He's actually he's speaking at a couple of conferences in the next few months. He's speaking at Python web conference and he's speaking. I think he's speaking at Python. He'll be at Python. I will say at one point his Twitter was private So I tried following during that time and it's public again. So we're going to be on like master on doing master on things. I don't know. Yeah. I'm I'm just trying to see what version. I have no idea. It's probably at the bottom. I have a second edition, but maybe I saw it on one of his streams
So I tried following during that time and it's public again. So we're going to be on like master on doing master on things. I don't know. Yeah. I'm I'm just trying to see what version. I have no idea. It's probably at the bottom. I have a second edition, but maybe I saw it on one of his streams It really could be what I'm thinking of. That he was talking about like I thought version for. Yeah, there's probably a there may be a third addition getting like reviewed. And then that means he's probably already started working on the fourth edition
It really could be what I'm thinking of. That he was talking about like I thought version for. Yeah, there's probably a there may be a third addition getting like reviewed. And then that means he's probably already started working on the fourth edition And something that I found as a newbie coder and as my own learning processes, especially with being dyslexic is yes, there's the website version, but I also have the hard back so that way I can take notes with where they are. I'm going to be able to use text to speech and that's how I learn
And something that I found as a newbie coder and as my own learning processes, especially with being dyslexic is yes, there's the website version, but I also have the hard back so that way I can take notes with where they are. I'm going to be able to use text to speech and that's how I learn So suggestion for everyone because that's how I'm learning both Python and TypeScript and also keeping them organized in my brain. Yeah, and some some like services will let you it'll just give you the all the versions. If you want them. If you buy one, though, that you have multiple versions
So suggestion for everyone because that's how I'm learning both Python and TypeScript and also keeping them organized in my brain. Yeah, and some some like services will let you it'll just give you the all the versions. If you want them. If you buy one, though, that you have multiple versions Okay, back to our code. Back to code. I did want to say when we're done with this, I think the next part just in case this helps knowing it is loops. Yeah, we're going to get there. There's going to be more than one person. Oh my goodness, there's going to be more than one. Yeah, okay
Okay, back to our code. Back to code. I did want to say when we're done with this, I think the next part just in case this helps knowing it is loops. Yeah, we're going to get there. There's going to be more than one person. Oh my goodness, there's going to be more than one. Yeah, okay Yeah, okay. Let's clean up our class a little bit. Let's go up to the top. We're going to change a few things. This is a glasses company now. It just they just specialize in glasses and I I accessories. Nope, this is still a person
Yeah, okay. Let's clean up our class a little bit. Let's go up to the top. We're going to change a few things. This is a glasses company now. It just they just specialize in glasses and I I accessories. Nope, this is still a person Our person, we would just call them a customer or something like that. But we don't need to worry about the mouth. We're doing glasses things. We don't mouth mouth is not necessary here. Hair. Let's change hair to hair length
Our person, we would just call them a customer or something like that. But we don't need to worry about the mouth. We're doing glasses things. We don't mouth mouth is not necessary here. Hair. Let's change hair to hair length And we're going to make it a string and we're going to say that string is long. We're going to hair underscore length. Okay. So with Python, we use underscores. JavaScript, they do the they do the camel casing. We do all does camel casing too
And we're going to make it a string and we're going to say that string is long. We're going to hair underscore length. Okay. So with Python, we use underscores. JavaScript, they do the they do the camel casing. We do all does camel casing too All does camel casing because Al came from a different language. We talk about that. I give Al so much crap about doing stuff like that. It's like, okay, you can you can stop with that anytime. I forgot what casing this is called. Caba casing. That's caba case. And what is that's that's snake case
All does camel casing because Al came from a different language. We talk about that. I give Al so much crap about doing stuff like that. It's like, okay, you can you can stop with that anytime. I forgot what casing this is called. Caba casing. That's caba case. And what is that's that's snake case Because it makes a little snake. Okay, I'm just writing these down really quick because it's a question I keep asking. Actually, well, no, never mind. I can't show you that one. I can't show it to you just because it'll it'll only confuse more than it helps
Because it makes a little snake. Okay, I'm just writing these down really quick because it's a question I keep asking. Actually, well, no, never mind. I can't show you that one. I can't show it to you just because it'll it'll only confuse more than it helps Because my boss has a GitHub repo that has like all the cases and some of them are silly and should never be used. And that is intentional. And then the other one was called kebab. Yeah. Because it looks like a kebab
Because my boss has a GitHub repo that has like all the cases and some of them are silly and should never be used. And that is intentional. And then the other one was called kebab. Yeah. Because it looks like a kebab And then you have camel case, which is lowercase front end and uppercase every word in the middle, which is what you do with nothing in Python or you should do with nothing in Python. But there are some things that exist from a long time ago that were like that. So they say like that
And then you have camel case, which is lowercase front end and uppercase every word in the middle, which is what you do with nothing in Python or you should do with nothing in Python. But there are some things that exist from a long time ago that were like that. So they say like that All right, let's change our hair length. We're just going to make it a string. And we're going to make that string long short or bald. Give me a second. I'm thinking. Let's just assign it. Assign it as long for now. I'm just saying that it'll be that's going to be check for. Yeah. All right
All right, let's change our hair length. We're just going to make it a string. And we're going to make that string long short or bald. Give me a second. I'm thinking. Let's just assign it. Assign it as long for now. I'm just saying that it'll be that's going to be check for. Yeah. All right Yeah. All right. So, and we don't have to change any of this stuff. Maybe let's let's remove the ears issue here. Okay. So as as our glasses company. We have a few options. We're just let's just write these out. We're not we don't necessarily need to know what they are
Yeah. All right. So, and we don't have to change any of this stuff. Maybe let's let's remove the ears issue here. Okay. So as as our glasses company. We have a few options. We're just let's just write these out. We're not we don't necessarily need to know what they are You can even put them in comments. Let's say we have glasses. Are for people with two eyes, two ears, and a nose. Also, also knows let's just make that true false. So knows we're going to just set that to true. Capital T. All right. Cool. Okay
You can even put them in comments. Let's say we have glasses. Are for people with two eyes, two ears, and a nose. Also, also knows let's just make that true false. So knows we're going to just set that to true. Capital T. All right. Cool. Okay Cool. Okay. So anybody that has two eyes, two ears, and a nose can can wear glasses. Right. We have monocles. Which are for people who have one eye. I have no idea how to spell monocles. I think it's. M-a-m-o-n-a-c-l-e-s. That's fine. We know what you're talking about
Cool. Okay. So anybody that has two eyes, two ears, and a nose can can wear glasses. Right. We have monocles. Which are for people who have one eye. I have no idea how to spell monocles. I think it's. M-a-m-o-n-a-c-l-e-s. That's fine. We know what you're talking about But yeah, for people with one eye. We don't we don't care about nose or ears because you pin the monocle to your shirt. So I think I just named some this is actually just a. What I just saying them is a bad guy in a. Game. So I'm going to leave it there as a bad guy because we also have
But yeah, for people with one eye. We don't we don't care about nose or ears because you pin the monocle to your shirt. So I think I just named some this is actually just a. What I just saying them is a bad guy in a. Game. So I'm going to leave it there as a bad guy because we also have What was the off. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to add an app to the word. Okay. That works. There's an end of octathor. I believe. Has one eye. You don't need a nose for a monocle. It just sits on the eye right there. Yeah, but how does it stay? Yes, squint really hard. Okay
What was the off. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to add an app to the word. Okay. That works. There's an end of octathor. I believe. Has one eye. You don't need a nose for a monocle. It just sits on the eye right there. Yeah, but how does it stay? Yes, squint really hard. Okay Okay. It's supposed to rest in your eyes. Okay. Then we have an eye patch. Which is for. For. You need. And I patch is for someone who has one eye. And. At least one ear. Well, I mean. Okay. No, this is good. This is good logic. What other eyewear is there? I feel like that is it
Okay. It's supposed to rest in your eyes. Okay. Then we have an eye patch. Which is for. For. You need. And I patch is for someone who has one eye. And. At least one ear. Well, I mean. Okay. No, this is good. This is good logic. What other eyewear is there? I feel like that is it What do you for the octathor. I don't know. Maybe he'll be our bad guy. He'll be our villain. He'll be the next. He'll be one of the customers. Oh, my goodness. It was all the classes. Sure. I like it. Okay. So, you were now. If you were. If this is this is lens crafters. New. Computer. Matching
What do you for the octathor. I don't know. Maybe he'll be our bad guy. He'll be our villain. He'll be the next. He'll be one of the customers. Oh, my goodness. It was all the classes. Sure. I like it. Okay. So, you were now. If you were. If this is this is lens crafters. New. Computer. Matching Computer. Matching. I program. So let's start with. First of all, you have a customer. So we have our person. Our person is Jen. Jen is that person. Jen says, Hey, I need. I wear. I'm glad you mentioned the 2020 vision thing
Computer. Matching. I program. So let's start with. First of all, you have a customer. So we have our person. Our person is Jen. Jen is that person. Jen says, Hey, I need. I wear. I'm glad you mentioned the 2020 vision thing Because that means we can have things like sunglasses that are non prescription. Um. So. We have our logic here. So we say. If. Eyes. Go up to your person class. Um. Add an attribute there that is called. Prescription or prescription, right. I think that's how he's about it
Because that means we can have things like sunglasses that are non prescription. Um. So. We have our logic here. So we say. If. Eyes. Go up to your person class. Um. Add an attribute there that is called. Prescription or prescription, right. I think that's how he's about it We're going to go with yes. That's fine. Yeah. That's just true or false. They either need a prescription or they don't. So. If you went into lens crafters, the first thing that they would ask you is. Do you need a prescription or do you need non prescription? Right. So how would you check for
We're going to go with yes. That's fine. Yeah. That's just true or false. They either need a prescription or they don't. So. If you went into lens crafters, the first thing that they would ask you is. Do you need a prescription or do you need non prescription? Right. So how would you check for If Jen prescription. I kind of said it there. I'm glad you wrote it that way so that I can tell you the quote unquote, python way to do it. If you were to just write Jen dot prescription, you would get true or false. And remember, if statement only cares about if a thing is true
If Jen prescription. I kind of said it there. I'm glad you wrote it that way so that I can tell you the quote unquote, python way to do it. If you were to just write Jen dot prescription, you would get true or false. And remember, if statement only cares about if a thing is true Oh, so you wouldn't need this. You don't need that. You can just say if Jen prescription. That's it. What about the colon? You still need to call it. Yeah. Okay. Uh, then I could say. Print. And then what? Wait. What do you. Let's let's not do a print. Yeah. Okay. I guess you can do
Oh, so you wouldn't need this. You don't need that. You can just say if Jen prescription. That's it. What about the colon? You still need to call it. Yeah. Okay. Uh, then I could say. Print. And then what? Wait. What do you. Let's let's not do a print. Yeah. Okay. I guess you can do I guess you can do. You can do a print. But maybe we'll. We'll use the prints for the logic. That's fine. Okay. So. As. I pick needs prescription as a variable name just so that if statements read nicer. Yeah. You could do that. You would also. You would also maybe like. You could. Or
I guess you can do. You can do a print. But maybe we'll. We'll use the prints for the logic. That's fine. Okay. So. As. I pick needs prescription as a variable name just so that if statements read nicer. Yeah. You could do that. You would also. You would also maybe like. You could. Or You could. Or. Or, maybe we could do this. So there would be a lot of the next. In the future. Like, there would be a bunch of composition happening. And then needs prescription would be like a method that says like. Takes I test or whatever. But. Yeah, you could
You could. Or. Or, maybe we could do this. So there would be a lot of the next. In the future. Like, there would be a bunch of composition happening. And then needs prescription would be like a method that says like. Takes I test or whatever. But. Yeah, you could Yeah, you could. You can change it to needs prescription. You can change it to. You can leave it at prescription. Just whatever is going to work for you. description. And then you want to change the prescription attribute in the class and the person class to needs prescription. Oh, okay. Perfect
Yeah, you could. You can change it to needs prescription. You can change it to. You can leave it at prescription. Just whatever is going to work for you. description. And then you want to change the prescription attribute in the class and the person class to needs prescription. Oh, okay. Perfect Oh, okay. Perfect. Okay, that makes more sense. Yeah. Okay. And what up, Data Dev? Okay, so you say great. Okay, so now if they need a prescription, then we know that we have to we have to eliminate eye patches from the table and we have to eliminate non prescription sunglasses or designer frames
Oh, okay. Perfect. Okay, that makes more sense. Yeah. Okay. And what up, Data Dev? Okay, so you say great. Okay, so now if they need a prescription, then we know that we have to we have to eliminate eye patches from the table and we have to eliminate non prescription sunglasses or designer frames And again, these are all things that we could build later on that we're not really accounting for. So right now we're just eliminating eye patches from from our selection. But if they need a prescription, that means we need to give them either a monocle or glasses
And again, these are all things that we could build later on that we're not really accounting for. So right now we're just eliminating eye patches from from our selection. But if they need a prescription, that means we need to give them either a monocle or glasses So how would what do we need to check for that to determine whether or not we need a monocle or we need glasses? I'm trying to think of how to put it into one statement, but it sounds like well, no, I'm just asking what is the what is our thing that we're using to like we wrote it up above
So how would what do we need to check for that to determine whether or not we need a monocle or we need glasses? I'm trying to think of how to put it into one statement, but it sounds like well, no, I'm just asking what is the what is our thing that we're using to like we wrote it up above Yeah, like if eyes are if gen dot eyes equal to wait, I see what I'm doing. Equal to you. Then then I don't know how to write this if eyes equal to then glasses if you eyes equal one, then mon molecule, whatever is called. But do I would do a here? I would do it underneath. It would be so here
Yeah, like if eyes are if gen dot eyes equal to wait, I see what I'm doing. Equal to you. Then then I don't know how to write this if eyes equal to then glasses if you eyes equal one, then mon molecule, whatever is called. But do I would do a here? I would do it underneath. It would be so here You fell for my trap card, which is great. Right now your second if statement is on the same level as your prescription. We want to put that if statement inside. Oh yeah, can I delete all these other ones? They're absolutely. You can do whatever you want. And so I want this to go inside of here
You fell for my trap card, which is great. Right now your second if statement is on the same level as your prescription. We want to put that if statement inside. Oh yeah, can I delete all these other ones? They're absolutely. You can do whatever you want. And so I want this to go inside of here Yeah. Which would be like this? No, see, it's correct. I mean, again, I don't know why they're only doing the single thing, but that's fine. It is what it actually know it does look like it is for. Okay, never mind. This is perfect. Yeah, perfect. It just looks spacing is weird
Yeah. Which would be like this? No, see, it's correct. I mean, again, I don't know why they're only doing the single thing, but that's fine. It is what it actually know it does look like it is for. Okay, never mind. This is perfect. Yeah, perfect. It just looks spacing is weird This is where like mono space fonts are nice because then everything is the same width and then you stuff lines up pretty. Okay, so now we're checking for eyes, but we also need to check for ears. And this is where we could we could do an end statement
This is where like mono space fonts are nice because then everything is the same width and then you stuff lines up pretty. Okay, so now we're checking for eyes, but we also need to check for ears. And this is where we could we could do an end statement We could say if gen i is equals to and gen ears is equal to two. Yeah. Then we would print glasses are an option for you. Or like prescription glasses are an option. There you go. So then and also just so you know, these are how decision trees get made
We could say if gen i is equals to and gen ears is equal to two. Yeah. Then we would print glasses are an option for you. Or like prescription glasses are an option. There you go. So then and also just so you know, these are how decision trees get made So like, those little chatbots that you talk to that are not, you know, chat GPT or whatever, like that are like, oh, hey, can you put in your number and then it puts in your number and it goes, it checks for that number. Does this person have an account? Cool. This person has an account
So like, those little chatbots that you talk to that are not, you know, chat GPT or whatever, like that are like, oh, hey, can you put in your number and then it puts in your number and it goes, it checks for that number. Does this person have an account? Cool. This person has an account Which do you want to choose from and then you just check that value and like that's that's how those chatbots get made. It's like this nested chain of these things. There you go. I like it. That is what it's going to be named. Okay
Which do you want to choose from and then you just check that value and like that's that's how those chatbots get made. It's like this nested chain of these things. There you go. I like it. That is what it's going to be named. Okay Okay. So this, this is actually an interesting thing that this is where that Python question comes into play. Okay. You can do this one of two ways. What you've written will 100% work the way that it is now
Okay. So this, this is actually an interesting thing that this is where that Python question comes into play. Okay. You can do this one of two ways. What you've written will 100% work the way that it is now Having two if statements, one just being false, you decide to do a thing or you just skip over it and then you just have another if statement to check. However, if you have two eyes and two ears, that already means that you don't only have one eye
Having two if statements, one just being false, you decide to do a thing or you just skip over it and then you just have another if statement to check. However, if you have two eyes and two ears, that already means that you don't only have one eye So you can do an if else, you can do an LIF statement so that it skips that check. You can do, actually, no, that's it. That's all you can do is an LIF statement or you can leave it as two if statements. Now, I feel like I shouldn't have deleted what I wrote earlier because now that is gone
So you can do an if else, you can do an LIF statement so that it skips that check. You can do, actually, no, that's it. That's all you can do is an LIF statement or you can leave it as two if statements. Now, I feel like I shouldn't have deleted what I wrote earlier because now that is gone I'm like, wait, I really want to say if neither of these work talk to an associate. So that's where you have, there's kind of like three flows that you can go through. You can just have if a thing is true, do something. Yeah. And then the otherwise is do nothing
I'm like, wait, I really want to say if neither of these work talk to an associate. So that's where you have, there's kind of like three flows that you can go through. You can just have if a thing is true, do something. Yeah. And then the otherwise is do nothing So you're either doing something or you're doing nothing. You can also do if else, so then you can do if this is true, then do this otherwise do this other thing. And then you can do if LIF else, which is if this is true, do this thing, otherwise check to see if this other thing is true
So you're either doing something or you're doing nothing. You can also do if else, so then you can do if this is true, then do this otherwise do this other thing. And then you can do if LIF else, which is if this is true, do this thing, otherwise check to see if this other thing is true And then if it's true, then do this thing. And then if none of those things are true, then go to the L statement. Okay. But then if I want to keep building this out, I could do. Oh, wait, no, bye. Okay. That needs to go there. But if I wanted to continue, so if Jen needs prescription, great
And then if it's true, then do this thing. And then if none of those things are true, then go to the L statement. Okay. But then if I want to keep building this out, I could do. Oh, wait, no, bye. Okay. That needs to go there. But if I wanted to continue, so if Jen needs prescription, great But if not, would it be an else? Yes. You also have a small little bug here. I mean, if you want to do this, you can do this here. Right now you have an if, if else, which means the first if isn't going to generate an else statement
But if not, would it be an else? Yes. You also have a small little bug here. I mean, if you want to do this, you can do this here. Right now you have an if, if else, which means the first if isn't going to generate an else statement I think what you want to do is, as Fikis says here, an if L if else. Because the else statement only works on the last if that was there. There you go. Please explain
I think what you want to do is, as Fikis says here, an if L if else. Because the else statement only works on the last if that was there. There you go. Please explain Please explain. Because like I get the words you're saying and I can change it, but I'm not like, computing why we're going to we're going to look at the camera for this one. So you have your if statement right here, right? Okay. Yes
Please explain. Because like I get the words you're saying and I can change it, but I'm not like, computing why we're going to we're going to look at the camera for this one. So you have your if statement right here, right? Okay. Yes Yes. So then if you have an L statement underneath it, it goes, is this true? If it's true, we ignore this. This goes away. If this is false, then do this thing here. So that's if else, right? Yeah
Yes. So then if you have an L statement underneath it, it goes, is this true? If it's true, we ignore this. This goes away. If this is false, then do this thing here. So that's if else, right? Yeah So then you have if L if else, is this true? If this is true, these go away and it just does this thing. Okay. If this is false, is this true? If this is true, then this goes away. If this is false and this is false, then you do this thing down here. That's if L if else
So then you have if L if else, is this true? If this is true, these go away and it just does this thing. Okay. If this is false, is this true? If this is true, then this goes away. If this is false and this is false, then you do this thing down here. That's if L if else And the thing is you can have if L if L if else at the bottom and that works. Okay. Okay. Now if you just do just if if goes away, if you have two, I can't do two ifs
And the thing is you can have if L if L if else at the bottom and that works. Okay. Okay. Now if you just do just if if goes away, if you have two, I can't do two ifs I don't know if if and if if this is if and this is if and you have an L statement here, this if statement has nothing to do with this if else relationship. So if you have if and that's not true, that doesn't change any of this relationship. It'll still check for both of these values
I don't know if if and if if this is if and this is if and you have an L statement here, this if statement has nothing to do with this if else relationship. So if you have if and that's not true, that doesn't change any of this relationship. It'll still check for both of these values If you have if an L if, then this being true means that this is false or not that this is false. If this is true, that means it doesn't worry about this. So that's why if you do if if else, the first if doesn't matter anymore, because it's it's never going to say otherwise go do this other thing
If you have if an L if, then this being true means that this is false or not that this is false. If this is true, that means it doesn't worry about this. So that's why if you do if if else, the first if doesn't matter anymore, because it's it's never going to say otherwise go do this other thing But if you do if L if it only checks the L if if the first thing wasn't true and then if nothing in between those are true, then it'll go to the L statement. Okay. I'm going to read this first and then ask this next question because it may it may hamster it
But if you do if L if it only checks the L if if the first thing wasn't true and then if nothing in between those are true, then it'll go to the L statement. Okay. I'm going to read this first and then ask this next question because it may it may hamster it You basically only want one of these cases to run with and if L if else, then only one of them will trigger if you have an if if else, then the first one will run the then the second if else is checked
You basically only want one of these cases to run with and if L if else, then only one of them will trigger if you have an if if else, then the first one will run the then the second if else is checked So you could potentially do the first thing and the second thing or the first thing and the last thing. Yeah. So could I have written this since it's also nested
So you could potentially do the first thing and the second thing or the first thing and the last thing. Yeah. So could I have written this since it's also nested But if this is nest, could I have written this first if in L if instead of an if could I just L if we can't see the entire world by the way. Oh, just kidding. Thanks. Thanks. I just want it to switch in my head on screen. But if I wanted to could I put just L if L if else
But if this is nest, could I have written this first if in L if instead of an if could I just L if we can't see the entire world by the way. Oh, just kidding. Thanks. Thanks. I just want it to switch in my head on screen. But if I wanted to could I put just L if L if else No, it needs to be if so if is the only one that's required, you can have if without L if or else. But you have to have well, you have to have else, you have to have if before you can have L if and else
No, it needs to be if so if is the only one that's required, you can have if without L if or else. But you have to have well, you have to have else, you have to have if before you can have L if and else There is another thing that you can do that like L statements you'll see in other areas of Python. But in this case, if can is the only one that can exist on its own. What you're saying makes sense yet in my I don't understand yet new to programming. I'm like, that does it logically makes sense
There is another thing that you can do that like L statements you'll see in other areas of Python. But in this case, if can is the only one that can exist on its own. What you're saying makes sense yet in my I don't understand yet new to programming. I'm like, that does it logically makes sense Why can't you do an L if L if L if it makes sense. It just, you know, because you can't have you can't have an L because remember L if means else if. Okay. So like in JavaScript, there is no L if JavaScript has else if. Okay. Okay. I think that doesn't have an L if pretty sure it doesn't
Why can't you do an L if L if L if it makes sense. It just, you know, because you can't have you can't have an L because remember L if means else if. Okay. So like in JavaScript, there is no L if JavaScript has else if. Okay. Okay. I think that doesn't have an L if pretty sure it doesn't So if I wanted to do L if here. What would be the thing that you're checking? Do you have? Oh, never mind. I forgot you're in you're in a notebook. So I don't know if you can even fold. Can you fold text in a notebook? Yes, you can. Okay. So I would just do else now
So if I wanted to do L if here. What would be the thing that you're checking? Do you have? Oh, never mind. I forgot you're in you're in a notebook. So I don't know if you can even fold. Can you fold text in a notebook? Yes, you can. Okay. So I would just do else now Note that if else is not actually one thing it's two things. Yeah, that's that's what we're saying. It's if and then it's else. Yes. That's what we were trying to break down altos. And hello, altos. This is me having fun learning programming concepts. I actually built out my website
Note that if else is not actually one thing it's two things. Yeah, that's that's what we're saying. It's if and then it's else. Yes. That's what we were trying to break down altos. And hello, altos. This is me having fun learning programming concepts. I actually built out my website I'm very proud of my astro website. Yeah, I like the astro website. Yeah, it looks nice. It looks better than my website. Well, thank you. Thank you. But at the same time, I'm like, these like core fundamentals. I'm just like, we can really grumpy. Don't worry, a click will happen at some point
I'm very proud of my astro website. Yeah, I like the astro website. Yeah, it looks nice. It looks better than my website. Well, thank you. Thank you. But at the same time, I'm like, these like core fundamentals. I'm just like, we can really grumpy. Don't worry, a click will happen at some point If not today, it'll happen at some point. You'll just like, it makes sense now. And then. And this is why I'm doing it. Because I'm like, you know what? If I want to be able to do this, I got to take time and learn and practice and also not get frustrated that it doesn't work. Yeah. Yeah
If not today, it'll happen at some point. You'll just like, it makes sense now. And then. And this is why I'm doing it. Because I'm like, you know what? If I want to be able to do this, I got to take time and learn and practice and also not get frustrated that it doesn't work. Yeah. Yeah Yeah. Yeah. All right. So going back to the first statement, we did not the Pythianic way. Pythene stick way. Pythit. The way Python likes it is you don't have to say is true because it's like, it just notes that. Yeah. It's what it's checking for
Yeah. Yeah. All right. So going back to the first statement, we did not the Pythianic way. Pythene stick way. Pythit. The way Python likes it is you don't have to say is true because it's like, it just notes that. Yeah. It's what it's checking for Like anytime you see the word if what it wants it to say is, is whatever you are about to tell me eventually equate to true. So would I say else or would I say else if Jen needs prescription? If I wanted to go through what not prescription
Like anytime you see the word if what it wants it to say is, is whatever you are about to tell me eventually equate to true. So would I say else or would I say else if Jen needs prescription? If I wanted to go through what not prescription So you're saying, so if it's true, then if it's not true, then it's false. Else is just the this is not true. So then you're do something else. Right. Yeah
So you're saying, so if it's true, then if it's not true, then it's false. Else is just the this is not true. So then you're do something else. Right. Yeah Right. Yeah. So if I wanted to do it that way, because the else would have other if statements, it would be if in the else, if I have to look at this one just to see what else we asked. Yeah. Like this. This is you I'm just gonna copy and paste it
Right. Yeah. So if I wanted to do it that way, because the else would have other if statements, it would be if in the else, if I have to look at this one just to see what else we asked. Yeah. Like this. This is you I'm just gonna copy and paste it And this is the fun part of programming because there is more than one way to do this. There are several ways in which we can do this. Thanks. You did it. I'm just gonna. I don't know why it's yelling at me, but I'm gonna do a print here too. Just to make it like this groovy. If Jen has print
And this is the fun part of programming because there is more than one way to do this. There are several ways in which we can do this. Thanks. You did it. I'm just gonna. I don't know why it's yelling at me, but I'm gonna do a print here too. Just to make it like this groovy. If Jen has print If Jen has print. The fun part is then to argue that your way is best. See this this is this is where I don't I don't subscribe to one way I subscribe to just like how did someone do a thing occasionally
If Jen has print. The fun part is then to argue that your way is best. See this this is this is where I don't I don't subscribe to one way I subscribe to just like how did someone do a thing occasionally There are like data science reasons for doing something differently, but most of those are like what's going to be easiest red and then what's going to be more performant
There are like data science reasons for doing something differently, but most of those are like what's going to be easiest red and then what's going to be more performant And then you have that balance that dance in between them because yeah, and in most cases now performance for what for what Jen's doing will not be important unless we're doing like some file automation stuff and then we absolutely want that to be because I've fallen into that trap
And then you have that balance that dance in between them because yeah, and in most cases now performance for what for what Jen's doing will not be important unless we're doing like some file automation stuff and then we absolutely want that to be because I've fallen into that trap My claim to fame in Python. And this was the thing that made me want to become a professional developer while Jen's typing things out. I mentioned before I was automating myself out of a job quite literally
My claim to fame in Python. And this was the thing that made me want to become a professional developer while Jen's typing things out. I mentioned before I was automating myself out of a job quite literally And we the company that I worked for acquired another company and it was my job to add their products to our online e-commerce platform database thing. And they had 40,000 items that needed to be added
And we the company that I worked for acquired another company and it was my job to add their products to our online e-commerce platform database thing. And they had 40,000 items that needed to be added And it was in a spreadsheet and the spreadsheet matched to files in a system and each one had its own thing and there was a whole lot of stuff. So in that case, you can do a like iterate through the spreadsheet and then go find the file and then do some file things
And it was in a spreadsheet and the spreadsheet matched to files in a system and each one had its own thing and there was a whole lot of stuff. So in that case, you can do a like iterate through the spreadsheet and then go find the file and then do some file things But it's actually faster to do it the other way around. Start by iterating through the file, identify inside of your one spreadsheet where that file is and get the rest of the information. And that's where it's like one of those things where like doing it one way versus the other
But it's actually faster to do it the other way around. Start by iterating through the file, identify inside of your one spreadsheet where that file is and get the rest of the information. And that's where it's like one of those things where like doing it one way versus the other I started doing it the first way. And it looked like it was going to take about 32 hours to go through these 40,000 items and do a bunch of stuff. The other way around took six hours. So like you literally cut like five, six of the time. So I don't know what that is, math wise
I started doing it the first way. And it looked like it was going to take about 32 hours to go through these 40,000 items and do a bunch of stuff. The other way around took six hours. So like you literally cut like five, six of the time. So I don't know what that is, math wise That's like a bunch of percentage, like 85% of the time off by doing it one way versus the other. And that's when it's like sure it is performance definitely more important in that case. But even then it was a thing to do. Okay, Jen, you wrote some stuff
That's like a bunch of percentage, like 85% of the time off by doing it one way versus the other. And that's when it's like sure it is performance definitely more important in that case. But even then it was a thing to do. Okay, Jen, you wrote some stuff What are we right here? So far I need to put my prescription in here. Hold on. I did not put everything in here yet. So this is where this is where the thing, do me a favor at the top at the top of this at the very very top, the very very very very top
What are we right here? So far I need to put my prescription in here. Hold on. I did not put everything in here yet. So this is where this is where the thing, do me a favor at the top at the top of this at the very very top, the very very very very top Like there, where it says class person go above that. Add some more lines. You're going to need some more lines here. We're just we're going to just make this a little bit easier to read. Import data classes. It's not terribly important that you understand what this is doing
Like there, where it says class person go above that. Add some more lines. You're going to need some more lines here. We're just we're going to just make this a little bit easier to read. Import data classes. It's not terribly important that you understand what this is doing It's just going to make it a lot easier to build multiple people in it. That's the format. So now above class person, you're going to do an at sign ampersand. You're going to do no ampersand something. You're going to do at data classes. Data class. Yeah, we got to get you using those those
It's just going to make it a lot easier to build multiple people in it. That's the format. So now above class person, you're going to do an at sign ampersand. You're going to do no ampersand something. You're going to do at data classes. Data class. Yeah, we got to get you using those those Yeah, there you go. Data class. Yep. Perfect. So now we have to define some type values on this. So eyes is an integer. So you're going to do eyes, colon. You're getting no no no no, go to where it says i's equals to. I use colon. And boom. Yeah, like that. And yeah, perfect. Do me a favor
Yeah, there you go. Data class. Yep. Perfect. So now we have to define some type values on this. So eyes is an integer. So you're going to do eyes, colon. You're getting no no no no, go to where it says i's equals to. I use colon. And boom. Yeah, like that. And yeah, perfect. Do me a favor Do me a favor. Do you have the Python plugin for VS code? Well, we're going to save this really quick. The Python extension. Yes. Let's let's save this first. Just a sec. OK. And it needs to go into the cold field day. And we are going to the lens crafter story. The lifetime series lens crafters
Do me a favor. Do you have the Python plugin for VS code? Well, we're going to save this really quick. The Python extension. Yes. Let's let's save this first. Just a sec. OK. And it needs to go into the cold field day. And we are going to the lens crafter story. The lifetime series lens crafters We're just going to call it glasses glasses. That's fine. Glasses. OK. And then you want it. Wait, wait, don't tell me. Because we went through this. You have some custom icons. Extentions. There you go. I was like, I have to remember. Do you have emoji? All icons. Interesting. OK. It's good
We're just going to call it glasses glasses. That's fine. Glasses. OK. And then you want it. Wait, wait, don't tell me. Because we went through this. You have some custom icons. Extentions. There you go. I was like, I have to remember. Do you have emoji? All icons. Interesting. OK. It's good OK. It's good. What is this one? No, that's fine. No, you don't need that. Oh, the settings. Sorry. The Microsoft person. No, don't install the thing that is in Microsoft, my bad. That's that wasn't my bad. OK, go into settings. Not this settings or a different settings. Just the actual settings
OK. It's good. What is this one? No, that's fine. No, you don't need that. Oh, the settings. Sorry. The Microsoft person. No, don't install the thing that is in Microsoft, my bad. That's that wasn't my bad. OK, go into settings. Not this settings or a different settings. Just the actual settings No, wait, we could do it down here too. There's multiple options. There are settings. Yes, settings option. And then I made a video about this last year. So type in type hints. T-Y-P-E, space hint, H-I-N-T. OK, cool. Now scroll down. Scroll down. Not JavaScript ones. Not TypeScript ones
No, wait, we could do it down here too. There's multiple options. There are settings. Yes, settings option. And then I made a video about this last year. So type in type hints. T-Y-P-E, space hint, H-I-N-T. OK, cool. Now scroll down. Scroll down. Not JavaScript ones. Not TypeScript ones How about some Python? Astero, Python. OK, so here's what we're going to do. No, that's not it either. Just type in space Python after type hint, just so we can see just the there we go. Type in add in later that as well. There's a lot of things here. You're missing some
How about some Python? Astero, Python. OK, so here's what we're going to do. No, that's not it either. Just type in space Python after type hint, just so we can see just the there we go. Type in add in later that as well. There's a lot of things here. You're missing some I like the emoji icons make me happy. I'm making it not as mad at staring at it. Get rid of the phrase type and Python. Get rid of Python and get rid of type. There we go. Change it from on to often less pressed. OK, now go back to your notebook file. Now hold the control and option key
I like the emoji icons make me happy. I'm making it not as mad at staring at it. Get rid of the phrase type and Python. Get rid of Python and get rid of type. There we go. Change it from on to often less pressed. OK, now go back to your notebook file. Now hold the control and option key Control and option key. What? It did not work. It's supposed to work. I wonder if it doesn't work in. It must not work in notebooks. It must not work in notebooks. Done it. Can I show you my screen? OK, it also doesn't mean that it doesn't work for my computer
Control and option key. What? It did not work. It's supposed to work. I wonder if it doesn't work in. It must not work in notebooks. It must not work in notebooks. Done it. Can I show you my screen? OK, it also doesn't mean that it doesn't work for my computer My computer just doesn't like the dish file. So if anything is changed there, it doesn't like it. So I'm curious to see when I get my work laptop. If I have the same issues, if I just like broke it somehow. OK, so I can see what's going on here. If you're in a regular Python file, you can do
My computer just doesn't like the dish file. So if anything is changed there, it doesn't like it. So I'm curious to see when I get my work laptop. If I have the same issues, if I just like broke it somehow. OK, so I can see what's going on here. If you're in a regular Python file, you can do Portated classes. Sorry, I'm cheating. I have. Copilot on. Actually, I'm not even cheating. I have copilot on. I'm just going to say that. Eyes. No, not encoding warning. Ears. No. You don't need a mouth. OK, so now when you have this. By default, we don't have any of this stuff
Portated classes. Sorry, I'm cheating. I have. Copilot on. Actually, I'm not even cheating. I have copilot on. I'm just going to say that. Eyes. No, not encoding warning. Ears. No. You don't need a mouth. OK, so now when you have this. By default, we don't have any of this stuff Actually, we're going to get rid of that too. If we just said eyes equals two. Here's equals two. Knows equals one. Yeah, you're supposed to be able to do that. You're supposed to be able to hold down. Control and option. And it will make them magically appear. The type ends will appear
Actually, we're going to get rid of that too. If we just said eyes equals two. Here's equals two. Knows equals one. Yeah, you're supposed to be able to do that. You're supposed to be able to hold down. Control and option. And it will make them magically appear. The type ends will appear And you can double click them. And it will insert them, which is nice. That's what I was trying to get yours to do. But apparently. We can't have fun things. But also, I wonder if it's because it's a data class. And in order to set up the data class, it had to. It has to have these
And you can double click them. And it will insert them, which is nice. That's what I was trying to get yours to do. But apparently. We can't have fun things. But also, I wonder if it's because it's a data class. And in order to set up the data class, it had to. It has to have these So maybe it was yelling. That yeah, OK, so that's what it was. Do this. OK, so if you're going to get yours. I may or may not have. You're good. I started a Python file just to see if it would make it any better. No, I don't think it will. Go to your notebook. OK, hold on. Hold on
So maybe it was yelling. That yeah, OK, so that's what it was. Do this. OK, so if you're going to get yours. I may or may not have. You're good. I started a Python file just to see if it would make it any better. No, I don't think it will. Go to your notebook. OK, hold on. Hold on Hold on. How do I get back to my notebook? We're going to figure this out. It's. Do this. Use the command panel, the command palette. It's your friend. Hit command P. Okay, there we go. Type in, just type in. That's one. There you go. Okay, there we go
Hold on. How do I get back to my notebook? We're going to figure this out. It's. Do this. Use the command panel, the command palette. It's your friend. Hit command P. Okay, there we go. Type in, just type in. That's one. There you go. Okay, there we go Okay, there we go. That is the hint that I tell everybody, like if you can learn one thing, learn that the command palette exists and it is your friend and you should use it. The only time I use command palette is to, actually I wanna know if I'm using the, oh, I, yeah
Okay, there we go. That is the hint that I tell everybody, like if you can learn one thing, learn that the command palette exists and it is your friend and you should use it. The only time I use command palette is to, actually I wanna know if I'm using the, oh, I, yeah I do the shift command to, so that is the actual like to do an action thing. If you just do command P, it puts you in a file search. So it's the same bar and you can even move it by just adding the greater than sign. We're just removed data class on that top part
I do the shift command to, so that is the actual like to do an action thing. If you just do command P, it puts you in a file search. So it's the same bar and you can even move it by just adding the greater than sign. We're just removed data class on that top part Nope, not that part, not that part go down to right there. Just comment that out. This entire line. Yeah. Now hit command and option. Is it still not doing it? Okay, just delete that line. Because if that doesn't work, then it's a notebooks thing and I wanna report that. Okay, cool
Nope, not that part, not that part go down to right there. Just comment that out. This entire line. Yeah. Now hit command and option. Is it still not doing it? Okay, just delete that line. Because if that doesn't work, then it's a notebooks thing and I wanna report that. Okay, cool Okay, cool. Try it over here really quick. Just copy and paste it. I just have to do the first one, right? Import data classes. You don't even have to do import data classes. Just import, just copy and paste the class. Yep, just that
Okay, cool. Try it over here really quick. Just copy and paste it. I just have to do the first one, right? Import data classes. You don't even have to do import data classes. Just import, just copy and paste the class. Yep, just that Yep, just that. And you're doing, you're doing control and option, right? Or do I say command option? Okay, control and option. Yeah, I think it's a my computer thing. That makes me sad. Because my computer doesn't do a lot of things it's supposed to do
Yep, just that. And you're doing, you're doing control and option, right? Or do I say command option? Okay, control and option. Yeah, I think it's a my computer thing. That makes me sad. Because my computer doesn't do a lot of things it's supposed to do Well, the reason I was checking that, because if that's a bug with notebooks, that's a thing that I can report and then we'll get that figured out. Okay. If y'all are still here, you should try this and let us know if it works for you because it really could be my computer
Well, the reason I was checking that, because if that's a bug with notebooks, that's a thing that I can report and then we'll get that figured out. Okay. If y'all are still here, you should try this and let us know if it works for you because it really could be my computer That's why it's kind of hard to say. So if you use VS code, please try yourself and let us know. All right, I'm going back to my notebook. Yeah. Nope, it looks like it's an issue in data classes. I'm checking it now. All right. So you did your thing, you got your thing here
That's why it's kind of hard to say. So if you use VS code, please try yourself and let us know. All right, I'm going back to my notebook. Yeah. Nope, it looks like it's an issue in data classes. I'm checking it now. All right. So you did your thing, you got your thing here It's, oh, you're going to need to add the data class at the at data class, that data class thing. That's a Boolean B O L. Also, yeah, it looks like NLi Typens do not work in Jupyter notebooks. Need to check with my And I misspell it. I probably misspell it. I'm going to close that. It's just bull
It's, oh, you're going to need to add the data class at the at data class, that data class thing. That's a Boolean B O L. Also, yeah, it looks like NLi Typens do not work in Jupyter notebooks. Need to check with my And I misspell it. I probably misspell it. I'm going to close that. It's just bull It's just bull. It's B O O L. Sorry. You got me. You're typing. I was like, this is not working. I got a string one. I remember it's string. But yeah. And then you need to add, you're rid of the space between the at data classes, dot data class in person. Right there. Yeah. Okay
It's just bull. It's B O O L. Sorry. You got me. You're typing. I was like, this is not working. I got a string one. I remember it's string. But yeah. And then you need to add, you're rid of the space between the at data classes, dot data class in person. Right there. Yeah. Okay Yeah. Okay. So now when you go to person, do you want to go as gen equals person? Go to a new like go in between the parentheses there. And make a new line. Yeah. Now you're going to just do needs prescription equals true. Oh, so instead of these things. Yeah
Yeah. Okay. So now when you go to person, do you want to go as gen equals person? Go to a new like go in between the parentheses there. And make a new line. Yeah. Now you're going to just do needs prescription equals true. Oh, so instead of these things. Yeah Yeah. Just going to copy and paste all this and then change it. That's not really going to work like that. Oh, yeah, because it has the end. Yeah. Yeah. And also what we did is we set some defaults there
Yeah. Just going to copy and paste all this and then change it. That's not really going to work like that. Oh, yeah, because it has the end. Yeah. Yeah. And also what we did is we set some defaults there So if you don't set it, you only need to change the things that you're going to actually change, which is why we built this as a class to begin with. And I just want to say the entire reason that this makes sense. What you're talking about right now is I've been working on learning types. Grants
So if you don't set it, you only need to change the things that you're going to actually change, which is why we built this as a class to begin with. And I just want to say the entire reason that this makes sense. What you're talking about right now is I've been working on learning types. Grants Grants. They're very similar. Yeah. Because of my type system. Yeah. And if you tell that to someone who uses Python, they might get upset with you because of course, type hints are polarizing thing in the Python community because in type hints, the types actually are enforceable
Grants. They're very similar. Yeah. Because of my type system. Yeah. And if you tell that to someone who uses Python, they might get upset with you because of course, type hints are polarizing thing in the Python community because in type hints, the types actually are enforceable Like if you put the wrong value, then it's going to do some ugly like stuff. It's going to be like, Hey, no, you can't do that. And Python, the type hints are mostly just so that editors like VS code can understand how to work with code
Like if you put the wrong value, then it's going to do some ugly like stuff. It's going to be like, Hey, no, you can't do that. And Python, the type hints are mostly just so that editors like VS code can understand how to work with code And also for the user, which to me is the most important thing. But then also like data classes is like one of the one of a few exceptions where that is like an enforceable thing. I, I will say it's because though like learning them side by side that it does make more sense now as for
And also for the user, which to me is the most important thing. But then also like data classes is like one of the one of a few exceptions where that is like an enforceable thing. I, I will say it's because though like learning them side by side that it does make more sense now as for Like enforcing the type system. And if it's going to be like strict type script, for example, I like cobra. Hem the idea. I haven't done it yet though. Striking is here is my super spicy take. Strict typing is the devil. Like it is. All right
Like enforcing the type system. And if it's going to be like strict type script, for example, I like cobra. Hem the idea. I haven't done it yet though. Striking is here is my super spicy take. Strict typing is the devil. Like it is. All right All right. So like if you mentioned, I types are better in type script than in Python. I strongly disagree because I think so Python has this philosophy of duck typing. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck
All right. So like if you mentioned, I types are better in type script than in Python. I strongly disagree because I think so Python has this philosophy of duck typing. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck I think that yes, in most cases, you want to be explicit in your typing, but type script takes it to like way overboard. Type script is like if you have a dictionary and you haven't assigned that dictionary to a thing and you haven't typed that dictionary out to be that thing
I think that yes, in most cases, you want to be explicit in your typing, but type script takes it to like way overboard. Type script is like if you have a dictionary and you haven't assigned that dictionary to a thing and you haven't typed that dictionary out to be that thing And if you haven't pinpointed what each of those individual dictionary values have to be, then I'm going to yield an error. Or you do what Alta has just mentioned in the chat
And if you haven't pinpointed what each of those individual dictionary values have to be, then I'm going to yield an error. Or you do what Alta has just mentioned in the chat You cheat and you say I'm going to type everything is any which if you're going to do that, what's the point in type hinting. But that's actually so when and I'm paraphrasing so like do not hold Josh this because I could also be misunderstanding
You cheat and you say I'm going to type everything is any which if you're going to do that, what's the point in type hinting. But that's actually so when and I'm paraphrasing so like do not hold Josh this because I could also be misunderstanding But that was actually a question that was asked on Josh's stream Josh Goldberg. He wrote this book, looting type script
But that was actually a question that was asked on Josh's stream Josh Goldberg. He wrote this book, looting type script These are the two books I'm leaning from that moment and Josh is coming on this dream is somebody actually specifically asked and he said, well, if you're not sure what types you're using and like the way you want to set it up, start with any and then go and change it
These are the two books I'm leaning from that moment and Josh is coming on this dream is somebody actually specifically asked and he said, well, if you're not sure what types you're using and like the way you want to set it up, start with any and then go and change it So that way it's across you to stop and start throughout the entire thing and getting stuff on that. And it might mind that totally made sense because I was just like, okay, cool. Once you're further along in your project, then it'll help you set up for success
So that way it's across you to stop and start throughout the entire thing and getting stuff on that. And it might mind that totally made sense because I was just like, okay, cool. Once you're further along in your project, then it'll help you set up for success But if you're just starting a project that could be the death of everything as you just mentioned. So here's here's my alternate idea
But if you're just starting a project that could be the death of everything as you just mentioned. So here's here's my alternate idea Type it with what you know it will be typed as unless it truly will be anything unless it truly can handle anything in which I have some code questions about that because I feel like that's where security vulnerabilities happen or also performance issues
Type it with what you know it will be typed as unless it truly will be anything unless it truly can handle anything in which I have some code questions about that because I feel like that's where security vulnerabilities happen or also performance issues So, and this is y'all just because I just went through the types systems like area. This is now has so many questions here. So the types that are these the same in, I guess I should Google y'all we're going to go to Google really quick. Hold on. I'm going to go. Yeah
So, and this is y'all just because I just went through the types systems like area. This is now has so many questions here. So the types that are these the same in, I guess I should Google y'all we're going to go to Google really quick. Hold on. I'm going to go. Yeah Yeah. Any any is when you are handling things that you do not know what you are going to be handling. And even then I argue that I think that you want to create an interface. And you want to make sure you pass that interface in
Yeah. Any any is when you are handling things that you do not know what you are going to be handling. And even then I argue that I think that you want to create an interface. And you want to make sure you pass that interface in And then if that interface is like something that you is beyond your control, then you you at least know that it is a reference to that interface
And then if that interface is like something that you is beyond your control, then you you at least know that it is a reference to that interface And that's that's where so this is the thing the reason I'm passionate about this is I've been building my own static site generator for the last three years
And that's that's where so this is the thing the reason I'm passionate about this is I've been building my own static site generator for the last three years And the thing that is interesting about this is that I've been working as it's been like my long term project is a way to stay fresh and Python continue to provide modernization ideas and to have a playground to try these things. And recently I started adding the ability to create plugins for it
And the thing that is interesting about this is that I've been working as it's been like my long term project is a way to stay fresh and Python continue to provide modernization ideas and to have a playground to try these things. And recently I started adding the ability to create plugins for it And the thing that broke me was that because I didn't type my stuff and I was assuming that I was always going to be working with text. I have completely bricked the plugin system because one of my plugins works with a dictionary and not with a string
And the thing that broke me was that because I didn't type my stuff and I was assuming that I was always going to be working with text. I have completely bricked the plugin system because one of my plugins works with a dictionary and not with a string And sure I could string to find that dictionary and then add a bunch of unnecessary logic in or I could have just type hinted everything and said this is expecting this type you're going to run into this issue
And sure I could string to find that dictionary and then add a bunch of unnecessary logic in or I could have just type hinted everything and said this is expecting this type you're going to run into this issue So like this idea of adding this really small feature set has taken like now two months to implement because of bad typing and and bad like initial design. So that's why when when people are like oh just give it the type of any and then keep it moving like that's great
So like this idea of adding this really small feature set has taken like now two months to implement because of bad typing and and bad like initial design. So that's why when when people are like oh just give it the type of any and then keep it moving like that's great Until three years later you're like why in the hell did I do this because now I'm fighting with my previous self because of decisions that I made
Until three years later you're like why in the hell did I do this because now I'm fighting with my previous self because of decisions that I made I'm going to go with I have no idea like I understood what you just said, but I don't know enough about the two and it would be interesting to have you and and Josh on just to talk about types systems because I think that is like I'm looking further in the
I'm going to go with I have no idea like I understood what you just said, but I don't know enough about the two and it would be interesting to have you and and Josh on just to talk about types systems because I think that is like I'm looking further in the Okay, between you all can't see all the things i'm holding i'm really all the books all the books and the website so in typescript or JavaScript I should say they have types of null undefined bullion string number big and and symbol which Josh told me even the last you don't really get used to sell he's like but you got a list of i'm like okay cool
Okay, between you all can't see all the things i'm holding i'm really all the books all the books and the website so in typescript or JavaScript I should say they have types of null undefined bullion string number big and and symbol which Josh told me even the last you don't really get used to sell he's like but you got a list of i'm like okay cool Like this one we have the Python data types i'm like okay cool so we got safe safe this you know we have data types cool but I don't even know where in the book it talks about data types and automate the boring stuff and i'm wondering a is it worthwhile to explain in the beginning or is it something that people learn data types and Python later on
Like this one we have the Python data types i'm like okay cool so we got safe safe this you know we have data types cool but I don't even know where in the book it talks about data types and automate the boring stuff and i'm wondering a is it worthwhile to explain in the beginning or is it something that people learn data types and Python later on Data types or type hunting is a thing that has not existed for very long so it's probably just not in here like magic yes but my argument is type there was a there was a riff there was a there was an infinity war or I guess the Civil War if we're talking about the Marvel movie universe Marvel Cinematic Universe or whatever
Data types or type hunting is a thing that has not existed for very long so it's probably just not in here like magic yes but my argument is type there was a there was a riff there was a there was an infinity war or I guess the Civil War if we're talking about the Marvel movie universe Marvel Cinematic Universe or whatever And in the Civil War there was like this thing if we really want type inning type inning is going to be great we should totally do type inning and then there were half the people were like but no Python is a duct type language we don't need type inning type inning is is going to be the death of Python as we know it
And in the Civil War there was like this thing if we really want type inning type inning is going to be great we should totally do type inning and then there were half the people were like but no Python is a duct type language we don't need type inning type inning is is going to be the death of Python as we know it And what eventually happened. Yes and what we're talking about we're talking about type hinting or type annotations not necessarily data types
And what eventually happened. Yes and what we're talking about we're talking about type hinting or type annotations not necessarily data types I think Jen understands the concept of like this is an integer this is a float this is a Boolean value like what those different values are and what they look like yes we're talking about the express annotation of these objects
I think Jen understands the concept of like this is an integer this is a float this is a Boolean value like what those different values are and what they look like yes we're talking about the express annotation of these objects It's I just learned last week in typescript yeah I'm very excited about this because it was a chapter in type systems so this is this is where I'm I'm I'm amongst of those people that says
It's I just learned last week in typescript yeah I'm very excited about this because it was a chapter in type systems so this is this is where I'm I'm I'm amongst of those people that says If you truly don't know what the type is leave it blank until you know and keep it moving I do agree with that assigning any is a declaration that this can handle absolutely anything and the reason I say leave it blank instead of giving it any is that if you're using a tool like VS code
If you truly don't know what the type is leave it blank until you know and keep it moving I do agree with that assigning any is a declaration that this can handle absolutely anything and the reason I say leave it blank instead of giving it any is that if you're using a tool like VS code And you're in the situation where like I reached out to my team and they said that it should work but it obviously isn't working so maybe this is a bug. If you're using a tool like VS code you can keep writing the code and then go back and ask what types have been used in this you have to go
And you're in the situation where like I reached out to my team and they said that it should work but it obviously isn't working so maybe this is a bug. If you're using a tool like VS code you can keep writing the code and then go back and ask what types have been used in this you have to go Yeah I totally 90% sure that I have my psychiatrist right now snap yeah go do that. And I'm three minutes late. That's okay. This is great this has been fun. This has been fun and yeah it totally started three minutes ago so I'm going to drop goodbye everyone
Yeah I totally 90% sure that I have my psychiatrist right now snap yeah go do that. And I'm three minutes late. That's okay. This is great this has been fun. This has been fun and yeah it totally started three minutes ago so I'm going to drop goodbye everyone And if you want to stay on for a minute finish that thought you're welcome. Yeah it's fine. Okay if people are interested just follow me on Twitter or something and then ask me and we'll figure it out. Yes follow me on Twitch. Get to your appointment get to your appointment it's more important
And if you want to stay on for a minute finish that thought you're welcome. Yeah it's fine. Okay if people are interested just follow me on Twitter or something and then ask me and we'll figure it out. Yes follow me on Twitch. Get to your appointment get to your appointment it's more important Thank you all bye. KJAY Miller at everything. GitHub LinkedIn all of those things even YouTube. KJAY Miller that is the thing. All right I'm going to okay she left it she left it right so I'm going to finish my statement here
Thank you all bye. KJAY Miller at everything. GitHub LinkedIn all of those things even YouTube. KJAY Miller that is the thing. All right I'm going to okay she left it she left it right so I'm going to finish my statement here If you're using VS code and you write a bunch of code you can use type hints to then go back and apply the actual types that you're using.
If you're using VS code and you write a bunch of code you can use type hints to then go back and apply the actual types that you're using.
