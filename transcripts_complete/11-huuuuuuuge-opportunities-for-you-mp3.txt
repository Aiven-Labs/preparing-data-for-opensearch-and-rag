From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. From Relay FM, this is Conduit, where we are all muddling around somehow to get through the day. This week's episode is sponsored by Pingdom. I'm your host, Kathy. And I'm Jay, because this has been too long since we've recorded, and I feel like we're doing a great job, but we just need to be reminded. So I'm here reminding us, Kathy, we're doing a great job. Let's keep going. Thank goodness, because, wow, yeah, it's been it's been. You know, we did an episode where we talked about, like, coming back from vacation, but that was just like a couple states trip that you did. And I went to the beach. I changed multiple time zones. At one point, you were in the future. I was in the future and it was very strange. And it's been more than a week since I've been home and I'm still not still not quite adjusted. But I think part of that might also have to do with the fact that there was a little holiday called Thanksgiving and that also, like, really threw off my week. So basically, I am a mess and a disaster, but I'm here and I'm so happy to talk to my friend, Jay. I mean, even if we've recorded a show before, like all of our shows are relevant, they're not like time bound, which is great because sometimes we need those reminders ourselves of like, how do I get back into the swing of things? And if you're wondering how to do that, check out episode six of Conduit. But let's let's jump into some shout outs because I am excited for mine, but you have to go first. So. Well, good, because I am also excited for mine. I want to give a major huge shout out to Jason Denzel, who chose me to be his partner in crime for our trip to London. And it is the whole reason that I was able to go to London to attend the blue carpet premiere of The Wheel of Time, the new Amazon. Is that like carbon on the new television show on Amazon Prime Video? If you want some more information about our trip or any any of that, you can go to dragon mount dot com. That's dragon and mount, as in the animal and a mountain without the AIN dot com. Or just click a link in the show notes. But we had an incredible time and I was so honored to be a part of everything that happened. And I but I'm also happy to be back. I'm happy that you're back. And I'm also like still excited because I've I've never known. Well, at least I don't think I've known anyone that's done like any color of carpet. Uh, so it's it's cool to be, you know, I'm sure at some point now I'm even closer to Kevin Bacon than I was before. And to me, that's just insane. And I'm super stoked for you. I'm super happy about, you know, some of the new stuff that you're doing. And we're going to talk about that later. Um, but I'm also happy that I've completed the trifecta of ATM people that I've talked to. And ATM is for Above the Mess, our sibling friendly show that talks about productivity and creativity and all the amazing things that make lives and being productive messy. I've spoken to Rose before, see my other podcasts and things for that in the past. I've spoken with wonderful friend of the show, Maddie, before, but I had never spoken with Izzy, comrade Izzy, who was actually what I wanted to was taking a break from social media. And I wanted to respect that. But they have since come back from their break. And now I was able to ping them. And we talked for like a good hour and just kind of got to know each other, got to know like we're both in tech and kind of have been around the tech space for a little bit. So it was really cool to have a great conversation with a new friend. And a shout out to you, Izzy. And then I know I didn't put this in the dock because I'm a rebel. You know, you leave me to go away and I come back a totally different person. But huge shout out to Scotty of the show for subbing in for me and making the most incredible episode of Conduit. How big was that huge? Huge. You know, it's huge when Zoom cuts you out. Yeah, yeah, that that that tracks. Thank you, Scotty, for being so incredibly vulnerable and open and sharing everything that you're going through. And I am so honored that you chose our show to be able to talk about that. And yesterday, as we record this yesterday. So today is November 30th. We recorded yesterday was my husband's 11th stroke aversary. So he had had his massive stroke 11 years ago, which means I completely understand from a caregiver side of things, this this journey of trying to figure out what is normal and how to make adjustments as things are constantly changing. And you don't know what the future brings and you don't know. Just basically, it's all really scary. And I just want you to know how proud I am of you and your family. And I'm here if you need anyone to talk to. Yeah, that was kind of the challenge. And, you know, when when the topic came up, there was a lot of like, but, you know, we're like tangential to the pain like we've we've been in this experience. My mom and my grandmother both have lupus. And like, there's the situation of like, there are times where, you know, myself or like my younger sister have had to like carrier upstairs because of the pain. Like we were definitely like right there next to it. We see some of it, but it's really hard to equate that to being the person and the feelings of being the person. And honestly, like I said, Scotty tried to call me right before we started recording and it like threw a wrench and all this stuff. And like like we talk that much like we text each other every day. And like we have these conversations and there were still things that I didn't know. And I didn't fully grasp exactly how much or how much of what Scotty was going through. So, I mean, again, Scotty, thank you so much for being a wonderful substitute and coming onto the show and being so open and vulnerable about what's going on in your life. And also, we didn't say it enough. And actually, Scotty mentioned this on Twitter as well. Shout out to his family who has had to adjust with him. And I know that that's always a challenge. And that side, I can definitely empathize with more and understand, you know, some of what they're going through, but it doesn't make it any easier. So a big shout out to them. And I hope that recoveries and good feelings all around. That said, Scotty, you know why I'm saying this. Why don't you just go for a skate? Does that's why I love the shows, because we can actually make very specific references to people like, hey, blue sky dragon of the show. Good luck on your finals. I know you can't do it, but we're going to get into that later. Yes. Don't we have another shout out? Shout out to the holiday season, y'all. Happy solstices of things. The solstices of things. Holidays of the show. It is. We have a gift for you. So but of course, we're going to wrap it up and put it under the tree. Stick it in a shoe outside your door. I don't know what that holiday is. Yeah. All sorts of holiday events. Something you have a gift coming to you. But if you want to sneak peek, make sure to join the relay.fm discord. Now, Jay, how would someone do that if they wanted to be a part of the discord and the amazing group of people that we call our conductors? Well, it's quite simple. The first you go to relay.fm slash conduit, and then there's going to be some buttons up there for you to join and support the show. And if you do that, then you get an invite to the discord. And then from there, you can choose your faction. Are you going to be a system and themer or are you going to be a break room of chaos and oh, sorry, too much, too much, too much. I got to bring it back. They're back. Come on. We're not scaring people away. We want people to come and play with us. Yes. And also this just in from the relay.fm. You can actually now give the gift of membership to people. So if you have thought, you know what? My partner or my friend really loves those relay.fm shows. And they're listening to this in the car right now. And I'm hearing about this for the first time. Maybe you can go to relay.fm and gift a membership for the holiday season. And you can do it for a month. You can do it for a year. You can do it for however you wish. But give the gift so that they can receive the gift that we have for all of our conductors and all of our amazing people in the relay.fm community. Yes. So stay tuned. Check out the discord for a special announcement, and then we will announce it to the public on our episode that comes out after this one. I think it's time to check those connections. Connection check. Zap. So my connection was working on my intentionality and making active choices. And when I was making those choices, being actively involved in what I was doing. I'm marking this as kind of like a yellow flag, orange flag. What do we talk about? Middle stoplight. Basically, I feel like I worked on it. It was not perfect, which if you have listened to the show before, you know, that like that's normal. And so I'm you know what? I'm changing this. I'm making it green because I did it some points. I'm never going to be perfect. And I need to like really own the fact that I did work on it. It's just like meditation. You know, when you meditate and a good person who is leading that meditation, who might say, you know, these thoughts are going to come in and make adjustments and affect your like mindset or what you're thinking or what you're doing. And it's OK, though, that's totally normal. Let it come in, acknowledge it and let it pass. And so I obviously was not perfect and would never be perfect and cannot expect myself to be perfect. And as such, I'm saying that my connection check was successful because I did it. First of all, I love that you changed literally the color of the status for those that don't know. Here's the inside scoop on what we do. We have a document and we color code our connections based on how we did. And I literally watched to go from orange to green. I was like, wow, that is that is a very metaphorical feeling happening right there as as through the process of talking through it, you like like, you know, I did can't do it. And I love that. I'm also going to throw out there. I made a snippet this week for, you know, why see Di for you condit it. And that is also that's the nerdiest thing that I got to do. And I'm totally stoked about it. But also, Kathy, I remember someone in our discord, I believe it was that looked up the definition of what perfect is. And it's quite literally as good as it could possibly be. And that doesn't mean that just because you didn't do it didn't mean that you didn't do it perfectly. Like you doing it to the best of your ability meant that you did it perfectly. So all right. I'll accept that. Thank you. That is so awesome. My connection was pretty simple. Coffee and artificial sun. First thing in the morning, I'm going to I'm going to say I struggled with this as the days got longer. I did do a good job at the beginning, like the first week. I'll also say I had to do this longer than I usually would for a connection because we recorded a little early. So there was a good two weeks where I was like on point. And, you know, I think more than anything, this was like a learning lesson. So I'm OK leaving it as yellow. But I did notice that one artificial sunlight. Or also known as a vitamin D supplement and coffee before I start working has me more prepared and also gives me time to like wake up and think about like how I'm going to do my day before I just start jumping in and then letting things kind of just happen as they happen. And I mean, I'm definitely going to try to keep doing it. I can't promise that I'll always get it right. But you know what? That that's fine. I would rather at least know that this helps me some and kind of go from there. I think that means that you did it perfectly. OK, I'm going to do a blue check just because I can. Sorry, I don't sometimes I want to be a little silly. And I love our silly banter shots fired. I missed it. I must say, I definitely missed it. You know what I didn't miss? All of the different connections from our conductors. This had an absolute awesome connection checks from our conductors. One from an unexpected zap of the show, Scotty Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, connection. Connection. Maybe maybe tomorrow. And there's a reference there between the Jackson and maybe tomorrow, which is now my daughter's favorite song. Anyway, Scotty says, I worked purposefully, scheduling recreation and fun activities into my day that I would commit to not 100 percent successful, but more than 80 percent. And I really enjoy the reward that deliberate time and planned breaks off for me in my day. I I really like that. That's so good. So good. Plan your breaks. Plan your time to do nothing. Let yourself acknowledge the fact that breaks are good and breaks are important and breaks are healthy. And if you schedule them in, then, you know, you can't miss out on that date with yourself. Absolutely. Like we've talked about my love of Tetris and like how I even have certain times of the day where it's like it's Tetris time and I'm going to go do that. And I know it's Tetris time is actually the name of a player who plays Tetris. So if you're listening to this, I doubt you are. But if you are, hi. What about the next connection? Yeah, our next connection comes from Dave Rails of the show, who says that while he did prepare to start writing device already, he didn't actually start that project is on hold for now. Here's the thing is I am so proud of you for marking it as like partially done. So instead of a complete failure, they put it as a an orange square, yellow square. What is color? And basically, that is incredible because you didn't allow yourself to think of yourself as like failing this this connection. You're like, hey, you got it started. And that is great because that will mean the barrier for entry to come back to it is smaller because you know what the setup looks like. And so I can't wait to hear about what you've written. I love the idea of putting something on hold and having it again, marked down, be intentional about it. But at the same time, the one fear that I always have is the idea of some someday, maybe like if you have it on hold, the only advice I can give Dave is to also specify when you want to come back to it, even if that means like I'm going to do this next month or in six months or next year for NaNoWriMo or something like that. Like if you give it a specific time, it doesn't have that feeling of like, oh, I'll get to it when I have time like that. I hate someday, maybe because of that. It's like someday maybe means probably maybe not. And then also, I think it's important to find out maybe why you didn't start the writing. Was it overwhelmed with a blank page? And if so, then just start, you know, brain dumping and just or pulling the closest book that you have and start just typing up the words from the book next to you, something to get in the process. And then you can start putting your own words into into play. Or is it you ran out of time because you were setting things up? Well, then it's already set up so you can do it again. Trying to figure out kind of what was blocking you can can help the progress of that connection and that idea and goal of what you're doing. This will be the second time I've said this in two episodes. I really wish there was a way to get more information from some of the people that submit these. And I really hope we can figure out a good way to do that. I do, too. That would be really incredible. If you have any ideas for us, let us know. Absolutely. Blue Dragon of the show, Sky. Hi, Sky. My connection for the next two weeks is to survive the finals. I've already talked about this. I know you can do it. You will survive. Also, shout out to their show, Find My Dragon, because they they talked a lot about this in the last episode. And as someone who did not finish college or barely even started it, I don't know that feeling. And I can only imagine what you're going through. But I do hope the best. And I'm glad that your first year was really enjoyable. Yes. Next connection comes from a friend of the show, Maddie. I have partially visualized my theme in my planner. I have a page in my planner that was that my goals, but I find my eye isn't caught by it. So I need to try something else. Going to use the next fortnight for that rework. I love that she put again the yellow circle, orange circle, a tentative thing. However, I think it was a successful one because you did it just because it isn't the way that it needed to work. Doesn't mean that this connection to visualize your theme was not the right way to do it. So I would argue that you should have a green checkmark, but you are valid in the choice that you made. Yeah. And and again, I like that we don't have any red like I just totally blew this off, didn't do it completely crashed and burned. Like everything has been pretty good, including a green one from our wonderful friend, Bell's, our else be else. Our Australian of the show. Yeah, our friend of the show from Down Under. They didn't fill out the form. I'm trying. I have a form that says all of these different things. Sorry, I'm not making this about that. Anyway, green checkmark. I did apply for the job. I got good experience interviewing. I was rusty. I totally have been there. I didn't get it in the end, but that's OK because it wasn't for me. That's the right mindset. I love this. This week, I need to decide between two opportunities at my current job that even better, thankfully, now I know this great method now, but thankfully, I now know this great method to help make in making that decision. Are you talking about the tire method? Tire method. Are you going to look at your time, intuition, resources and energy to make a great decision? I love this so much, especially, you know, just because something doesn't happen the way that you thought or what not being able to acknowledge the good pieces that come out of it, you know, learning about your interviewing skills and practicing on that and then possibly moving again. Oh, my gosh. You poor thing. I know that in the end, you're going to make a good decision. And it sounds like you're in a position now where you're like, I feel like in the end, it's all going to be good. So I'm excited for you. And I can't wait to hear more about that.

So I was actually going to say, I was excited to hear about your new project, but the sponsor works too. But please, please fill people in on this project that you've been doing that got you into London. I want to know more because apparently it's been happening for a minute and I just found out. I mean, that's OK. You are very busy working on this. That's OK. You are very busy. We're all very busy. And that's the hard part about me doing so many different things is that I never want to bother somebody who doesn't want to know what's going on. Every so often, I think, oh, I should, you know, share out everything that I do more often, but that's really exhausting. So instead, let me just tell you about it right now. So for the last couple of years, I have been working with a website called DragAmount.com and kind of helping grow and streamline their social media presence and their content creation and kind of producing everything behind the scenes and helping some great content be created. And so when Amazon contacted them, inviting Jason, the founder of Drag Amount, to London and saying, hey, we know you have a big team. You can take somebody with you to go to London to be a part of the premiere and an incredible experience. He picked me. And so we got to go and have this absolutely incredible experience. I can't even explain how wonderful it was. Obviously, there are things that I wish I had done better, because any time you do anything new, there's always going to be mental expectations that don't get met. But it was still such an incredible experience getting to be on the red carpet that was actually blue, getting to run around the Tower of London in a costume with my hair done by the same person who does one of the actors hairs every time that he is in London. Having a party on the top of Tower Bridge, just an incredible amount of experiences that I cannot even believe actually happened. And then that wasn't even it. That was just the branded Amazon side of things. Like I was able to then extend the trip and we stayed for another like six days. And I got to hang out with so many of my incredible friends. Got to see Rosemary. I got to hang out with Serenity Caldwell. I got to hang out with Adina and Mike. And we did some amazing things that I just like. It was the best week of my life. So there is there's a topic that I don't think we've talked about too much. And this is why I have FOMO. This is like for those that don't know, Kathy and I had long conversations about when we were going to do a show together, like Jay was doing a lot. I think at the time when we first started talking about the show, I had like six projects that I was working on. And Kathy was like, you're doing way too much. There's no way we can focus on this. And I was like, you know what? This project is so much more important than all of the other ones. I'm going to shut everything else down. Do as I say, not as I do. But see, here's the thing is that like I go. My brain doesn't work very well if I only am on one topic or concentration. I'm sure that's probably an indicator of ADHD tendencies that I probably should get checked out working on it. But in that time period that I was gone, I also launched a new podcast that I'd been working on for about a year. Because, of course, I have been lucky enough to get the first six episodes of the television show The Wheel of Time that came out on Amazon Prime. And we got to do podcasts about it. So, yeah, there's six episodes of this show that are live on The Incomparable that you can find at the incomparable.com slash dragon mount, where I talk about this television show with two friends and how excited I am. And just this the Wheel of Time is something that has been a part of my life for 20 years and getting getting to talk about it and getting to have it exist outside of my circle of friends is really, really special. It's the reason that my husband and I met when our child was born. We named them after a character from the books. Like all of these things have had a huge impact on my life. And it's kind of now coming to fruition in a way that I never even imagined it would get to be. And so when it comes to taking things out of my schedule in order to make this happen, it was a no brainer. But it's also it's also helping me redefine what my boundaries are and what to say no at no for. And when I can say no, but still do the things that I really, really, really want to be a part of. Yeah. And I should clarify, I'm not by any means admonishing Kathy for chasing her dream and literally traveling across the world. I'm doing stuff. Yeah. No, not at all. It was it's just funny that I think that there is a like you said, there's a line, there's a boundary that like you have to navigate and you have to kind of understand how to navigate it. A good example is I have a YouTube channel and, you know, I'm not a YouTuber. I'm not I mean, I have like 400 people that follow me. Hopefully the few more after they hear this go check the show notes, whatever. But, you know, at the at the end of it, it's I don't make content for growth. Like I don't I don't do the goofy gags that everyone has become used to. In fact, sometimes I play to the exact opposite of it. And like I talk about things that inspire me and things that I really like and I enjoy because I know that for me and I've talked about this on other things, my knowledge of YouTube and my knowledge of making video and knowing how to edit video, even with podcasting, knowing audio and how to edit audio has gotten me plenty of opportunities. I have one client in my little side business that I do that I've had for several years and just working on this newsletter for like 30 minutes a week every week for the last few years. Got me on a podcast where I got to talk to the lead singer and frontman of Weezer, which is like super awesome. Mind blowing and amazing. Like I never imagined that I would have an opportunity to be on a show with Rivers Cuomo and just being like, seeing how much of a nerd he is and being able to like just nerd out about music and and programming and stuff. But those opportunities only come because of the things that we make space for. And as much as, you know, Kathy, for good reason, got on to me of like, hey, I think you're doing too much. We need to make decisions on what, you know, what we can give up and what we can't give up to make this work. I think there's also room to have discussions about like when you let things in. And I mean, I will I'll be real, like there are projects that I want to do that as I'm looking at it, it's like, I don't know if I have the time for this. And again, it's it's using that patented brought to you by Conduit, the podcast that teaches you all the productivity things, that tire method of just saying like, hey, you know, as much as I have the energy for this, I don't have the time or as much as in my head. Everything seems like it makes sense. But there's this little intuition bug that's like, you might want to rethink that. Like I have to be able to make space to listen to that and judge each new opportunity based on that merit, but also not be afraid to say, you know, hey, let's give it a shot. And even if it means like doing a small thing for a limited amount of time, like that's perfectly fine, too. 100 percent. I think it's important, especially for people that are multipotential lights or who can't not necessarily can't concentrate on one thing at a time, but get really bored mentally and emotionally and physically if they're only spending a ton of time on one topic, being able to turn around and and find out where it's OK to say yes. But the biggest biggest problem that occurs is when people are choosing to just say yes to everything without putting thought into it. And that's when you can get overwhelmed. That's when you can get really frustrated because you're not able to do anything at its full potential. And so I think it's important to be able to learn what things you feel so passionate about that you can turn around and say, yes. And I think that there's also ways that you can, you know, talking about multipotentialism and that mindset, people know my favorite book is How to Be Everything, the guide for people that still don't know what they want to be when they grow up by Emily Wapnick. And one of the things that they talk about there is having space for the things that are important to you, but not having those things be the definition of what you are, nor them being necessarily your job. And, you know, for me, if I took all of my passions, I would be a professional bowler slash Tetris player who also builds apps in his spare time and podcasts and shoots videos all day. But that means I wouldn't have time to do all of the great work that I do as a developer advocate and working with like underrepresented groups in tech and and focusing on community as well. Like all of these things have different values to me so that I'm able to weigh them out whenever I do have to make a decision about a new project. Hey, if I take on this new project, actually, that's something that I've thought about recently, too, of like, hey, if I take on a new project, what does that mean for my Tetris time? But one of the things my wife and I talk about a lot now that my daughter's getting older is what happens when they decide that they want to do things like Girl Scouts or join a bowling league and especially that one, because I want to be a part of that. I want to help out with that. Or if they want to play a sport like all of these different things, I want to be able to make time for and I have to evaluate where these things exist in my life. Yeah, being a part of my kids dance career, maybe. So they they dance 10 hours a week with an additional three hours of like assisting classes. And that's a lot of time. And they're old enough. And I mean, obviously, I I am not dancing with them and dropping them off to class, but it includes competitions. It includes, you know, experiences. We have a parade that we're performing in this weekend. And as part of the studio, I take the photos for all of these dancers and I get to be a part of the community that's involved in the studio. And I have to say no to some things and learn what's important to say yes to and be able to make the adjustments to my life and my schedule to do these things that I think are really important. We also have a competition that the older girls are going to. And I'm we also have a competition this weekend that the older dancers are going to be competing at for championships. And I am so happy to be able to go and take pictures of them. But again, that takes up my Saturday. And I'm 100 percent OK with that, because this is something that I love to do that fills my cup in a way that pays back the time, effort and energy that I'm putting into it, as well as knowing that they have the opportunity to receive these photos the last time that this team will be competing. And that's really special. And I didn't use the tire method at that point, because obviously I did this a while ago. But I will say that I have used it to continue to make the specific choices of. Is this what I want to do? Yes. Yes, it is. I think you can also look at using something like the tire method for recurring, like, do I still want to do this thing? And I'm sure people are like, why is this episode? This episode took a turn. Everyone was super jovial. Like, we're still good. Welcome to real life. Yeah. Every everything here is great. Conduit is like there. There are no plans to my knowledge of of conduit changing or anything like that. Oh, gosh, no, this is. Yeah. Sorry, you're stuck with us. We love you. Yeah. Please, please keep listening. But like the the idea of that means in order for conduit to continue to be a priority, that means we have to make the decision on what things we can sacrifice and what things we can't. And that is something that as a lot of the conductors kind of mentioned, that idea of not necessarily intentionality, but also like having it defined, like, hey, if I have to put this project on hold, I'm going to put the project on hold for the next six months so that I can wrap up some other things and make space for this new thing to happen. Or, hey, I have two opportunities. Maybe I think about which one is great for me now and look at how that's going to affect me in the future and make choices based on that. Or maybe I do nothing for right now until I have more space to do a better job at whatever it is I want to do. And I think that that's something that we often ignore. And like there's a there's a saying of like from a podcaster that I know called Justin Robert Young that talks about politics and saying like, like all politics is local politics. Like it's local for somebody even at like a grand stage. And it's like all productivity is like future productivity, the productivity that you think about now and the decision that you make now have some effect on what's happening in the future. And if you don't consider that your your gauge for your tire, your tire pressure, if you will, might actually be lower or higher than what you're really believing that it is. Yeah, 100 percent. And then also, it's important to when you do say end up saying yes to something that you don't feel guilt because you have to say no to something else. Or that, oh, gosh, you say you said yes. And basically just own not own your choices, because that makes it like almost sound like a bad thing. But but being able to, you know, sit with the choices that you make. And yes, you can make adjustments as need be. But but learning how you react to things and how you work through things and what the best way to make these adjustments is. And see, I liked it with the idea of owning it, because, I mean, obviously, we know that there are times when Jay goes into full ratchet mode, see episode. What we're not going to do is I think that there's a way that you can verbalize the decisions that you've made and the decisions that you've not made, because it gives you it gives you power. Like if if imagine telling someone, no, I'm not going to do something. And their immediate response is, oh, but why or why not? Where you can say, because of my current commitments, I I love this idea and I wish I had more time. But these other things are currently preventing me from being able to take this on. Or, hey, I would really love to do this. But right now, I'm wrapping up this other thing. Perhaps we can revisit this in a few months. That sounds so much better than just, I really can't right now. Like that means, OK, well, when could you never someday? Maybe like again, I really hate someday, maybe for this exact reason, because it's so vague and like I need to know like when, if if not, if not now, when I think that's an Incubus album. I'm sure it probably is. I definitely know those things. Well, one thing I know is I I feel like I've given myself a connection for this upcoming episode or this next episode that we're going to be doing. But Kathy, I don't know. You get to go first. Well, no, no, I just wanted to thank you for coming back, because I know like after you got onto the red carpet and stuff, I'm sure there were so many people that were like, hey, I would love it for you to like come visit the red carpet for my show and do a podcast for my thing. I'm totally glad that you turned them all down so that you could do this silly little show with me. Hey, you know, I had already said yes to you. So I got to make space to say no to other people. I love it. But speaking of connections, my connection for this next fortnight is going to be to put a timeline on something. Like I said, I don't even know what it is, but I'm I'm certain that I have a bunch of stuff happening right now. I know that I have more things happening, but I want to make sure that I have a timeline on things so that if something needs to slip, I can say, hey, I'm going to let this slip after this day or, hey, I'm going to revisit this other idea on this day. And I think that will help me make a better decision in the future. I love that. So my connection is kind of. Now, I'm just going to. So I'm going to work on talking about all the things that I do. So not just when something new comes out, but not be afraid to state how many different things that I am participating in. I don't keep it a secret by any means, but I also have a sense of not wanting to bother people. So I'm going to quote unquote bother people by letting them know about all the cool things that I do. Like a podcast that I that just got published, the the finale of a three part series of a D&D campaign on Total Party Kill called Murder on the Eberron Express, which is one of the most incredible things that I think I've ever done on a podcast. Sorry, Jay. But the ending, the finale was so epic that if you have a few hours to listen to a quote unquote one shot, even though like it takes place over three podcast episodes, I'd highly recommend you listen to this. I totally forgive you because it's D&D related and that's OK. You can make time for D&D. So thank you also, listeners, for listening to this episode. And thank you to Pingdom for sponsoring Conduit and this episode. Hey, Jay, did we can do it? Well, you know, I would love to say we did conduit. But after looking at all of the things that we thought about and wanting to put a realistic timeline on, no, we totally condid it.
