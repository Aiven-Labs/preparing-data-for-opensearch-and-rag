From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, where Betty White, Dame Judi Dench, and Flo sit in a room and look at stains. This episode is brought to you by Issue. I'm your host Jay and with me is the unicorn with the screaming goats. And probably the creepiest gif I've ever seen in my life is Kathy Campbell. What's up, Kathy? Hi Jay! If you want to know... Go ahead, I'm sorry. No, I was going to do what you did, but it's your show so you do it. Okay, if you want to know what all of that means, because I'm sure people are like, wait What just happened? What? Before these words. We record this show live every fortnight on Discord and you can join us, become a superconductor and hang out in the chat and be exposed to some of our behind the scenes shenanigans. If you want to experience this fun, but you can't join us live, then you can use our special superconductor feed that you get with your membership. You'll also receive an email with the link to our off week co-working session. We named a bunch of microscopes and we got to see the conduit strain. I'm not really sure. The conduit strain, don't worry, you won't have to quarantine for it. But visit I'm a Superconductor to become a member today to get access to our pre and post show banter, an ad free episode and the co-working session with Kathy and Jay. Let us know what you think of this video. Let us know what you think of this video. Let us know what you think of this video. Let us know what you think of this video. Let us know what you think of this video. Let us know what you think of this video. Let us know what you think of this video. Let us know what you think of this video. Let us know what you think of this video. And Kathy, are you wearing any special conduit merch today? And Kathy, are you wearing any special conduit merch today? Always. My green zip up conduit logo hoodie is my magical sit on my work chair for when I get slightly cold hoodie. And I am wearing it right now. And it looks very, very nice, I must say. It makes me happy as well. And if you want to get your green zip up hoodie or something else at Yukonwear.com. Kathy? Kathy? Jay? Jay? Jay? Num num num num num. It's time for feedback. Wow. I love that Logan or Logang as Jay puts it said that, yes, you're right. I am pacing the room as well and would like to let Jay know that they love how enthusiastic Jay is about Logang. So that's fantastic. Even if it's incorrect, it's wrong, but it's fun. I have no idea what you're talking about. What about our connection check? Zap. OK, I like the energy. Yeah, good. Because that's that's about it. I put a yellow heart on my connection check for this past fortnight because mine was to do my morning pages and I did them, but not every day. And I am giving myself forgiveness. However, as we will talk about later, it's something that helps so much. And I really need to do it more often. What about you, Jay? You just reminded me to take my vitamin D supplement. Oh, good. Do it. That wasn't my connection, but my connection was to have a difficult conversation. I had that conversation the same day I did it. I was I was going to come up with a new connection and I was like, you know what? No, it took me a lot to do it right then and there to rip the bandaid off. And now I got to enjoy a week of knowing that I did the most difficult thing. First, some people like to call that eating a frog and I'm like, yo, frog legs are good. However, don't eat a live one. That's just kind of weird. I really wish we could get away from some of these weird analogies for productivity hacks. It's just kind of it's just it's just a weird thing. Yeah, like there's a there's a someone somewhere. I don't remember where I saw it from is like for filling their time, they do, you know, put the big rocks in first and then the medium rocks and then you can fill the rest of the space with the little rocks. But that doesn't necessarily help you with picking what to do first. And also there's another idea of doing the fun thing or the good thing or the thing that you enjoy first instead of the bad so that you get to enjoy it and embrace it. I don't know how I feel, but I feel like that might be a connection, a conversation and a topic that we do in the future. I think that's definitely a topic because I have a different opinion where I like to sprinkle my fun in like you would put sprinkles on your ice cream. So, yes, yeah, like that to me, if ice cream is the thing that you got to do, the sprinkles on top are the thing that you do for fun. But of course ice cream is fun, too. So I think in all things, just make it fun. Right. As much as you can, knowing that there are less fun things to do. But yeah, like gelato. I enjoy gelato. I actually enjoy gelato, too. Even if it's in the bad place. Yeah. Yeah. What about our conductors? What would they do? Our conductors were very busy this past fortnight. Our soprano of the show says connection check, green checkmark, finished the baby quilt for my friends and mailed it to them. It arrived last Monday and then the baby was born two days later. Perfect timing. You should be very proud. That's awesome. Congratulations to the new family. I guess the growing family. They've been a family. Yeah. Are they already parents, though? Congratulations on the new addition. Our civil engineer of the show, Dan says, green circle. I got back into the rhythm of planning my work, using my task manager more effectively and I can see a light at the end of the tunnel with my revision and study work. Congratulations. Our favorite panda of the show, James says connection check, green checkmark, slowly got on with things and at least tried to take breaks when necessary. So I'm going to call that a win. You could also climb a mountain in VR, but I'm not as sure that counts as an achievement. Well, yes, it does count as an achievement because you shared it with us. And also, I know for a fact, and I'm so proud of you that you stopped a project at 90 percent because I know in the past you would have just been, oh, I'm super close. I'll just finish it. And the fact that you didn't, I'm so proud of you, James. Why are you talking about me like that? Our mountain dweller of the show, la la la la la la. And then we have a question from the fan. It says, yellow circle. After I sent my connection, I had to spend six hours in the mud patching a water main related emergency. Yeah, that left me completely out of spoons for a few days, then catching up at work took priority. So I still have four cabinets to go along with the drawers. Oh, man. Look, I'm sorry. That's that's rough. And I am I am dreading this. I'm sorry. I am not. I'm sorry for making you feel like I'm going to have to get on a little like fix my shower thing and we still have to put the tile back on? No, it has not happened yet. So I'm right there with you. So many priorities that come before, but you got this. All right. Our oracle of the show, Sof says connection check red square. this is entirely my own fault, trying again for the next connection. You know, acknowledging the fact that it, like trying to figure out why you wanna do it and also realizing that you haven't had a break in 15 days, it's definitely time for you to take a break. You deserve it. But also everyone deserves a break. Our train enthusiast of the show, Railsie, says, orange circle, what? Okay, okay, come on. We're really messing me up here with the color coordinating. Orange circle, whatever that means. I didn't do any of this, so I'm going to move it to this conduit. My schedule has emptied up after leaving a second job. I ended, don't worry, I ended the contract. Two jobs is not a good idea. You know, that's- Yes. Wow, yes, yes, yes, yes. We're gonna talk about that, I guess, a little bit more later today. So yes, congratulations on making those decisions and also knowing when to push things down the road. Absolutely. It's a good thing that I have this next one because our blue dragon of the show, Sky, says connection tech. Why is it blue? Blue heart. In the last two weeks, I hit what may have been the peak of my school and work-related anxiety, but since then I've come down from that hill and have some new tools to help deal with it. It's almost like he knew what we were, it's almost like they knew what we were gonna talk about this episode. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron, says, "'Don't recall my last connection, I've been there.' Or, if it was checked on a previous episode. So I'll just assume that I conned it. Yes, yes, yes, optimism for the win. Right there, you absolutely conned it, I love it. All right, Robert, the nameless of the show, says, "'Connection check, lemon, yellow, lemon.' I fixed my sleeping habits, but this came as a result of having to be in the office for the last conduit. Thus, I have not been able to test if this habit will survive when I'm at home again. So for now, I give myself a yellow lemon because when life gives you lemons, I love it.'" That is such a good mindset and having this balance, testing it in a place where you have to go into the office is a great way to set the foundation of that habit. And then it hopefully will be easier when you come back home. Also in a totally unrelated thing, Kathy, as we're recording this, the night before, my daughter and I made homemade lemonade. Aw. Straight like with lemons and sugar and ice and water. And it wasn't bad. For a first time making lemons, not bad at all. I think we got a recipe that we need to tweak a little bit. Needs more lemon. But yeah, when life gives you lemons, I was immediately like, hey, we did make lemonade. And finally, who's that Pokemon? It's Mudkip. The Mudkip of the show, Nadia, says, "'Connection check, red devil. Didn't get anything on track. Still just skating by with all my work, but at least spring break is next week. Can't think of a new connection yet because I realized I had to do this just now.'" Oh, well. I forgot to erase that, sorry. That's okay. Mistakes were made, but that's okay. Because you know what? You got a break coming up. And I think the best thing that you can do is not think about your next connection and just take a break. Yes, absolutely.

I'm sorry, I thought it was an error. No, no, put it back, put it back. It's back, it's back. I thought it was someone like hitting the keyboard. Wow. I'm sorry. So last week I said that instead of just saying thanks, I was going to broaden my horizons and pick a random language from Google Translate. This week it's Miso and I'm going to say, Lam tu can sa wi e.

Now that the Super Bowl is over and now that spring training hasn't started, what season are you in and what you got coming up? Oh my goodness. All right, so March, April, like the spring season is always intense. So, and not just in the tent-like arena and space, but. I was gonna say it was future tense until it's present tense and then it's past tense. Wow, wow. That was even worse, thanks. So one of my clients is a CPA, which means tax season is busy season. It's also competition season. My kid has comps pretty much every weekend. And also the big convention that I am on in one of the groups to support is in April, which means here in March, it's a month before, it's time to get busy and paying attention and all of the things. And that's a lot, like even each of them just by themselves, it would be a lot. But the fact that all three hit at about the same time and I never seem to learn to be ready for it. So the beginning of it means that I'm usually like stressed and overwhelmed when it all starts to come down. Now, if I was more of a professional and a planner, I would know that, hey, this is gonna happen and be able to do something about it. But I haven't. Yeah, no, okay. First of all. I've been jarred. Yes, you have. And I was going to say, look, being a professional means absolutely nothing other than you get paid to do a thing, which by all means you are a professional. And sometimes you don't even have to get paid to be a professional. So you are indeed a professional. That being said, thinking like a professional is boring. Why can't we just have fun with it? And I have a plan because for me, we are starting what I call the season of madness. If there was a theme for anything that was happening in this time of year, conference season starts usually in the spring, starting around March or April. For me, that is literally as we are recording tomorrow, as I drive two and a half hours north for my first conference of the year. And then it continues on until October. So between April and October, it's madness. And I thought of another madness that starts in March that is one of my favorite times of the year. And that's college basketball season, AKA the March madness. Yeah. And I also thought about what just recently happened in the National Football League, which was the NFL Combine because now that the Super Bowl is over, we are now what's in the off season. And you know, Kathy, I was like, what if we treated our lives as off season, pre season, season, in all of these super stressful moments? What if we fought overwhelm with sports references? And I really want to like break this down for what's happening for you. So you've got competition for cheering and everything else coming up, right? Dance, but yes. You're right, dance. I am sorry. How dare you? How dare I? But with that, there are so many things that you have to prepare for in order to make sure that people are where they need to be. You've got the schedule up and going, you know who's gonna be in what competition, you know what kind of shots that you're gonna try to take this year. What if you blocked it out? And trust me, this is coming from someone who does not do time blocking whatsoever. But what if you blocked it out in many ways like they do with the NFL off season? And I can explain this a little bit more for those that are not very sports. Yeah, clearly I understand exactly what you're saying, but I want to make sure that our audience is aware of what's going on. So I'd love if you could further elaborate on what the heck you mean. Okay, so in the off season, what you first wind up getting is all of the announcements for upcoming contract negotiations and who's going to move teams and all this other stuff. Also, this is a time where people who have been running into each other at high speeds and we're still not entirely sure how that affects people's brain capacities yet. Oh, we're pretty sure. But nobody's talking about it. Exactly. This is a time where many of them take a nice, I would kind of say well-deserved vacation. So the first thing, get your mental health right. Before, like when the season is over, you got that big vacation coming up. Also, right before the preseason starts, they probably take another vacation because you're going to need it. You're going to need to prepare for what's about to happen. Right. So then you have what's called the NFL Combine. And this is when you take a look at all of the new incoming talent that's going to be coming into the league and you get them trying things and they run and they jump and they do a bunch of stuff. And in my mind, I'm sitting here thinking like, okay, this could be a time where you're really getting to know, you kind of know if you've done a lot of photography of existing team members, you know where they're going to be talented. You're going to even know how they want to improve. But you don't know some of the newer faces. So take that extra time to just learn about them and do that even with yourself. Again, there's a whole bunch of administrative stuff happening behind the scenes. So you've got this whole like, oh, I need to figure out, I might need a new camera or, oh, I want to try working with this new, like this photo technique. So maybe I'm going to do some stuff on TikTok just to see if I can get the poses right or get the stuff right. And maybe you can get Tiny Soup to help with that. And then you have the draft. And the draft is where you are making decisions. Like that is, you've looked, you've done the research, you've done all these things. Now it's time to make decisions. This is where we're going to go. This is what we're going to do. These are the people, these are the shots that we're going to try to take. Here's really the attitude or the focus that we're going to try and take our team. And then the preseason begins. And this is where, this is when competition starts, but it hasn't really started. And then that leads into the season. What do you think? Okay, I mean, I get what you're saying. However, for example, this competition season, it isn't necessarily about the overwhelm of planning so much as the overwhelm of the time that it takes. For example, this weekend is completely, not useless necessarily, but because the competition is so far away, we're going down Friday night and leaving Sunday. And it's going to be all day on Saturday. And then when I get home, because there are about, I think this time there will be about 20 dances. That's a lot of images. And I have it streamlined fairly well. Like it does not take nearly as long as it should, but it does still take time. I need to do it. Like that's energy and effort that takes into it. And I love to do it. I enjoy doing it. It's great. I know what I need to do, especially most of these dances. I have seen, so I know when the moments are, I know what I haven't captured before. That's all fine. It's mainly because it's one more busy thing on top of the others. So this is kind of the second area of this nice long sports reference that we're working with. Have you noticed that it's rare for leagues to run around the same time? Like the important moments of those seasons always seem to be not during, or like at the beginning of the other season. Because I think of this as like the Super Bowl just happened, then becomes the NCAA playoffs, then becomes the NBA championship. At the start of spring training for baseball. And then when the World Series convenes, we're like week one into the NFL season again. So this is where I feel like pacing really helps. Because our lives aren't like, we're not monoliths. We're not just, you're a business unicorn. You are a photographer. You are all of these things. Our chat is like, oh, so this thing, the advice is going to be don't do everything all at once and I feel attacked. You're not wrong. That is, yes, I'm not attacking, but yes, that is going to be some of the advice. But I think the challenge in this is to intentionally space out when you're doing things. And this is a thing that I've been trying to work on more in my professional life, where as I'm doing conferences, what I want to do is reduce the amount of long form content that I'm creating and move down to doing smaller, shorter bits of production. So more YouTube shorts, less 10, 15 minute videos and absolutely zero courses. But the only way I can do that is take those ideas and push them into the off season when, or like the current off season, when I know that there will be more attention to be given to those things. Because what I'm hearing, Kathy, is you're saying like, I'm excited to do all these things, but what I'm not excited for is the fact that I have to do all of these things in addition to all of the things that I was already doing. Yeah, yeah, I think it's, it's, I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that there's a lot that I cannot control. There are a lot of pieces involved in this and I don't have, like, sorry, I cannot get the government to change tax season. Tax season around, yeah. Yeah. But what I had, and I also am not a, a time blocker type person, but I am starting to think that I might need to do at least some basic time blocking, specifically for things that I know will take, will need to happen and need to get done. So for example, the photos, editing, well, for example, on Sunday this week, I did the annual photo shoot for the high school dance team in celebration of their state end of year big competition with their costumes and it was super fun, so great, but it's gonna take a lot more editing than just the action shots that I normally do. And I have a timeline for that, but I can't just sit and get them done because other things need to happen too. So what I think I'm going to be doing is kind of some basic time blocking for these types of situations where I have projects that everything needs to get done, everything's a priority. It's fine, I'm just tired. I absolutely get that and kind of like you said, there are just gonna be some things that you can't move and that's where, are there other things that you can move? I actually had to do that recently where someone wanted me to do a presentation and I was like, not until June, like I will be more than happy to present this in June. And I do think that there is often that, not speaking directly to Kathy here, but there are often things that what we're afraid of is if we say not now, that means no. And one, words have meanings, so if the answer is not now, the answer is not no, this is a thing I have to tell my child that I should be telling myself that are like, oh, not now isn't a bad thing unless you use it in a way that means not ever, but not now is often a way to give the thing, the amount of attention that it deserves. And I really do hope that, this elongated sports metaphor serves more than anything as a way to, again, check your tire pressure and say like, how many other sports do I have happening right now? Do I really wanna start another one? Do I really wanna participate in another thing? And I mean, this was a thing that happened recently in a local community thing that I'm a part of, they were like, hey, can we count you in to do this like once a month? And I was like, no, no, you can't because I don't know when I'm gonna be in town and when I'm not gonna be in town and it's better for me to tell you that I'm available between these months and not available during these months so that I can give that thing full attention, I can give it all of my energy, but if you have to have an answer today, then the answer will be no, but what I would like to tell you is not right now. Yeah, yeah, and I know that I need to say no or not now more often, however, it's really hard. Instead of saying, you know that you need to say no, say you yes that you need to say no. Okay, I guess that I need to say no. Oh, I mean, it's like a mindset thing. Oh, I know that I need to say no. Well, okay, if you know, then, no, yes, I need to say no. Give yourself the, and again, this isn't me talking to Kathy directly. I don't want people to get the, this isn't a smile more moment, please. It's that moment of, it's not toxic positivity, it's not ignoring the other things that you're responsible for. In many ways, it's like the spoons conversation we had with Scotty. If you only have this many spoons, regardless of whether you really, really, really wanna do it or you really, really, really, like you don't want to say no to the thing, your spoons will say no for you. And it's better to push down the road. And I wouldn't even say push it to an absolutely down the road, but push it to a let's check back in in this time. When I said no to the thing that I was supposed to say no to in my connection, this past conduit, it wasn't a I don't ever wanna do this. It was here are the things that are on my plate right now. I would really love it when these things are off my plate, which will be around this time, if we can talk about this again. And that to me is rephrasing the not right now to be a I respect what you're trying to do and I want it to be as good as possible. And I can't do that for you in this moment. And that doesn't mean that you can't prepare for it. You can't do the, I think we talked about this in the pre-show where you were talking about the weird productivity analogy of you have the jar and you put in the big rocks and then you put in the little rocks and then you put in the tiny pebbles of sand, which in my mind, it's like, stop putting stuff in the jar. That's the fix. It's not throw a bunch of tiny things in there. It's like, look at how much stuff is in your jar. And if it's half empty, that isn't an excuse to add more things. It's an excuse to get a smaller jar. That way it's full. Wow, that is, that hits real. Yeah, that's, yeah, that's right. It's, I think it's also difficult though to remember that this isn't forever. Like this busy season will end one way or the other. And right now I need a bigger jar because I have so many rocks that need to get done, but I can switch out the smaller jar in the future. Ooh, that's good. I like that. I like that. We went from a sports metaphor to like a canning metaphor. Which let's be honest is way better because I understand it. Okay, okay. Have you seen these, there's a, I guess, I think it's a TikToker at this point that is like, I have this jar that I've preserved for like 30 years that's like a living pickle situation going on. And it talks about like taking care of that jar. And I look at that in that kind of like our tire analogy there, but there's a lot of things that they do or that the creator does with the jar that includes like water sealing it so that little things can't get added. There's a lot of just liquid in that jar. It's not completely packed with pickles, which again, not necessarily one of those things that you gotta think about too deeply there. But on top of that, there is a maintenance phase. There's like, oh, what if the coloration of the jar starts to change over time? Well, that's an indicator that something has happened where we need to then purge the system and get all that stuff out and go back and fix it. Yeah. Yeah. I am speechless because it's right. Like these visualizations can seem silly. These visualizations can seem silly. Sometimes if you are just hearing it or I don't know, there's a tick, a sticker about it or something. But for me, it really helps remind myself to think about it, if that makes sense, because I will be reminded about it more often when I need to think about it. Yeah. I totally think that you're right. The jar metaphor is just so much better than the sports one. I mean, less CT involved. We started out good. And then we worked it, we practiced it. And then at the big game, we made adjustments in the- Oh dear. In the moment, right? Because the best plan is the one that succeeds regardless of what plan you had ahead of time, right? I think- Oh yes, I called an audible. I think I have a good connection to this. Eventually the stuff in the jar will be ready. And that's when you pour it into your Super Bowl. Nice. Speaking of connections, what's your connection going to be in the next conduit? The next conduit is going to bring me some time to loosely time block. So I am gonna have to work a few more hours a week, which is okay, because I'm going to put the time in where it needs to happen, knowing that I get to change to a different jar later. And so I'm going to attempt to time block is going to be my connection. What about you, Jay? Ooh, the time blocking one is fun. I don't think I can do that. I am terrible at time blocking. I am thinking about this. So here comes a live connection with Jay. I'm gonna be out of town. Again, I mentioned traveling. I think my goal for another goal, goal sports anyway, I'm going to challenge myself to continue to not say yes right now. And basically prevent myself from accepting anything new for this conduit. And my hope is that this will be an ongoing thing where I say nothing new until actually, ooh, better. Yeah, yeah, okay, cool. Yeah, we did it, we did it, we did it. Ask me again, Kathy. Ask me the question again. Oh no, we're keeping this all in. Oh no, that's fine, ask it anyway. Okay, okay, what's your connection, Jay? I am going to set the season. I am going to say that season starts from this time and it ends at this time and nothing new can come in during that time. Ooh, that's a good one. Excellent. And I do have to think about that because I think I know all the conferences that I'm going to this year, but I need to also check and I also need to make sure that I leave in an off season for myself to decompress from all the stuff that took place over like the six month period. So good, well done. All right, what about our conductors? Yeah, Deborah, our soprano of the show, her next connection is to work on feature planning for my team's summer software release. Look at that planning in a season, nailed it. Our civil engineer of the show, Dan, says, planning my tasks has left me with a bit of spare time to explore new interests. Coding, JavaScript coding. I'm completely new to it, but enjoying learning something new, I want to try to do five hours a week of learning it. You can do it, Dan. I'm fighting the urge to be like, no, smaller jar, smaller jar. But I think if that's a thing that, if you can use that to keep your jar small and not fill it with five other things, then absolutely you can do it. Our panda of the show, James, his connection is, try and remember to do something to celebrate Pi Day on the 14th. And by celebrate, I really mean do some marketing. I can't wait to see what Pascal is going to eat. First, I was like, wait, what is the language doing? Ain't no mountain dweller high of the show, ain't no valley low gang, got it, yes. I may be foolish, but I feel good about house progress. So I'm going to be sure to hang out, yes, with or call friends more often because it always re-energizes me. Yes, that's what I'm talking about. Got a little bit of air in the jar and decided to use that as an opportunity to catch up with friends, yes. Yes, so proud. Our oracle of the show, So says, actually going to take a day off each week, maybe even two. Yes, do do do do do. Yes, so. Breaks, breaks, breaks, breaks. That's what you say when you're about to get into a wreck. Breaks, breaks. Oh no. Our train enthusiast of the show, Railzi, who would probably also yell breaks, finish last conduits connection check and keep up my Duolingo streak, back to learning Welsh. Should Welsh be the next thing that I learned to say thank you in? I think you do need to do it. Okay, there we go. All right, our blue dragon of the show, Skylar, says new connections, spring break is next week, one task, relax. Yeah, break time. Break time. Wow, this is the time of breaks, I love it. The identical twin of the show, Aaron, says, need to be more mindful about the kinds of snacks that I have, goal is to ensure that I have at least a few days over each week where I either just have fruits or nuts. Additionally, I need to try on my suit and determine if I need to get a new one as I have a couple of weddings coming up in the spring. That sounds like a fun time to hang out, but also yes, fruits, dried fruits, even better, roasted nuts, also really good. Nom nom nom nom nom. The nameless of the show, Robert's new connection is to maintain the sleeping habits I was forced back into. Hopefully being back home does not mean going back to old habits. Start tracking my habit streaks. I want to build healthy habits for my life, but I need to have a baseline to see where I am starting from. Yeah, you can do all of the habits you want, but if you don't know what you want and you don't know how you're doing, it won't be as helpful as one can think. So I love that you're gonna start tracking that and see where it goes. You gotta know what you want, what you really, really want. Wow. Wow. And our mudkip of the show, Nadia says, can't think of a new connection yet because I realized I had to do this just now. That's okay, you already said it before, spring breaky time. That means more time for breaks, breaks, breaks, breaks. Breaks, breaks, breaks. If you would like to submit your own connection, maybe you wanna take a break, you can also do this in the Relay Discord in the hashtag show follow-up channel by starting your message with the conduit emoji and putting your connection after.
