Hello, hello beautiful humans. Random stream time because I needed more time to figure out this project. I really want to build this web app app thing and I'm not 100% sure where to start, but I figure streaming it I'll be able to keep it from my information and be it'll just help in the long run, you know, like why not? So the goal is to create a something that I can tell people to enter in their Twitter needs. I think it'll just be easier to show you. Give me a moment. Okay. Good, my profile
I'll be able to keep it from my information and be it'll just help in the long run, you know, like why not? So the goal is to create a something that I can tell people to enter in their Twitter needs. I think it'll just be easier to show you. Give me a moment. Okay. Good, my profile Good, my profile. Only two eaters. Easy, sit. And I'm still looking. Give me a second. Ha ha. Right. So every week, I need to share my screen to be able to show you what I do every week. All right. So what I'm trying to solve for today is every week I create my Twitter space
Good, my profile. Only two eaters. Easy, sit. And I'm still looking. Give me a second. Ha ha. Right. So every week, I need to share my screen to be able to show you what I do every week. All right. So what I'm trying to solve for today is every week I create my Twitter space And then I ask everyone, please share so that the reminder it's literally the same tweet. I copy and paste it. And then I copy and paste all of everybody's Twitter's names so they get tacked. And it's a hassle because I have to time and forget to do it
And then I ask everyone, please share so that the reminder it's literally the same tweet. I copy and paste it. And then I copy and paste all of everybody's Twitter's names so they get tacked. And it's a hassle because I have to time and forget to do it Yes, I could go into like buffer or something and like sign up like have an auto post, but I don't want to do that because then people can't like remove themselves or just like auto add people. Maybe I could do that if I did like Zapier from a Google forum
Yes, I could go into like buffer or something and like sign up like have an auto post, but I don't want to do that because then people can't like remove themselves or just like auto add people. Maybe I could do that if I did like Zapier from a Google forum I have done something kind of similar with Monday.com. But I basically want to be able to create the Twitter space, paste it into this app. And then it create the rest of this for me and allow people to fill in a form to get added to this list
I have done something kind of similar with Monday.com. But I basically want to be able to create the Twitter space, paste it into this app. And then it create the rest of this for me and allow people to fill in a form to get added to this list And it knows if I have more than the character limit, it'll tag the person in the next one. I feel like this is a very ambitious, but I really want to make it. So that is what I'm going to be working on. Oh, yeah. Ta-da. Okay
And it knows if I have more than the character limit, it'll tag the person in the next one. I feel like this is a very ambitious, but I really want to make it. So that is what I'm going to be working on. Oh, yeah. Ta-da. Okay Ta-da. Okay. So we are going through the bear basics to start with of I am going to be creating a read me and all of that and be able to create this and get hub and I need to remember all of the things to be able to create. And get hub. So please bear with me while I Google Google all the things
Ta-da. Okay. So we are going through the bear basics to start with of I am going to be creating a read me and all of that and be able to create this and get hub and I need to remember all of the things to be able to create. And get hub. So please bear with me while I Google Google all the things I guess I could Google over here too. Hmm. CLI create. Get. Rebo. That works. Well, it's enough right? I feel like it is. And also, and as you know, we're going along with this today, feel free to ask questions or, you know, be able to give suggestions
I guess I could Google over here too. Hmm. CLI create. Get. Rebo. That works. Well, it's enough right? I feel like it is. And also, and as you know, we're going along with this today, feel free to ask questions or, you know, be able to give suggestions This is something that I'm doing for live learning because I really want to get this done. Again, like open to suggestions. Yeah. I also say, just kidding. I'm going to awkwardly struggle through this. Oh, I almost forgot to feed the duck. The music. Yes. I don't want to. Let have ripped
This is something that I'm doing for live learning because I really want to get this done. Again, like open to suggestions. Yeah. I also say, just kidding. I'm going to awkwardly struggle through this. Oh, I almost forgot to feed the duck. The music. Yes. I don't want to. Let have ripped Let have ripped. We lay down for I don't see anything. I don't really install like a hub CLI but again we're gonna find out. We want to create a new one. We want to call them this Twitter space ads maybe. Description. Wow. Users, user enter. We got our handbook. We will be added
Let have ripped. We lay down for I don't see anything. I don't really install like a hub CLI but again we're gonna find out. We want to create a new one. We want to call them this Twitter space ads maybe. Description. Wow. Users, user enter. We got our handbook. We will be added We will be added. We will be housed for a Twitter space notification. Wow. So one. I am curious like what are you all up to like anything fun today? So I'm actually really excited to be able to get this done. I have no idea how long it's going to take. Because I'm starting from scratch. Feel
We will be added. We will be housed for a Twitter space notification. Wow. So one. I am curious like what are you all up to like anything fun today? So I'm actually really excited to be able to get this done. I have no idea how long it's going to take. Because I'm starting from scratch. Feel Feel. We do. lawn fairly space. Face. To. I'm not gonna do that. We're gonna do that. I'm not gonna do that. Here. This is gonna be public. Uh, yes. We need that really high. You're gonna say yes. Um, yes. We want the MIT. Let me see with you. No, no, no, no. Yes, I want the MIT
Feel. We do. lawn fairly space. Face. To. I'm not gonna do that. We're gonna do that. I'm not gonna do that. Here. This is gonna be public. Uh, yes. We need that really high. You're gonna say yes. Um, yes. We want the MIT. Let me see with you. No, no, no, no. Yes, I want the MIT Let me see with you. Okay. Yes. We want to go in the locally. Yay. Okay. So we need to go to CD or let's see. CD. Yes. I hit tab so that way at auto field. That is something that. I'm good in this. Eddie taught me when he was on the stream about that the tab can let you allow you to auto fill
Let me see with you. Okay. Yes. We want to go in the locally. Yay. Okay. So we need to go to CD or let's see. CD. Yes. I hit tab so that way at auto field. That is something that. I'm good in this. Eddie taught me when he was on the stream about that the tab can let you allow you to auto fill To your space tab. And then we're gonna go code. Enter. All right. Let's find out what a VS code does not like me to do this. I feel like I had it working and now it doesn't work again because I can hit enter. It's all old. I do this new thing. I don't know. I don't know. So. I'm not sure. Hmm
To your space tab. And then we're gonna go code. Enter. All right. Let's find out what a VS code does not like me to do this. I feel like I had it working and now it doesn't work again because I can hit enter. It's all old. I do this new thing. I don't know. I don't know. So. I'm not sure. Hmm I'm not sure. Hmm. Hmm. Yes. What up Frank tab. I have this happiness. Oh. So I think to get this started. I need to verify that. A bit of the Twitter API. A bit of a react app. I don't even know if this is going to work. So. I'm going to pause with the project. And create a mirror board
I'm not sure. Hmm. Hmm. Yes. What up Frank tab. I have this happiness. Oh. So I think to get this started. I need to verify that. A bit of the Twitter API. A bit of a react app. I don't even know if this is going to work. So. I'm going to pause with the project. And create a mirror board Just something visuals that way I can do. This is what I'm trying to do. And also be able to take notes for myself of this works. This did it work and the visualization of a more. So. What are you up to today? Tonight afternoon evening. Frank. I don't even know what time zone anybody's in
Just something visuals that way I can do. This is what I'm trying to do. And also be able to take notes for myself of this works. This did it work and the visualization of a more. So. What are you up to today? Tonight afternoon evening. Frank. I don't even know what time zone anybody's in It could be middle of the night for all I know. Okay. All right. All right. So again, like, mirror is just a way of visually seeing things. I'm pretty sure a lot of people have compared. Like compared mirror to figma, but it's like non as detailed as figma
It could be middle of the night for all I know. Okay. All right. All right. So again, like, mirror is just a way of visually seeing things. I'm pretty sure a lot of people have compared. Like compared mirror to figma, but it's like non as detailed as figma If I were to talk about mirror, I would maybe compare. Mirror is like, canva is to do Photoshop. And mirror is to figma, which is kind of weird because didn't Adobe buy out. The figma. It's a little weird, little weird. Same. Anyway, so
If I were to talk about mirror, I would maybe compare. Mirror is like, canva is to do Photoshop. And mirror is to figma, which is kind of weird because didn't Adobe buy out. The figma. It's a little weird, little weird. Same. Anyway, so Same. Anyway, so. I truly get that what part of the world are you in, Frank? I'm in. I'm in. I always tried to include like UTC, which is I think. Four hours after Eastern. So yeah, like plus to is UTC. I should actually look this up on them. So UTC is what London. Stop. Okay
Same. Anyway, so. I truly get that what part of the world are you in, Frank? I'm in. I'm in. I always tried to include like UTC, which is I think. Four hours after Eastern. So yeah, like plus to is UTC. I should actually look this up on them. So UTC is what London. Stop. Okay Stop. Okay. And then your plus two. So you're in this blanket. Which when I was spending time in Europe, I mean goodness. This was like four years ago now. I was going to like, alone and then to Bulgaria, then to London
Stop. Okay. And then your plus two. So you're in this blanket. Which when I was spending time in Europe, I mean goodness. This was like four years ago now. I was going to like, alone and then to Bulgaria, then to London And I get that it's only like two hour difference between like London and Bulgaria. But it would always like, so bad. It's such a small continent. How am I getting so mixed up? Well, thanks for hanging out for a bit. Yes, go ahead. Sleep is important. Okay. Okay. I want
And I get that it's only like two hour difference between like London and Bulgaria. But it would always like, so bad. It's such a small continent. How am I getting so mixed up? Well, thanks for hanging out for a bit. Yes, go ahead. Sleep is important. Okay. Okay. I want Okay. Okay. I want. Yes, time zones are so weird. Luckily, I haven't dealt with too much of like dealing with time zones and having to update it within apps. But I mean, I might have to with this. I'm going to put the result to is. Oh. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm
Okay. Okay. I want. Yes, time zones are so weird. Luckily, I haven't dealt with too much of like dealing with time zones and having to update it within apps. But I mean, I might have to with this. I'm going to put the result to is. Oh. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. And hello, hello, everybody joining us. This is me working through a giant project that I really want to work on figuring out
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. And hello, hello, everybody joining us. This is me working through a giant project that I really want to work on figuring out I don't know if it's going to be possible. I'm writing out currently like what I want it to. I'm going to be working through seeing if it's going to be possible with the technology that I'm going to be trying to use. And then actually try and build it
I don't know if it's going to be possible. I'm writing out currently like what I want it to. I'm going to be working through seeing if it's going to be possible with the technology that I'm going to be trying to use. And then actually try and build it And then I'm going to be working through seeing if it's going to be possible with the technology that I'm going to be trying to use. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I feel like this is me actually listening from Leo trying to teach me Twitter, Twitter spaces teach me data models
And then I'm going to be working through seeing if it's going to be possible with the technology that I'm going to be trying to use. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I feel like this is me actually listening from Leo trying to teach me Twitter, Twitter spaces teach me data models Who knows though who knows. And I know that social media apps may be able to do this, but I literally just want to enter the Twitter space information. Hmm. What up Ryan. How is it going? I'm enjoying seeing if I can stumble through all of this. It's going to be so much fun
Who knows though who knows. And I know that social media apps may be able to do this, but I literally just want to enter the Twitter space information. Hmm. What up Ryan. How is it going? I'm enjoying seeing if I can stumble through all of this. It's going to be so much fun I'm trying to make a new app and I don't know if it's going to work. And at all. I'm going to write. I am excited actually. I don't know if that was sarcastic, but I actually am excited. I want to. Yeah, I think I'm just like nervous. About. I will explain it and show it to you here shortly
I'm trying to make a new app and I don't know if it's going to work. And at all. I'm going to write. I am excited actually. I don't know if that was sarcastic, but I actually am excited. I want to. Yeah, I think I'm just like nervous. About. I will explain it and show it to you here shortly Let's see. All right, so on Wednesday I host this Twitter space and what ends up happening. What ends up happening is every week I have to create the Twitter space information and then create all of these tags. And then I have to go look at some BPM to me or if I have a form. Thank you
Let's see. All right, so on Wednesday I host this Twitter space and what ends up happening. What ends up happening is every week I have to create the Twitter space information and then create all of these tags. And then I have to go look at some BPM to me or if I have a form. Thank you Thank you. And what I'm working on is seeing if I can make an app auto do this for me. And I know that social media tool like offer can do a lot of this. Yes. Yes. I get to do this stuff with my tablet tomorrow. Thanks for asking, Ryan
Thank you. And what I'm working on is seeing if I can make an app auto do this for me. And I know that social media tool like offer can do a lot of this. Yes. Yes. I get to do this stuff with my tablet tomorrow. Thanks for asking, Ryan I don't know if we'll see if I can get it figured out tomorrow when I'm sort of live stream with it. But hey, we'll see. So I'm trying to basically make an app do this for me where other people just need to enter in their
I don't know if we'll see if I can get it figured out tomorrow when I'm sort of live stream with it. But hey, we'll see. So I'm trying to basically make an app do this for me where other people just need to enter in their Twitter and then my app I'm going to attempt to build is going to use fit out all of the information. And so that way all I have to enter every week is create the Twitter space and put it in there and then it does the rest
Twitter and then my app I'm going to attempt to build is going to use fit out all of the information. And so that way all I have to enter every week is create the Twitter space and put it in there and then it does the rest No matter who wants to sign up for it, like a database will hold it and fit out the information. But you have joined a good time because what I think I'm going to need is. And I'm having fun doing this visual like visually on the narrow board because I like looking at it on a visual standpoint
No matter who wants to sign up for it, like a database will hold it and fit out the information. But you have joined a good time because what I think I'm going to need is. And I'm having fun doing this visual like visually on the narrow board because I like looking at it on a visual standpoint But. If we go. So now I'm going to look at. Just giant. Make all of. Go smell. Nobody needs to read that right. We zoom in. We can read it. What I have home. Thank you for joining. I can make this app. I'm a jig. So here's what the tools I think
But. If we go. So now I'm going to look at. Just giant. Make all of. Go smell. Nobody needs to read that right. We zoom in. We can read it. What I have home. Thank you for joining. I can make this app. I'm a jig. So here's what the tools I think So the Twitter API information is going to be posting to Twitter. So. And then I. Feel like I want to make it with a react web app. I'm not sure if that's correct or not, but that's where my heads going. And then for the database, we are going to use. Run. Sequel. Hmm. And. And then
So the Twitter API information is going to be posting to Twitter. So. And then I. Feel like I want to make it with a react web app. I'm not sure if that's correct or not, but that's where my heads going. And then for the database, we are going to use. Run. Sequel. Hmm. And. And then Hmm. And. And then. This is where things will enter. Into. This. And then we'll spit out for this. I'm pretty sure there's an easier way of doing this like. Going in. Probably finding one that something's already done. And
Hmm. And. And then. This is where things will enter. Into. This. And then we'll spit out for this. I'm pretty sure there's an easier way of doing this like. Going in. Probably finding one that something's already done. And And. I'm stubborn and I want to learn the process, even if there is another way of doing it, because. And my mind these aren't all connected yet. Like I want to use my sequel because. What they used a lot of goat atty. And react web app is. Something I've done on the show enough of. So
And. I'm stubborn and I want to learn the process, even if there is another way of doing it, because. And my mind these aren't all connected yet. Like I want to use my sequel because. What they used a lot of goat atty. And react web app is. Something I've done on the show enough of. So So. This is kind of like the plan. I'm going to get it done tonight. So. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. And. We do have a read me, which is. And. I'm going to read me. I'm actually going to go open it and get up. So that way. Hi. Nice. Glad. Well, I hope the process works
So. This is kind of like the plan. I'm going to get it done tonight. So. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. And. We do have a read me, which is. And. I'm going to read me. I'm actually going to go open it and get up. So that way. Hi. Nice. Glad. Well, I hope the process works We're going to find out. We are going to find out. But we are also going to fill out the read me. The read me may be a little dumb down. But we're going to be able to. And what we're going to do. And. And what we're going to be able to do is. And. And
We're going to find out. We are going to find out. But we are also going to fill out the read me. The read me may be a little dumb down. But we're going to be able to. And what we're going to do. And. And what we're going to be able to do is. And. And And. And. We're going to write it in a way for me to understand. Not necessarily how another developer would understand it. Which is okay to me. And if anybody is just like if you're looking at read me. make it in said process. I know you have that. Um, or down. Or down. Be succinct tax
And. And. We're going to write it in a way for me to understand. Not necessarily how another developer would understand it. Which is okay to me. And if anybody is just like if you're looking at read me. make it in said process. I know you have that. Um, or down. Or down. Be succinct tax Be succinct tax. This is like, everybody's different. I mean, that is a very, very great question, Lucas. And thanks for joining me. I'm not going to react to do that. Or the my mischievous step. Because like, my new, this is me like my first time doing this
Be succinct tax. This is like, everybody's different. I mean, that is a very, very great question, Lucas. And thanks for joining me. I'm not going to react to do that. Or the my mischievous step. Because like, my new, this is me like my first time doing this So am I mischievous that for it? Yeah, that's what I thought. But is that because my sequel is just the Dina bass is not actually processing stuff. Yeah, because I was thinking I could probably make a form on the web app. And then then. Oh, okay. Okay. Let's make a comment. Come right right here
So am I mischievous that for it? Yeah, that's what I thought. But is that because my sequel is just the Dina bass is not actually processing stuff. Yeah, because I was thinking I could probably make a form on the web app. And then then. Oh, okay. Okay. Let's make a comment. Come right right here Okay. Oh, that was fun. I mean a note. I just do it visible. We have to like in the note. There we go. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. So I'm going to serve like just like a note. I'm going to be, it would go. Maybe I don't want to comment. I'm going to be right here
Okay. Oh, that was fun. I mean a note. I just do it visible. We have to like in the note. There we go. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. So I'm going to serve like just like a note. I'm going to be, it would go. Maybe I don't want to comment. I'm going to be right here So I'm like, I have this doing good and I find this hard to read someone coming these fonts. They're like, okay, I'm not done. So in my mind, I was previously going from here to here, but it's probably like this. To this. What do you think, y'all? Do we have this? And then
So I'm like, I have this doing good and I find this hard to read someone coming these fonts. They're like, okay, I'm not done. So in my mind, I was previously going from here to here, but it's probably like this. To this. What do you think, y'all? Do we have this? And then I use a track pad instead of a mouse because one day my mouse died. So and I had a track pad and then I have a gone back since. So if I like, I'm wondering what something's not moving for me. It's just I'm not used to doing it from a track pad. And then. And. Better. Oh, that's where. Thanks
I use a track pad instead of a mouse because one day my mouse died. So and I had a track pad and then I have a gone back since. So if I like, I'm wondering what something's not moving for me. It's just I'm not used to doing it from a track pad. And then. And. Better. Oh, that's where. Thanks Thanks. I think. And I'm given it a few hours tonight because if I don't get that far, I might come back to this. I'll probably be back in code and follow for the connection of my sequel and Twitter as well. Tonight is three hours because I want to get this done by like Sunday
Thanks. I think. And I'm given it a few hours tonight because if I don't get that far, I might come back to this. I'll probably be back in code and follow for the connection of my sequel and Twitter as well. Tonight is three hours because I want to get this done by like Sunday I'm giving myself a deadline because this is the thing that I've really realized with having this show is like, people come on and teach me all of this stuff. But I'm not doing as great as going and practicing it by myself because like Laura's live streams that are on Mondays
I'm giving myself a deadline because this is the thing that I've really realized with having this show is like, people come on and teach me all of this stuff. But I'm not doing as great as going and practicing it by myself because like Laura's live streams that are on Mondays She definitely has me practice while I'm on the show. But the rest of them are like, I just kind of. I soak it in, but I don't do anything with it. I really want to make this work and be like, look, and also to show on like one of my clients for Jonathan. I'm going to do this mostly by myself
She definitely has me practice while I'm on the show. But the rest of them are like, I just kind of. I soak it in, but I don't do anything with it. I really want to make this work and be like, look, and also to show on like one of my clients for Jonathan. I'm going to do this mostly by myself And why I say that is because like, if Lucas wasn't here telling me about, you know, skipping stuff, I probably would have gotten there. I just would have taken more time. So yeah. And I'm hoping this also helps other people learn about it too. You will go. And
And why I say that is because like, if Lucas wasn't here telling me about, you know, skipping stuff, I probably would have gotten there. I just would have taken more time. So yeah. And I'm hoping this also helps other people learn about it too. You will go. And You will go. And. We're just going to leave a blank because I don't know what we'll go into it. So. Need. Let's go like that. For now. And. I guess I could just write my notes here and then go back and do my. My read me. That'll work
You will go. And. We're just going to leave a blank because I don't know what we'll go into it. So. Need. Let's go like that. For now. And. I guess I could just write my notes here and then go back and do my. My read me. That'll work That'll work. Plus, you know, this is recorded, which makes it fun to miss something. Have you decided what to do? Um, I was thinking of React Web app. Is that what you're asking? Are you thinking something else? Anthony has taught me in the React Web app a few times
That'll work. Plus, you know, this is recorded, which makes it fun to miss something. Have you decided what to do? Um, I was thinking of React Web app. Is that what you're asking? Are you thinking something else? Anthony has taught me in the React Web app a few times So that kind of why I'm thinking that. Um, and I was about to actually go download it or go try to find it downloading. And the ones I get it downloaded, I was going to try to put in the fields I wanted to do. And then find our people. Oh, I just wanted to be like a form
So that kind of why I'm thinking that. Um, and I was about to actually go download it or go try to find it downloading. And the ones I get it downloaded, I was going to try to put in the fields I wanted to do. And then find our people. Oh, I just wanted to be like a form Like a kind of like a Google form. Maybe. I don't know. I haven't gotten there yet. That is a great question. I love how all of you are asking me really good questions. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. You smell? Um again new. One two three!!!<|kn|>ams. I am pretty sure this is what Anthony and I did
Like a kind of like a Google form. Maybe. I don't know. I haven't gotten there yet. That is a great question. I love how all of you are asking me really good questions. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. You smell? Um again new. One two three!!!<|kn|>ams. I am pretty sure this is what Anthony and I did I also did new pages with..
I also did new pages with.. Oh, I don't know if you saw this at home and so I basically want them to enter their Twitter handle and I separately somewhere and I'm not sure where in the process need to enter the Twitter space link and then it's going to combine it, the database of the Twitter handle and then somehow spit out this
Oh, I don't know if you saw this at home and so I basically want them to enter their Twitter handle and I separately somewhere and I'm not sure where in the process need to enter the Twitter space link and then it's going to combine it, the database of the Twitter handle and then somehow spit out this Like you can see me pointing out my computer from your pan. So it's auto-go linking these type of things. So does that make sense? Or do you still think I'm skipping stuff? My head I'm not skipping stuff but that does not mean I'm not skipping stuff out loud. I hope so
Like you can see me pointing out my computer from your pan. So it's auto-go linking these type of things. So does that make sense? Or do you still think I'm skipping stuff? My head I'm not skipping stuff but that does not mean I'm not skipping stuff out loud. I hope so I hope so. I mean I think a lot of like social media things like buffer does it as well but I'm more just like really wanted to see if I can make it happen even though there's something probably out there that can. So I am here
I hope so. I mean I think a lot of like social media things like buffer does it as well but I'm more just like really wanted to see if I can make it happen even though there's something probably out there that can. So I am here So I am here. We're going to create a new React app and also yell at my dog for being annoying. She's not yelling at her. She's a lazy. Mingum, Mingum. Can you stop? Hey, well, you're okay. You're okay. Yeah, you are. You're fine. I know. She's sassy pants. Sassy pants. Alright
So I am here. We're going to create a new React app and also yell at my dog for being annoying. She's not yelling at her. She's a lazy. Mingum, Mingum. Can you stop? Hey, well, you're okay. You're okay. Yeah, you are. You're fine. I know. She's sassy pants. Sassy pants. Alright Alright. Can I just close the run like didn't need to close? Oh, it just rolled down. Okay. Pretty sure I already have no. No, that's me. No, that's me. Hey, I got no. Oh, thank you. Okay, so we're doing it there. We have. Hi. Don't want to call it my out. I don't know
Alright. Can I just close the run like didn't need to close? Oh, it just rolled down. Okay. Pretty sure I already have no. No, that's me. No, that's me. Hey, I got no. Oh, thank you. Okay, so we're doing it there. We have. Hi. Don't want to call it my out. I don't know I don't know. I'm going to be able to do this. Ha, ha, ha. That's a good one. That is a good one. Let's get instead of my app if I can name it. Twitter tagging. Let's see what happens. Yes. Oh. Twitter. Oh. That's a good one. And a homey. I think this one's before you got here
I don't know. I'm going to be able to do this. Ha, ha, ha. That's a good one. That is a good one. Let's get instead of my app if I can name it. Twitter tagging. Let's see what happens. Yes. Oh. Twitter. Oh. That's a good one. And a homey. I think this one's before you got here The very, very first thing I did was create a new repo through command line. So I get used to it more. And so that way as I'm figuring this all out, I at least have it set up. I of course will still need to upload, but at least that's in there
The very, very first thing I did was create a new repo through command line. So I get used to it more. And so that way as I'm figuring this all out, I at least have it set up. I of course will still need to upload, but at least that's in there I have no idea how long this is going to take, but totally not long. Hey. Happy hacking. Oh, ho, ho, ho. You guys are coming up with some good names. Thank you. Some good turn. All right
I have no idea how long this is going to take, but totally not long. Hey. Happy hacking. Oh, ho, ho, ho. You guys are coming up with some good names. Thank you. Some good turn. All right All right. So, I'm going to take a screenshot of this because I have a feeling I'm going to forget it, but I don't need it right now. So I need to do see me. Okay. And that means Twitter tagging is right here. Oh, it's within
All right. So, I'm going to take a screenshot of this because I have a feeling I'm going to forget it, but I don't need it right now. So I need to do see me. Okay. And that means Twitter tagging is right here. Oh, it's within Oh, it's within. Well, you know what? We're just going to roll with this and hope that works. Right. I'm still going to be doing things in VS code. I was just getting it working. Oh, yeah. I did do that, but look, I made it within two. A folder within a folder. And I didn't need to do that
Oh, it's within. Well, you know what? We're just going to roll with this and hope that works. Right. I'm still going to be doing things in VS code. I was just getting it working. Oh, yeah. I did do that, but look, I made it within two. A folder within a folder. And I didn't need to do that And we did that this second time. I've done it. Yeah. I'm more thinking that I put something inside of something. So. I'm going to. I'm going to start over for a second. And I don't remember how to do this, but I want to do it quickly, not necessarily. Look, I made it within. I'm going to do this
And we did that this second time. I've done it. Yeah. I'm more thinking that I put something inside of something. So. I'm going to. I'm going to start over for a second. And I don't remember how to do this, but I want to do it quickly, not necessarily. Look, I made it within. I'm going to do this I'm going to find out if this was like the most regrettable thing ever, or if this actually helps. I don't know which. I'm not. I'm not. Oh, my God. You guys. Have the title. Like I thought it was a game paper or some level it looks like I was a big book. That. I think music for. It's See me
I'm going to find out if this was like the most regrettable thing ever, or if this actually helps. I don't know which. I'm not. I'm not. Oh, my God. You guys. Have the title. Like I thought it was a game paper or some level it looks like I was a big book. That. I think music for. It's See me It's See me. That's tough. And then do this. We should keep live code this. We should do that sometime. That would be fine. All right. Okay. Yay. I'm excited. All right. All right. All right. Okay. I'm excited. Okay. Yeah. I want to create a new repo. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. All right
It's See me. That's tough. And then do this. We should keep live code this. We should do that sometime. That would be fine. All right. Okay. Yay. I'm excited. All right. All right. All right. Okay. I'm excited. Okay. Yeah. I want to create a new repo. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. All right Okay. All right. All right. All right. I don't know. Okay. Is there an exit? There's no exit. Okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. Is there an exit? No. No, I have it
Okay. All right. All right. All right. I don't know. Okay. Is there an exit? There's no exit. Okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. Is there an exit? No. No, I have it No, I have it. It's this weird thing that actually a lot of people have been like, Jen, why are you doing it through a command line? I'm just going to keep doing it this way. I'm going to stick with one thing until I have like it down. I'm going to stick with one thing
No, I have it. It's this weird thing that actually a lot of people have been like, Jen, why are you doing it through a command line? I'm just going to keep doing it this way. I'm going to stick with one thing until I have like it down. I'm going to stick with one thing I'm going to stick with one thing. I'm going to stick with one thing. I just did the same thing off of it. Okay. Okay. Okay. I just need to... It's fine. It's fine. I will fear it now. Oh, hello. It's a good project to get help. Let's see if this works. Oh. Oh. Oh, guys. Y'all. I can't really
I'm going to stick with one thing. I'm going to stick with one thing. I just did the same thing off of it. Okay. Okay. Okay. I just need to... It's fine. It's fine. I will fear it now. Oh, hello. It's a good project to get help. Let's see if this works. Oh. Oh. Oh, guys. Y'all. I can't really I can't really. Okay. If you want your project to belong in organization, I have to local. Okay. We're about to find out. I'll wait. I'm going to give this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yay. Okay. Okay. I'm somewhere. I'm pretty sure
I can't really. Okay. If you want your project to belong in organization, I have to local. Okay. We're about to find out. I'll wait. I'm going to give this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Feel like I need to go create a nice equal database My end goal, because it would be curious if I could do it, would be use something like, or even or whatever it's called, because they do open source. Um, I saw this. So we'll do, I've been. I don't know how this is going to work, but we're going to give it a shot. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
My end goal, because it would be curious if I could do it, would be use something like, or even or whatever it's called, because they do open source. Um, I saw this. So we'll do, I've been. I don't know how this is going to work, but we're going to give it a shot. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, sorry, no, it's just take me a minute to get it all set up. Okay, I don't know how good, bad, or indifferent this is going to be, because I am wanting to use more open source ones instead of like Mongo, which is actually not open source
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, sorry, no, it's just take me a minute to get it all set up. Okay, I don't know how good, bad, or indifferent this is going to be, because I am wanting to use more open source ones instead of like Mongo, which is actually not open source So we'll click, we're going to do something now in my SQL. Next. Okay, let's go building. Create a service. Oh, there's a lot. So I'm going to click my SQL. And I don't know what happened. Why are you all grayed out? Change the name to be. And then we scroll down. And sure, we'll go with that
So we'll click, we're going to do something now in my SQL. Next. Okay, let's go building. Create a service. Oh, there's a lot. So I'm going to click my SQL. And I don't know what happened. Why are you all grayed out? Change the name to be. And then we scroll down. And sure, we'll go with that So this is the way I understand it is, I'm not obvious y'all, like, let's not be crazy. It's doing it where it's like a month free, luckily. So I'm just like testing this out as a platform to try it out. And if you know of any other like hosted database services and stuff, I know AWS has one
So this is the way I understand it is, I'm not obvious y'all, like, let's not be crazy. It's doing it where it's like a month free, luckily. So I'm just like testing this out as a platform to try it out. And if you know of any other like hosted database services and stuff, I know AWS has one I think it's like RSW or something like wait. I don't know why I can't think of it at the moment, but basically I'm just trying this out to see if it works. And I'm going to go back to Mongo. Just trying to Mongo or the mango. I always think that when I hear Mongo. That's what that looks like
I think it's like RSW or something like wait. I don't know why I can't think of it at the moment, but basically I'm just trying this out to see if it works. And I'm going to go back to Mongo. Just trying to Mongo or the mango. I always think that when I hear Mongo. That's what that looks like Great name. Amazon is RDS. Okay. Oh. Okay. Most functions become available once the first note is up green, including the one we'll show you next. Okay. And power off your service when you don't use it. Okay. That's kind of cool. I am curious though, like, if how. How to say this
Great name. Amazon is RDS. Okay. Oh. Okay. Most functions become available once the first note is up green, including the one we'll show you next. Okay. And power off your service when you don't use it. Okay. That's kind of cool. I am curious though, like, if how. How to say this How to say this. Like, what is the difference between like a manage database and an unmanned database? But like the way I understand it, at least when I was at GoDaddy, was like, managed, meant that if anything broke or anything, something else could deal with it
How to say this. Like, what is the difference between like a manage database and an unmanned database? But like the way I understand it, at least when I was at GoDaddy, was like, managed, meant that if anything broke or anything, something else could deal with it And, but it costs dogs amount of money where if it's unmanned and you have somebody that knows how to do it all, it can be a lot less expensive than being a company and doing it. We're going to find out. All right. So we got a database. Uh, but it's rebuilding. Okay. Well, we got that far
And, but it costs dogs amount of money where if it's unmanned and you have somebody that knows how to do it all, it can be a lot less expensive than being a company and doing it. We're going to find out. All right. So we got a database. Uh, but it's rebuilding. Okay. Well, we got that far I'm going to go back here. Oh. Hmm. We're like stuck overflow. Okay. I have a, I have built a new app with it create React app. The store I'm using is on local storage, now created my SQL database and I wanted to connect the database of that state. We'll show the values of the database
I'm going to go back here. Oh. Hmm. We're like stuck overflow. Okay. I have a, I have built a new app with it create React app. The store I'm using is on local storage, now created my SQL database and I wanted to connect the database of that state. We'll show the values of the database I'm not speaking my SQL protocol. And creating a web service and a language of your choice, which could be probably script running on node, where I can code up your already have. Okay. So we just think I don't think that it was Lucas, right? I'm pretty sure it was Lucas
I'm not speaking my SQL protocol. And creating a web service and a language of your choice, which could be probably script running on node, where I can code up your already have. Okay. So we just think I don't think that it was Lucas, right? I'm pretty sure it was Lucas Let me see if I remember me. Yeah. That Lucas was the one that mentioned it earlier. That we needed this. Um, general solution for the is back in node. JS. When and react. You search for any internet configuration of a full stock architect, we're using React and my SQL. You'll find similar results
Let me see if I remember me. Yeah. That Lucas was the one that mentioned it earlier. That we needed this. Um, general solution for the is back in node. JS. When and react. You search for any internet configuration of a full stock architect, we're using React and my SQL. You'll find similar results And we have it. Ha. Let me paste this over here so that way. We'll have it and you'll have it. Um. I win. So when say first off, I'm healing this article. And. So. It's so this is the totally random thing. I don't think I've ever connected a friend in a back end app. Hmm. Well. How to. How to add
And we have it. Ha. Let me paste this over here so that way. We'll have it and you'll have it. Um. I win. So when say first off, I'm healing this article. And. So. It's so this is the totally random thing. I don't think I've ever connected a friend in a back end app. Hmm. Well. How to. How to add How to. How to add. And yes. Yes. This. » Questions? I like I should be following all these people. I like one that makes smart things. I like I should be following all these people. I like I should be following all these people. I like I should be following all these people
How to. How to add. And yes. Yes. This. » Questions? I like I should be following all these people. I like one that makes smart things. I like I should be following all these people. I like I should be following all these people. I like I should be following all these people I like I should be following all these people. Okay, bye. Have fun or be or be or whatever you're doing. I am definitely. Bye. Okay. I am going to start trying to do what they're saying in here. Okay. I am going to start trying to do what they're saying in here
I like I should be following all these people. Okay, bye. Have fun or be or be or whatever you're doing. I am definitely. Bye. Okay. I am going to start trying to do what they're saying in here. Okay. I am going to start trying to do what they're saying in here And they're looking pretty pretty smart about this because I am definitely struggle about them and they're looking pretty pretty smart about this because I am definitely struggle about them. And it's also really cool to be able to I've done some next JS stuff
And they're looking pretty pretty smart about this because I am definitely struggle about them and they're looking pretty pretty smart about this because I am definitely struggle about them. And it's also really cool to be able to I've done some next JS stuff And I don't know if I necessarily in one of these I just thought it said, oh express me. I think done expressed. I feel like I've done expressed. I'm going to go look. You'll look at all the past episodes see if I have. Maybe I have it. Okay. No, I did next JS. So this one is new. Okay
And I don't know if I necessarily in one of these I just thought it said, oh express me. I think done expressed. I feel like I've done expressed. I'm going to go look. You'll look at all the past episodes see if I have. Maybe I have it. Okay. No, I did next JS. So this one is new. Okay Okay. I'm going to like it just because they took time to write it. Oh, I have to do. What are you doing? I mean, that is a solid question. Not going to lie. I. I'm going to do the same thing next JS be able to do the same things on the back end. No JS would because the goal is to do that
Okay. I'm going to like it just because they took time to write it. Oh, I have to do. What are you doing? I mean, that is a solid question. Not going to lie. I. I'm going to do the same thing next JS be able to do the same things on the back end. No JS would because the goal is to do that To run my seat block a bit. So my goals is how I got to know JS. Not that that's not really the best reason. BTS also do a few back lots. reason why you like one or over the other. oh sö clues. Thank you. Thank you
To run my seat block a bit. So my goals is how I got to know JS. Not that that's not really the best reason. BTS also do a few back lots. reason why you like one or over the other. oh sö clues. Thank you. Thank you Thank you. I would say another big reason is because it says backend is no express or like database connections and at least the Google is saying that next JS is run end. And thank you Ryan for visiting
Thank you. I would say another big reason is because it says backend is no express or like database connections and at least the Google is saying that next JS is run end. And thank you Ryan for visiting Yeah, I don't know if I can make it a full three hours going through this because it's kind of mind-melty. So I might do an extra stream. I'll probably do an extra stream tomorrow to work finish working through this. That is a good call. Oh, um. Oh, no
Yeah, I don't know if I can make it a full three hours going through this because it's kind of mind-melty. So I might do an extra stream. I'll probably do an extra stream tomorrow to work finish working through this. That is a good call. Oh, um. Oh, no Oh, um. Oh, no. I think for now I'm going to just do this app but not reality. I'm kind of getting multi-brain. Oh, okay. Hmm. All right. I feel like I'm getting multi-brain though because like just going through all of this and finally putting all the pieces together has been interesting
Oh, um. Oh, no. I think for now I'm going to just do this app but not reality. I'm kind of getting multi-brain. Oh, okay. Hmm. All right. I feel like I'm getting multi-brain though because like just going through all of this and finally putting all the pieces together has been interesting But it's, uh, I mean, I could definitely do something else just so that way you can kind of see this is what I'm setting up right now and working on making it so that way it posts my Twitter um, who wants to be tagged in Twitter every week
But it's, uh, I mean, I could definitely do something else just so that way you can kind of see this is what I'm setting up right now and working on making it so that way it posts my Twitter um, who wants to be tagged in Twitter every week Uh, because right now I'm manually doing it and tell me next JS has the back end connected for you already
Uh, because right now I'm manually doing it and tell me next JS has the back end connected for you already I feel like I'm like not computing words right now is where I feel like I'm going. I That's kind of where I'm at is I'm like I'm not computing like right now. Like y'all are clearly speaking normal words and it's just not sinking in
I feel like I'm like not computing words right now is where I feel like I'm going. I That's kind of where I'm at is I'm like I'm not computing like right now. Like y'all are clearly speaking normal words and it's just not sinking in So I think I was hoping to get to three hours but I would say almost two is pretty good.
