If you wanted away, hello, hello beautiful hymns. Oh, you guys can see my I got blood work done today So you guys know my arm right now That's cool But hello, hello beautiful humans welcome to another stream of teach gen tech and we have a returning guest Yay Ben is back to talk about accessibility which I'm excited about because it's been stuck in my head and I get yelled out by bots So Ben please introduce yourself and what you're gonna teach us today
That's cool But hello, hello beautiful humans welcome to another stream of teach gen tech and we have a returning guest Yay Ben is back to talk about accessibility which I'm excited about because it's been stuck in my head and I get yelled out by bots So Ben please introduce yourself and what you're gonna teach us today Yes. Well first of all I want to congratulate you on your blood impact working. It's good to hear that your blood does work Yes, howdy howdy. I'm Ben. I Blog about accessibility occasionally
Yes. Well first of all I want to congratulate you on your blood impact working. It's good to hear that your blood does work Yes, howdy howdy. I'm Ben. I Blog about accessibility occasionally I stream about accessibility far more often And maybe that's the world's shortest introduction to me I host a weekly show where I bring on guests teach me something about accessibility and web development and just building great user experiences for the web so This is my second time on the first time we kind of talked about accessibility like very very broadly I feel like we talked about and Just like minutes before the show
I stream about accessibility far more often And maybe that's the world's shortest introduction to me I host a weekly show where I bring on guests teach me something about accessibility and web development and just building great user experiences for the web so This is my second time on the first time we kind of talked about accessibility like very very broadly I feel like we talked about and Just like minutes before the show I mentioned in the green room that I'm gonna have you do part of this introduction as well but we talked about you know, can the wide diverse spectrum of Disability that exists and we talked about just some ways in which disability can impact your experience of the web It sounds like that's been stuck in your craw just a bit over the past month, right
I mentioned in the green room that I'm gonna have you do part of this introduction as well but we talked about you know, can the wide diverse spectrum of Disability that exists and we talked about just some ways in which disability can impact your experience of the web It sounds like that's been stuck in your craw just a bit over the past month, right Yes, I would love if you could just kind of talk me through some of the takeaways you've had and some of the things you've learned and been thinking about in the kind of vein of accessibility over the past month or so I Would say one of the the biggest things is remembering to do alt text for images and There's a bot on Twitter that likes to yell at me when I don't put it on there, which I think is really helpful because It's a helpful reminder of two-put alt text The thing that I have found frustrating is the fact that You can't go back and update alt text after Twitter has been posted and that's really frustrating because if It's not something I always think of but then I'm like oh, I should have done that whoops And I can't go back and by alt text just a for that clarification for the viewers of It is let's see if I can describe it
Yes, I would love if you could just kind of talk me through some of the takeaways you've had and some of the things you've learned and been thinking about in the kind of vein of accessibility over the past month or so I Would say one of the the biggest things is remembering to do alt text for images and There's a bot on Twitter that likes to yell at me when I don't put it on there, which I think is really helpful because It's a helpful reminder of two-put alt text The thing that I have found frustrating is the fact that You can't go back and update alt text after Twitter has been posted and that's really frustrating because if It's not something I always think of but then I'm like oh, I should have done that whoops And I can't go back and by alt text just a for that clarification for the viewers of It is let's see if I can describe it It is a In a text box that is associated with an image to describe an image to someone that may not be able to see it Yeah, we'll actually get to see some effects of that today, I think But yeah, the other part that's been really stuck with me is contrast Yeah, don't know like that just really stuck with me about like contrast and being able to like Are these gonna be good pairings and it's interesting to me because I Feel like I've always been very very curious about the fashion world and Like colors that go together or don't go together or patterns and it's interesting of how much that goes into like the The videography world so like if for anyone about to do like go on a show or something you don't want to use Where like very small squares or stripes or stuff like that it can really mess up the way the Video picks you up on the For the image, but then also it's like So much deeper than that when it's about You know websites and I was like Really stuck with me
It is a In a text box that is associated with an image to describe an image to someone that may not be able to see it Yeah, we'll actually get to see some effects of that today, I think But yeah, the other part that's been really stuck with me is contrast Yeah, don't know like that just really stuck with me about like contrast and being able to like Are these gonna be good pairings and it's interesting to me because I Feel like I've always been very very curious about the fashion world and Like colors that go together or don't go together or patterns and it's interesting of how much that goes into like the The videography world so like if for anyone about to do like go on a show or something you don't want to use Where like very small squares or stripes or stuff like that it can really mess up the way the Video picks you up on the For the image, but then also it's like So much deeper than that when it's about You know websites and I was like Really stuck with me Yeah, I never realized how much Accessibility can go into all these other avenues than just like web Yeah, absolutely and and it's it's one of those things where conventional wisdom can be wrong, you know where in in web like We've seen time and time again the like kind of trend towards minimalism, right
Yeah, I never realized how much Accessibility can go into all these other avenues than just like web Yeah, absolutely and and it's it's one of those things where conventional wisdom can be wrong, you know where in in web like We've seen time and time again the like kind of trend towards minimalism, right Show as few things as possible and see if you can kind of tuck away hide the things that you don't think people should care about Right, but what that leads to is oh well the bits we want to hide maybe we'll put this in a really really light gray So that it doesn't stand out, you know, yay minimalism and maybe for someone with standard visual perception abilities It's still totally like feasible to read that text but for Anyone with impacted vision in some way, right
Show as few things as possible and see if you can kind of tuck away hide the things that you don't think people should care about Right, but what that leads to is oh well the bits we want to hide maybe we'll put this in a really really light gray So that it doesn't stand out, you know, yay minimalism and maybe for someone with standard visual perception abilities It's still totally like feasible to read that text but for Anyone with impacted vision in some way, right You've just introduced like extra barriers extra circle there, right
You've just introduced like extra barriers extra circle there, right And and and we've got kind of this baseline assumption this default assumption of who we think is using our page and Very rarely do those assumptions actually include disability Interesting Yeah and so a Lot of how I see Accessibility work is about kind of bashing in the assumptions we make about our users, right
And and and we've got kind of this baseline assumption this default assumption of who we think is using our page and Very rarely do those assumptions actually include disability Interesting Yeah and so a Lot of how I see Accessibility work is about kind of bashing in the assumptions we make about our users, right You know you and I like I'm not I or I guess I I don't want to like presume too much about your vision But like you know, I can look at something and go this is plainly readable, right? Sure, that's a light gray, but like I can plainly read it, right
You know you and I like I'm not I or I guess I I don't want to like presume too much about your vision But like you know, I can look at something and go this is plainly readable, right? Sure, that's a light gray, but like I can plainly read it, right But I'm not if I'm doing that I'm not taking into account people who You know might have been colorblind from birth or might have developed cataracts Even just right as you like a thing I learned earlier today like as you age Some of the cones in your eyes Become less sensitive and this actually shifts your Perception of color over time away from like your ability to like perceive like reds and whatnot interesting
But I'm not if I'm doing that I'm not taking into account people who You know might have been colorblind from birth or might have developed cataracts Even just right as you like a thing I learned earlier today like as you age Some of the cones in your eyes Become less sensitive and this actually shifts your Perception of color over time away from like your ability to like perceive like reds and whatnot interesting Yeah, so We we have a lot of these like built-in assumptions about our users and how they navigate the web Accessibility is about like kind of breaking in the door and and like recognizing that This isn't a hypothetical we have users who experience the web differently than we do and they have every right to experience the web and have access to the web So that's Some of what a lot of what we're going to focus on today is this concept of an assistive technology which is I would define it as a For the purposes of this conversation a piece of hardware software or operating system level setting that Disabled people can use to better facilitate Navigating their device navigating the web etc I dig it and I Don't want to go in and rehash this from last episode
Yeah, so We we have a lot of these like built-in assumptions about our users and how they navigate the web Accessibility is about like kind of breaking in the door and and like recognizing that This isn't a hypothetical we have users who experience the web differently than we do and they have every right to experience the web and have access to the web So that's Some of what a lot of what we're going to focus on today is this concept of an assistive technology which is I would define it as a For the purposes of this conversation a piece of hardware software or operating system level setting that Disabled people can use to better facilitate Navigating their device navigating the web etc I dig it and I Don't want to go in and rehash this from last episode We did talk about like a lot of different Disabilities and how they may show up and for those watching today like I would challenge you to just be open to What we're talking about today, but then also be open to you is that something that would help your own life so Instead of going through well, this is for this exact visibility or anything like that there It can be so helpful in many other ways too Absolutely Absolutely, and so kind of the first place I want to start is with Keyboard navigation because this is one of those things that a lot of people benefit from keyboard navigation Awesome
We did talk about like a lot of different Disabilities and how they may show up and for those watching today like I would challenge you to just be open to What we're talking about today, but then also be open to you is that something that would help your own life so Instead of going through well, this is for this exact visibility or anything like that there It can be so helpful in many other ways too Absolutely Absolutely, and so kind of the first place I want to start is with Keyboard navigation because this is one of those things that a lot of people benefit from keyboard navigation Awesome Yes, you've got the demo I sent over cool
Yes, you've got the demo I sent over cool So Keyboard navigation is really helpful especially if for instance you can't use a mouse so that could be for instance people with mobility disorders such as like arthritis or Parkinson's for instance like people who might struggle with the precision control that a mouse might require You think about it like a mouse cursor is like the cursor itself is something floating around This intangible two-dimensional plane a mouse cursor is not a very helpful Model for people who are blind for instance or have a high degree of vision impairment And so keyboard navigation also impacts people with visual disabilities as well and even just you know You know, I think we talked about the curb cut effect last time this idea that like Disability accommodations can benefit non disabled people as well like if one of your hands is occupied say maybe you're a parent holding your newborn Right, you might not have ready access to your mouse and so it might just be easier to use your keyboard keyboards are also Like keyboard navigation is hugely impactful for power users of technology You find that the better you get with computers You tend to just be able to do things faster with the keyboard than you would with the mouse So lots of people benefit from keyboard navigation You've probably already started incorporating if if you're a developer or even just kind of tangentially in this space You've probably already begun incorporating keyboard navigation techniques into your Your just experience of the web so we're gonna practice a few Things that you can do with keyboard navigation and Jen I want to start with what your baseline knowledge is so what are some keys you can use or some ways you can use your keyboard to navigate a site Uh I'm the first thing that comes to mind is the search function on Mac which is the command space by default Meaning that and I say it that way because I don't know where half the stuff is on my computer and without that I would not know how to use the calculator on my computer or search different things and it can search You know my documents it can bring you up online
So Keyboard navigation is really helpful especially if for instance you can't use a mouse so that could be for instance people with mobility disorders such as like arthritis or Parkinson's for instance like people who might struggle with the precision control that a mouse might require You think about it like a mouse cursor is like the cursor itself is something floating around This intangible two-dimensional plane a mouse cursor is not a very helpful Model for people who are blind for instance or have a high degree of vision impairment And so keyboard navigation also impacts people with visual disabilities as well and even just you know You know, I think we talked about the curb cut effect last time this idea that like Disability accommodations can benefit non disabled people as well like if one of your hands is occupied say maybe you're a parent holding your newborn Right, you might not have ready access to your mouse and so it might just be easier to use your keyboard keyboards are also Like keyboard navigation is hugely impactful for power users of technology You find that the better you get with computers You tend to just be able to do things faster with the keyboard than you would with the mouse So lots of people benefit from keyboard navigation You've probably already started incorporating if if you're a developer or even just kind of tangentially in this space You've probably already begun incorporating keyboard navigation techniques into your Your just experience of the web so we're gonna practice a few Things that you can do with keyboard navigation and Jen I want to start with what your baseline knowledge is so what are some keys you can use or some ways you can use your keyboard to navigate a site Uh I'm the first thing that comes to mind is the search function on Mac which is the command space by default Meaning that and I say it that way because I don't know where half the stuff is on my computer and without that I would not know how to use the calculator on my computer or search different things and it can search You know my documents it can bring you up online It is something that I use on a regular basis um Also another keyboard shortcut that I use on my computer is something that I set up with snag it So which is it that takes screenshots and it's like if Being able to do that and multitask um When I hear like Full keyboard things it makes me start thinking of macros and I don't know anything about that um to I've always been like that's cool, but those are ones that come to mind I realized that I'm probably using more than I realize Sure So we're going to talk about keyboard shortcuts that are like built into the browser But I wanted to circle back to um the mac feature that you were talking about uh Which is called spotlight search which is when you do command space um if you think about it That's an assistive technology right um Gen Part in me if I'm wrong, but you're open about having like 80 HD right you have oh yeah
It is something that I use on a regular basis um Also another keyboard shortcut that I use on my computer is something that I set up with snag it So which is it that takes screenshots and it's like if Being able to do that and multitask um When I hear like Full keyboard things it makes me start thinking of macros and I don't know anything about that um to I've always been like that's cool, but those are ones that come to mind I realized that I'm probably using more than I realize Sure So we're going to talk about keyboard shortcuts that are like built into the browser But I wanted to circle back to um the mac feature that you were talking about uh Which is called spotlight search which is when you do command space um if you think about it That's an assistive technology right um Gen Part in me if I'm wrong, but you're open about having like 80 HD right you have oh yeah I'm 80 HD
I'm 80 HD I'm dyslexic I want you to consider this I want you to consider the spotlight search and 80 HD assistive technology because A thing that I have noticed is uh like for folks with 80 HD right is like having like A rigid organization is not always helpful right like you don't necessarily know where you put things and having a directory structure Where you have to like specifically hunt down
I'm dyslexic I want you to consider this I want you to consider the spotlight search and 80 HD assistive technology because A thing that I have noticed is uh like for folks with 80 HD right is like having like A rigid organization is not always helpful right like you don't necessarily know where you put things and having a directory structure Where you have to like specifically hunt down Oh, I put this file in this folder in this folder in this folder Yeah, I never remember yeah, it's you know um The spotlight search allows you to treat your entire file system as a doom pile a doom drawer Um for those listening a doom pile or a doom drawer when uh associated with 80 HD is many individuals with 80 HD really struggle with um Executive oh, what is it called executive uh function
Oh, I put this file in this folder in this folder in this folder Yeah, I never remember yeah, it's you know um The spotlight search allows you to treat your entire file system as a doom pile a doom drawer Um for those listening a doom pile or a doom drawer when uh associated with 80 HD is many individuals with 80 HD really struggle with um Executive oh, what is it called executive uh function I believe Basically you might want to clean everything, but it doesn't necessarily make sense where you would put it So you end up piling it all together where it's cleaned up, but it's a doom pile It goes there
I believe Basically you might want to clean everything, but it doesn't necessarily make sense where you would put it So you end up piling it all together where it's cleaned up, but it's a doom pile It goes there You don't know where else it's gonna go
You don't know where else it's gonna go So it's just gonna go there and Yeah, it's out of the way right but it's not necessarily like you know a neurotypical person's not gonna look at this and go I see the dewey decimal system you've implemented here, you know Just kind of all the things in a mishmash and that is honestly how I I think that is a great way of describing how my computer setup that is how my life is set up And it's not something that I'm like consciously going
So it's just gonna go there and Yeah, it's out of the way right but it's not necessarily like you know a neurotypical person's not gonna look at this and go I see the dewey decimal system you've implemented here, you know Just kind of all the things in a mishmash and that is honestly how I I think that is a great way of describing how my computer setup that is how my life is set up And it's not something that I'm like consciously going Oh, yes, let me do that because that sounds cool It is honestly and now that you mention it I lose Graphics on my computer all the time unless I just leave them in my download folder If they're not in my download folder, I'm like, I don't know what I called that Or where I put it So this this gets to even before we get we get to keep ordination this gets to something I want to emphasize which is just about anything can be an assistive technology Right We're not talking about necessarily things you have to purchase or things that have the accessibility label on it right another thing that I want to consider in this camp of assistive technology is password managers like last pass or one password or anything like that because and and Upcoming standard of the web content accessibility guidelines that I think is supposed to be Made official in December Actually has like an accessibility requirement for websites to not break password manager functionality because remembering Passwords secure passwords is what we consider a cognitive function and that can be especially difficult for people with memory issues And so I'm just laughing because I literally to get into an account like Google it locks me out and I have to Reset the password
Oh, yes, let me do that because that sounds cool It is honestly and now that you mention it I lose Graphics on my computer all the time unless I just leave them in my download folder If they're not in my download folder, I'm like, I don't know what I called that Or where I put it So this this gets to even before we get we get to keep ordination this gets to something I want to emphasize which is just about anything can be an assistive technology Right We're not talking about necessarily things you have to purchase or things that have the accessibility label on it right another thing that I want to consider in this camp of assistive technology is password managers like last pass or one password or anything like that because and and Upcoming standard of the web content accessibility guidelines that I think is supposed to be Made official in December Actually has like an accessibility requirement for websites to not break password manager functionality because remembering Passwords secure passwords is what we consider a cognitive function and that can be especially difficult for people with memory issues And so I'm just laughing because I literally to get into an account like Google it locks me out and I have to Reset the password I've reset my passwords on almost everything so often That it is because a Google's backup security of like allowing you by like if you have it on your phone or something that has caused me to not get completely locked out of all of my systems and And The password manager would be phenomenal
I've reset my passwords on almost everything so often That it is because a Google's backup security of like allowing you by like if you have it on your phone or something that has caused me to not get completely locked out of all of my systems and And The password manager would be phenomenal I should actually look into that Yeah, and and it is I don't think a password manager was built with specifically disabled people with like memory issues or ADHD in mind Right, it's a powerful tool for that and the impact that it has is Like it's a disparate impact where benefits everyone like seriously if you don't have a password manager Like get a password manager today, but It especially benefits people with cognitive disabilities in a very real way another person that it might benefit is someone who needs to use voice control You can imagine having to announce your password allowed with voice control A is unreliable because we know how good voice control is like it's messy Be it's insecure because if you have to do that when you're in public like you just absolutely neutered the security of Your password And I think that's another one that you mentioned about Accessibility as well is using voice to text that is something I use all of the time and I could see how difficult I know how knowing it is when it doesn't work and Being able to have to do that for your password
I should actually look into that Yeah, and and it is I don't think a password manager was built with specifically disabled people with like memory issues or ADHD in mind Right, it's a powerful tool for that and the impact that it has is Like it's a disparate impact where benefits everyone like seriously if you don't have a password manager Like get a password manager today, but It especially benefits people with cognitive disabilities in a very real way another person that it might benefit is someone who needs to use voice control You can imagine having to announce your password allowed with voice control A is unreliable because we know how good voice control is like it's messy Be it's insecure because if you have to do that when you're in public like you just absolutely neutered the security of Your password And I think that's another one that you mentioned about Accessibility as well is using voice to text that is something I use all of the time and I could see how difficult I know how knowing it is when it doesn't work and Being able to have to do that for your password I could I would become living at technology Technology and I fight sometimes Absolutely and and so assistive technology is just anything that a disabled person needs to use or or can use to better facilitate their Like ability to navigate their devices or navigate the web Um and so yeah, let's let's actually get to keyboard navigation But I think that this has been a very valuable segue because like or uh Detour that's the word because it really hits something home about um Just the like Variety of Assistive technologies that are out there and even just the like perhaps necessity of what we like necessity of creativity in what we consider Um assistive tech so right right yeah Um all right, so in the browser we have a few very standard um Means of navigating a page with the keyboard So the first one that I want to talk through actually want to see if there's a way to open up in that code sandbox If there's a way to open it up just so that you can just see the page I think you see that like jklvhv uh dot csv dot app Um if you just open that up in a new Yeah, I was like oh sorry
I could I would become living at technology Technology and I fight sometimes Absolutely and and so assistive technology is just anything that a disabled person needs to use or or can use to better facilitate their Like ability to navigate their devices or navigate the web Um and so yeah, let's let's actually get to keyboard navigation But I think that this has been a very valuable segue because like or uh Detour that's the word because it really hits something home about um Just the like Variety of Assistive technologies that are out there and even just the like perhaps necessity of what we like necessity of creativity in what we consider Um assistive tech so right right yeah Um all right, so in the browser we have a few very standard um Means of navigating a page with the keyboard So the first one that I want to talk through actually want to see if there's a way to open up in that code sandbox If there's a way to open it up just so that you can just see the page I think you see that like jklvhv uh dot csv dot app Um if you just open that up in a new Yeah, I was like oh sorry Yeah, yeah, just remove the the distractions there we go. Okay. This will make things easier Um, so this is interesting. Yeah, thank you. Uh, this is just a simple form Um, I have done nothing special here
Yeah, yeah, just remove the the distractions there we go. Okay. This will make things easier Um, so this is interesting. Yeah, thank you. Uh, this is just a simple form Um, I have done nothing special here I haven't done anything to like customize the keyboard experience All of this is just baked into the browser Cool
I haven't done anything to like customize the keyboard experience All of this is just baked into the browser Cool So we've got a couple links um, so the first thing I want to introduce you to is the concept of focus and focus We should think of as um, it's it's kind of like where the keyboard cursor is the idea here is your keyboard will navigate between different interactive elements different things that uh, well, let's just see it so the way to focus is you hit the tab key So let's just hit tab and you can see yeah, I went to a hyperlink you went to hyperlink Let's yeah and let's just keep going Um, yay Okay, so what do you notice about this
So we've got a couple links um, so the first thing I want to introduce you to is the concept of focus and focus We should think of as um, it's it's kind of like where the keyboard cursor is the idea here is your keyboard will navigate between different interactive elements different things that uh, well, let's just see it so the way to focus is you hit the tab key So let's just hit tab and you can see yeah, I went to a hyperlink you went to hyperlink Let's yeah and let's just keep going Um, yay Okay, so what do you notice about this Um At a does do that, but I'm like, I don't know how to oh that was complicated So I went to developer to see if there were other job pedals and I hit enter Yeah, because I was like, you know, and I would have to click it to see the other options But it's actually a down option a down button instead of works uh space also works, I think Um important thing to keep in mind these elements are all part of a form and in a form context enter always means submit That's fair And so it's just more like I have one to three years All right, and then I don't know shift tab works Shift tab does work
Um At a does do that, but I'm like, I don't know how to oh that was complicated So I went to developer to see if there were other job pedals and I hit enter Yeah, because I was like, you know, and I would have to click it to see the other options But it's actually a down option a down button instead of works uh space also works, I think Um important thing to keep in mind these elements are all part of a form and in a form context enter always means submit That's fair And so it's just more like I have one to three years All right, and then I don't know shift tab works Shift tab does work Yeah, so shift Move you backwards in the focus order And then so and submit Yeah, that was fine
Yeah, so shift Move you backwards in the focus order And then so and submit Yeah, that was fine So this is this is you know the world's quickest demo right but uh What a hammer's home is a few things one in hammer's home here's how you move the focus It's tabbing right and one thing I want to uh point out is that Only certain things were tabbable right only certain things were focusable and all of those things Were interactive in some way right so our our heading our static text Even the labels for the different form fields those weren't focusable the only things that we could tab to or things that were Interactive with the keyboard Um and so uh with the hyperlinks by the way uh you could use i want to say it's um Space I could be very wrong no enter it's enter okay um i don't know it's not opening that Yeah, I set the hyperlink to be basically blank so it just go to the same page so that's that's Poor demo part on like poor demo in my part there uh but yeah and then enter or sorry the button is Like to activate the button if you tab down to the button um You could do enter or space i believe So That's um yeah, so broadly speaking what we're doing here is we're tabbing between interactive things and when we get to something like a The the select dropdown for the job title you like the You're you're on the single element that is the select right that that dropdown And to further interact with it you have to use like space or the arrow keys um to make your selection there um and then when we got down to the radio buttons uh can you tab down to the radio buttons for me again
So this is this is you know the world's quickest demo right but uh What a hammer's home is a few things one in hammer's home here's how you move the focus It's tabbing right and one thing I want to uh point out is that Only certain things were tabbable right only certain things were focusable and all of those things Were interactive in some way right so our our heading our static text Even the labels for the different form fields those weren't focusable the only things that we could tab to or things that were Interactive with the keyboard Um and so uh with the hyperlinks by the way uh you could use i want to say it's um Space I could be very wrong no enter it's enter okay um i don't know it's not opening that Yeah, I set the hyperlink to be basically blank so it just go to the same page so that's that's Poor demo part on like poor demo in my part there uh but yeah and then enter or sorry the button is Like to activate the button if you tab down to the button um You could do enter or space i believe So That's um yeah, so broadly speaking what we're doing here is we're tabbing between interactive things and when we get to something like a The the select dropdown for the job title you like the You're you're on the single element that is the select right that that dropdown And to further interact with it you have to use like space or the arrow keys um to make your selection there um and then when we got down to the radio buttons uh can you tab down to the radio buttons for me again I think to note is that this whole Think your focus currently seems to be on the radio button that says up zero to one in this case But if you think about it the focus is kind of bigger picture It's really on this whole group of radio options right yeah I think individually you're using your arrow keys right now Right and even if I go up and down it's still the arrow keys like it's still like only going within here instead of like a tab Or a shift tab that can go backwards Yeah, um and that's something that um One thing to point out right like all of the stuff if if you go back to the Code sandbox link the like where you can actually see the code I'm going to indicate something here when we look at the html um like there's I haven't added any JavaScript all I've done is like I added some CSS But like all I've done is Implemented everything in good semantic html So semantic html or you'll sometimes hear it called semantic markup is this notion that we are using Elements that best describe the expected behavior functionality meaning and stuff like that And the browser will take care of the functionality for us So the fact that we implemented things as like you know They select With options meant that we got that like drop down behavior for free the fact that we Implemented you know input fields and select and radio and stuff like that that gave us all of the keyboard behavior We needed just out of the box
I think to note is that this whole Think your focus currently seems to be on the radio button that says up zero to one in this case But if you think about it the focus is kind of bigger picture It's really on this whole group of radio options right yeah I think individually you're using your arrow keys right now Right and even if I go up and down it's still the arrow keys like it's still like only going within here instead of like a tab Or a shift tab that can go backwards Yeah, um and that's something that um One thing to point out right like all of the stuff if if you go back to the Code sandbox link the like where you can actually see the code I'm going to indicate something here when we look at the html um like there's I haven't added any JavaScript all I've done is like I added some CSS But like all I've done is Implemented everything in good semantic html So semantic html or you'll sometimes hear it called semantic markup is this notion that we are using Elements that best describe the expected behavior functionality meaning and stuff like that And the browser will take care of the functionality for us So the fact that we implemented things as like you know They select With options meant that we got that like drop down behavior for free the fact that we Implemented you know input fields and select and radio and stuff like that that gave us all of the keyboard behavior We needed just out of the box We had to do none of that Very cool and hello Anthony. Hey, here. Hello
We had to do none of that Very cool and hello Anthony. Hey, here. Hello Yeah Let me show you one more cool thing with this uh, oh my god Anthony um Uh, let uh, let's go back to the uh, little demo link for that uh forum uh where we were just seeing just the forum And I'll show you one more thing and this has nothing to do with keyboard navigability But it is an accessibility feature uh, can you click one of the farm fields labels No, I have them there I can double click it Wait So and it will use or uh, it's salty Sorry, I just started I think you really oh, I'm really but I would just like that yeah, single click I cannot single click it and only goes to the forum though
Yeah Let me show you one more cool thing with this uh, oh my god Anthony um Uh, let uh, let's go back to the uh, little demo link for that uh forum uh where we were just seeing just the forum And I'll show you one more thing and this has nothing to do with keyboard navigability But it is an accessibility feature uh, can you click one of the farm fields labels No, I have them there I can double click it Wait So and it will use or uh, it's salty Sorry, I just started I think you really oh, I'm really but I would just like that yeah, single click I cannot single click it and only goes to the forum though So if you think about this So this is actually intended right and I can show you how this was done But if you think about uh, this is actually a really good thing um because what you've effectively done is when you click the label The form field that the label is connected to gets focused and this is really cool for Again, people with mobility issues that might struggle with precision like tapping things like precisely It's also really beneficial on mobile where things show up far far smaller Um, so effectively what we've done is our label Uh, adds to the overall hitbox of the forfield and so that's a hugely important accessibility feature The way we did that if you go back to the source code again um Is the input has an ID And then the label you'll see that uh, the ID here is name and what's confusing is that there's also a name attribute that's also set the name you can ignore the name attribute but uh, this label has this for uh, we can see it better I think with um Uh, the the select because the select has the same functionality this there's um that select element has an ID of job title And the above it there's a label with a for set to job titles So the fact is that the for attribute matches the ID of the form field and that's what connects to Very cool
So if you think about this So this is actually intended right and I can show you how this was done But if you think about uh, this is actually a really good thing um because what you've effectively done is when you click the label The form field that the label is connected to gets focused and this is really cool for Again, people with mobility issues that might struggle with precision like tapping things like precisely It's also really beneficial on mobile where things show up far far smaller Um, so effectively what we've done is our label Uh, adds to the overall hitbox of the forfield and so that's a hugely important accessibility feature The way we did that if you go back to the source code again um Is the input has an ID And then the label you'll see that uh, the ID here is name and what's confusing is that there's also a name attribute that's also set the name you can ignore the name attribute but uh, this label has this for uh, we can see it better I think with um Uh, the the select because the select has the same functionality this there's um that select element has an ID of job title And the above it there's a label with a for set to job titles So the fact is that the for attribute matches the ID of the form field and that's what connects to Very cool Yeah, so That's keyboard navigation um and a bit of other stuff besides but um, yeah, do you have any questions about that
Yeah, so That's keyboard navigation um and a bit of other stuff besides but um, yeah, do you have any questions about that I'm not about what This is doing my my biggest question especially because like Grant and this is like what the They'll like Latin thing that comes with um, yeah The gibberish But um Something that came to mind that is something that I really struggle with is the fact that If I was sent this form I honestly would just skip the paragraph and just fill everything out without realizing what the form is for because It's going to take me too long to read Sure, so How would somebody if they used some type of reader would it still read the labels or Um because you the label goes and clicks the actual bubble or would you be able to you Okay, so I hope you get what I'm saying or asking you're you're asking about screen readers um and um Actually, yes, so because we did that whole fourth thing that's another accessibility benefit is you effectively name the field and so when the screen reader user navigates to the field they'll be told like Edit text name or Like drop down job title develop or something like that like the exact announcements differ based on what screen reader But like you'll be told the the name That you gave it because you linked up the label element Okay, and so yeah that like doing that whole fourth thing like that is like required more or less like there There's new wants there, but you you basically need to do that for The the four attribute thing to have an accessible form Got it Yeah, so uh, I think that can actually segue in uh segue us into using a screen reader so um I have I have been in the fortunate position of introducing people to screen readers many times And what I found is that um If you don't go about this in a very specific order people will have a very Overwhelming first impression of a screen reader so What I'm gonna do before I tell you how to even turn on your screen reader is I'm gonna tell you how to turn off your screen reader I'm gonna give you your your panic button your escape hatches I'm laughing because I used to work at Verizon for many years and it was right when the iPhones and Android's launched And when people would turn it on it was hysterical that they would make Go all the way to the store to get it to be turned off which believe me I it was annoying for me to you And I it would be that overwhelmed yet
I'm not about what This is doing my my biggest question especially because like Grant and this is like what the They'll like Latin thing that comes with um, yeah The gibberish But um Something that came to mind that is something that I really struggle with is the fact that If I was sent this form I honestly would just skip the paragraph and just fill everything out without realizing what the form is for because It's going to take me too long to read Sure, so How would somebody if they used some type of reader would it still read the labels or Um because you the label goes and clicks the actual bubble or would you be able to you Okay, so I hope you get what I'm saying or asking you're you're asking about screen readers um and um Actually, yes, so because we did that whole fourth thing that's another accessibility benefit is you effectively name the field and so when the screen reader user navigates to the field they'll be told like Edit text name or Like drop down job title develop or something like that like the exact announcements differ based on what screen reader But like you'll be told the the name That you gave it because you linked up the label element Okay, and so yeah that like doing that whole fourth thing like that is like required more or less like there There's new wants there, but you you basically need to do that for The the four attribute thing to have an accessible form Got it Yeah, so uh, I think that can actually segue in uh segue us into using a screen reader so um I have I have been in the fortunate position of introducing people to screen readers many times And what I found is that um If you don't go about this in a very specific order people will have a very Overwhelming first impression of a screen reader so What I'm gonna do before I tell you how to even turn on your screen reader is I'm gonna tell you how to turn off your screen reader I'm gonna give you your your panic button your escape hatches I'm laughing because I used to work at Verizon for many years and it was right when the iPhones and Android's launched And when people would turn it on it was hysterical that they would make Go all the way to the store to get it to be turned off which believe me I it was annoying for me to you And I it would be that overwhelmed yet It was also really funny Yeah, yeah, it's it's Yeah, I've definitely it's very amusing, but it's one of those things where like I've noticed people get this like very sour first impression of screen readers and then they don't know like They they've resolved to never touch it again like with a 10-foot pole And so we're gonna be using the screen reader that is built into Mac OS and that is called voiceover and voiceover has two escape hatches
It was also really funny Yeah, yeah, it's it's Yeah, I've definitely it's very amusing, but it's one of those things where like I've noticed people get this like very sour first impression of screen readers and then they don't know like They they've resolved to never touch it again like with a 10-foot pole And so we're gonna be using the screen reader that is built into Mac OS and that is called voiceover and voiceover has two escape hatches I want you to remember Okay, the first if you don't want to just like if you don't want to turn off the screen reader, but you just wanted to shut up immediately Hit control Okay, okay, so Control should like always work control just that's the instant shut up voiceover command all right So what's again
I want you to remember Okay, the first if you don't want to just like if you don't want to turn off the screen reader, but you just wanted to shut up immediately Hit control Okay, okay, so Control should like always work control just that's the instant shut up voiceover command all right So what's again What is the what is the shut up voiceover command control? Awesome
What is the what is the shut up voiceover command control? Awesome I want to control that Yes exactly The other thing that you can do if you just want to turn off voiceover completely is so voiceover will have a little like read out It'll have this like black display with white text on it that like says like it reads out what the screen reader is reading allowed And in the top left corner there's gonna be a little white X it looks like an ornamental detail It doesn't look like it's a button
I want to control that Yes exactly The other thing that you can do if you just want to turn off voiceover completely is so voiceover will have a little like read out It'll have this like black display with white text on it that like says like it reads out what the screen reader is reading allowed And in the top left corner there's gonna be a little white X it looks like an ornamental detail It doesn't look like it's a button It's a closed button and if you click it that will turn off voiceover completely So those are your two with state patches if So and one thing I've noticed when when doing this over streaming is that You basically need to use those escape hatches frequently otherwise you or I are not going to be able to hear each other So just be very over eager with your escape hatches got it cool So with that in mind are we ready to turn on voiceover
It's a closed button and if you click it that will turn off voiceover completely So those are your two with state patches if So and one thing I've noticed when when doing this over streaming is that You basically need to use those escape hatches frequently otherwise you or I are not going to be able to hear each other So just be very over eager with your escape hatches got it cool So with that in mind are we ready to turn on voiceover I Nervously yes, okay
I Nervously yes, okay There's nothing to worry about just You so the way I do this is I like to open up spot light search command space and I like to type in Oh Yeah, I can you type in accessibility
There's nothing to worry about just You so the way I do this is I like to open up spot light search command space and I like to type in Oh Yeah, I can you type in accessibility There we go All right, and then that first option there yep And then you can open up your accessibility settings There are keyboard shortcuts to do all of this but I find it easier to remember to go through the spotlight search again doom pile In the left hand nav there is an option that says voiceover Yep, there's a checkbox that says enable voiceover And it's gonna think for a bit especially because it's the first time Use voiceover there's an op yeah, yeah, go ahead We'll think for a bit it scared me It's scared me Okay, I can't seem to hear it, but that's fine It talks faster too Yeah, um, yeah, it's very fast Well, I think my spoken content is sped up Oh, okay Okay, so is there a way to share my voice Ernt voice my screens Yeah, if you can do that that might be helpful um Because I can't hear it
There we go All right, and then that first option there yep And then you can open up your accessibility settings There are keyboard shortcuts to do all of this but I find it easier to remember to go through the spotlight search again doom pile In the left hand nav there is an option that says voiceover Yep, there's a checkbox that says enable voiceover And it's gonna think for a bit especially because it's the first time Use voiceover there's an op yeah, yeah, go ahead We'll think for a bit it scared me It's scared me Okay, I can't seem to hear it, but that's fine It talks faster too Yeah, um, yeah, it's very fast Well, I think my spoken content is sped up Oh, okay Okay, so is there a way to share my voice Ernt voice my screens Yeah, if you can do that that might be helpful um Because I can't hear it I don't think the viewers can hear it and that doesn't I don't know like when to start talking like I don't know when you've used your state patch Um, I don't know if streamer glitz you Share audio but I will look really quick it also I see what you mean and why people want it to go away easily
I don't think the viewers can hear it and that doesn't I don't know like when to start talking like I don't know when you've used your state patch Um, I don't know if streamer glitz you Share audio but I will look really quick it also I see what you mean and why people want it to go away easily Yeah, that was Uh, overwhelming is a very very good way of saying it
Yeah, that was Uh, overwhelming is a very very good way of saying it I don't see a way to share audio, but hey Um, folks at home can follow along with their their own screen readers But in that case uh then because I don't know when it's actually talking versus when you have used in the state patch I'm gonna need you to like explicitly tell me um, so we're gonna Basically, I want to like queue up and exercise out of time if that makes sense So we're gonna I'm gonna introduce you today to a few different ways to navigate a webpage using a screen reader The first one that we're gonna do is um just simply tapping right this is no different from When you are just tapping for keyboard navigation, right
I don't see a way to share audio, but hey Um, folks at home can follow along with their their own screen readers But in that case uh then because I don't know when it's actually talking versus when you have used in the state patch I'm gonna need you to like explicitly tell me um, so we're gonna Basically, I want to like queue up and exercise out of time if that makes sense So we're gonna I'm gonna introduce you today to a few different ways to navigate a webpage using a screen reader The first one that we're gonna do is um just simply tapping right this is no different from When you are just tapping for keyboard navigation, right But the sun you'll have a screen reader just also telling you some things So all of your shortcuts like all of your arrow keys and space bars and enters and stuff like that your tabs your shift tabs It's all the same just now we have a screen reader
But the sun you'll have a screen reader just also telling you some things So all of your shortcuts like all of your arrow keys and space bars and enters and stuff like that your tabs your shift tabs It's all the same just now we have a screen reader So let's go ahead and do that for a bit It is definitely Like it's reading it out loud. It just read that um It is which Google Chrome Profile I'm using and then I'm in a text box
So let's go ahead and do that for a bit It is definitely Like it's reading it out loud. It just read that um It is which Google Chrome Profile I'm using and then I'm in a text box Yeah Ooh to display a list of options press control option space Oh It I'm glad that I can see this at the same time because it is very confusing At least If I would just listening without the context of it
Yeah Ooh to display a list of options press control option space Oh It I'm glad that I can see this at the same time because it is very confusing At least If I would just listening without the context of it Yeah, but yeah, I feel like if it were somebody that Maybe a bit more experienced with not being able to see it that they would be able to get used to the way it's just Yes, and and you know real day-to-day users of screen readers will have this like much faster than you know You or I might when when testing um and that's a thing to call out like you just get more use to this And you can better discern what what's being said additionally some folks aren't hearing their screen reader allowed Rather, they're using a peripheral called a refreshable braille display This is a row of like braille dots that like raise or lower based on what the screen reader is reading out um And so uh, yeah, some people are like aren't even hearing this allowed
Yeah, but yeah, I feel like if it were somebody that Maybe a bit more experienced with not being able to see it that they would be able to get used to the way it's just Yes, and and you know real day-to-day users of screen readers will have this like much faster than you know You or I might when when testing um and that's a thing to call out like you just get more use to this And you can better discern what what's being said additionally some folks aren't hearing their screen reader allowed Rather, they're using a peripheral called a refreshable braille display This is a row of like braille dots that like raise or lower based on what the screen reader is reading out um And so uh, yeah, some people are like aren't even hearing this allowed They're just like they're feeling it Hmm So interesting um How would they be able to feel it then is That's something that's like a different device. Yeah
They're just like they're feeling it Hmm So interesting um How would they be able to feel it then is That's something that's like a different device. Yeah Yeah. Yeah, it's so I said peripheral so that's like it's it's a device Like it's a piece of hardware you'd plug into your computer and um Yeah, the dots would raise or lower so It's really cool
Yeah. Yeah, it's so I said peripheral so that's like it's it's a device Like it's a piece of hardware you'd plug into your computer and um Yeah, the dots would raise or lower so It's really cool I want to say like a quarter of day-end day-out screen reader users use refreshable braille displays So it's not an insignificant amount by any stretch Me there we go Braille oh, actually there we go Whoa You It's definitely not Very friendly on Google Okay, um, I say that as it like won't let you scroll and highlight something else
I want to say like a quarter of day-end day-out screen reader users use refreshable braille displays So it's not an insignificant amount by any stretch Me there we go Braille oh, actually there we go Whoa You It's definitely not Very friendly on Google Okay, um, I say that as it like won't let you scroll and highlight something else It was just uh pulling it back up here Yeah, like I was wanting to scroll and then like click on something I wouldn't even go down here. It just kept pulling it back up to here and it wasn't um And I have the same type of thing happened to me before on voice detects too
It was just uh pulling it back up here Yeah, like I was wanting to scroll and then like click on something I wouldn't even go down here. It just kept pulling it back up to here and it wasn't um And I have the same type of thing happened to me before on voice detects too Yeah Absolutely um So okay, so that's um that the kind of tabbing that you saw that moving the focus um the Again, focus is where your your cursor basically is like your keyboard cursor
Yeah Absolutely um So okay, so that's um that the kind of tabbing that you saw that moving the focus um the Again, focus is where your your cursor basically is like your keyboard cursor It's the same for A screen reader now Remember that focus is only for interactive things um things actually even specifically focus is really only for things that you can interact with with your keyboard Like the idea is it's whatever element would start receiving keyboard events But anything you can do with your mouse you should be able to do with your keyboard and so therefore Your like it we could broadly broadly speaking say that a focus goes to interactive things But if you think about it like You're gonna miss content on this page if the only thing you can do is go between interactive elements, right
It's the same for A screen reader now Remember that focus is only for interactive things um things actually even specifically focus is really only for things that you can interact with with your keyboard Like the idea is it's whatever element would start receiving keyboard events But anything you can do with your mouse you should be able to do with your keyboard and so therefore Your like it we could broadly broadly speaking say that a focus goes to interactive things But if you think about it like You're gonna miss content on this page if the only thing you can do is go between interactive elements, right You could go to the links, but you can't read the rest of the paragraph
You could go to the links, but you can't read the rest of the paragraph You can't read the heading for instance Right So we need ways to access anything on our page static content interactive content stuff like that, right
You can't read the heading for instance Right So we need ways to access anything on our page static content interactive content stuff like that, right So the next screen reader navigation mode I'm going to introduce to you is called the virtual cursor Um, and here's how you're going to do this um when you turn your screen reader back on Uh, you'll just kind of click into the page once uh, you might I find I sometimes have to like highlight the text Um a bit or like highlight a piece of text to get started, but then um you'll do control Option and then the left and right arrow keys So Which ones again Control option and then the left and right arrow keys
So the next screen reader navigation mode I'm going to introduce to you is called the virtual cursor Um, and here's how you're going to do this um when you turn your screen reader back on Uh, you'll just kind of click into the page once uh, you might I find I sometimes have to like highlight the text Um a bit or like highlight a piece of text to get started, but then um you'll do control Option and then the left and right arrow keys So Which ones again Control option and then the left and right arrow keys So you're holding down control and option and then you're going to use like both of them uh Control and option and then you'll use the left and right keys Um, is it dinging at you? Yeah, I do Yeah, you're your virtual cursor get trapped in a radio group
So you're holding down control and option and then you're going to use like both of them uh Control and option and then you'll use the left and right keys Um, is it dinging at you? Yeah, I do Yeah, you're your virtual cursor get trapped in a radio group I to to get around this I usually start by highlighting a little piece of text or something like that um Sorry, say that one more time. Oh you get to get out of that you get I usually just like highlight a piece of text with my mouse or something like that um, and that usually gets me Yeah, okay
I to to get around this I usually start by highlighting a little piece of text or something like that um Sorry, say that one more time. Oh you get to get out of that you get I usually just like highlight a piece of text with my mouse or something like that um, and that usually gets me Yeah, okay Now let's try control option arrow keys Oh You Okay, that was fun
Now let's try control option arrow keys Oh You Okay, that was fun Yeah, but you can imagine that if this if you were reading something bigger right like a whole blog or a news article or something like that That'd be kind of a convenient right to have to keep like progressing I actually want to try this now Okay I encourage that Yeah, okay, okay, let's see You Know you guys can't hear this
Yeah, but you can imagine that if this if you were reading something bigger right like a whole blog or a news article or something like that That'd be kind of a convenient right to have to keep like progressing I actually want to try this now Okay I encourage that Yeah, okay, okay, let's see You Know you guys can't hear this I'm I'm getting there. I'm getting there You're good So uh It reading the title of um Of this post that I made is Uh star star what is a devril what is an avocado avocado avocado avocado Yeah, so this is I love it
I'm I'm getting there. I'm getting there You're good So uh It reading the title of um Of this post that I made is Uh star star what is a devril what is an avocado avocado avocado avocado Yeah, so this is I love it Yeah, well, so um, but this speaks to a bit of like the user experience of using a screen reader right because like I don't want to say don't use emojis, right um, but If a screen reader announces emojis like it can be it can really clutter up the experience, right
Yeah, well, so um, but this speaks to a bit of like the user experience of using a screen reader right because like I don't want to say don't use emojis, right um, but If a screen reader announces emojis like it can be it can really clutter up the experience, right And so That's why we're where folks will advise like find a way to like cut down on emoji usage Um don't don't have a whole wall of emojis because that could be an absolute pain to get through, right
And so That's why we're where folks will advise like find a way to like cut down on emoji usage Um don't don't have a whole wall of emojis because that could be an absolute pain to get through, right Um You know in this case at star star what is a devril and what's with the avocados avocado avocado avocado and Maybe as far as screen reader users are concerned like you could have been fine with just simply avocado at the end, you know Yeah, and it's interesting that I did the stars because that was And this is probably my need to look at the article anyway
Um You know in this case at star star what is a devril and what's with the avocados avocado avocado avocado and Maybe as far as screen reader users are concerned like you could have been fine with just simply avocado at the end, you know Yeah, and it's interesting that I did the stars because that was And this is probably my need to look at the article anyway It should be um bolded Hmm or yeah, I think it's bolded or title or something and it could have been just when I imported it
It should be um bolded Hmm or yeah, I think it's bolded or title or something and it could have been just when I imported it I didn't realize it and um It definitely is something that I see the Like only doing like a few Yeah, because like even doing this if it says avocado Huh, but I think it's also like I like that thing though. I like the claps. What happens if I um I'm switching screens now
I didn't realize it and um It definitely is something that I see the Like only doing like a few Yeah, because like even doing this if it says avocado Huh, but I think it's also like I like that thing though. I like the claps. What happens if I um I'm switching screens now Okay, I select over here What do you think is gonna happen Yeah, I don't know how streaming art is on accessibility I don't Okay, oh hello
Okay, I select over here What do you think is gonna happen Yeah, I don't know how streaming art is on accessibility I don't Okay, oh hello I yeah, I don't actually know where your cursor is uh do you want me to spoil it for you
I yeah, I don't actually know where your cursor is uh do you want me to spoil it for you It doesn't actually um Just like oh, thank you um it makes it hard to talk and Think at the same time um It doesn't and what I was trying to see if it would do is read that comment And it would not read the comment even highlighting it um I was I ended up making my screen go um Full screen because I was trying to see if I can make it um By like showing it if it did it and that's very interesting to think about how not all applications are Accessible yeah, no, absolutely um So as far as and and do you want to put Anthony's comment on the screen again so we can kind of talk through this Uh, I am pretty sure that the way that this announces is hand clapping hands don't clapping hands don't clapping hands this uh Sorry, I think I missed the do do clapping hands uh this clapping hands thing now things get even worse if you um Specified like a skin tone modifier for the emojis because that's gonna be um I think that would be and clapping hands with white skin tone modifier don't clapping hands with white skin tone modifier Something like that like hugely hugely cluttered interesting Oh wow Right, so you can see how instantly what what you know is cute for Those of us who are cited and don't have to use a screen reader to Like that like that like that's cute, right
It doesn't actually um Just like oh, thank you um it makes it hard to talk and Think at the same time um It doesn't and what I was trying to see if it would do is read that comment And it would not read the comment even highlighting it um I was I ended up making my screen go um Full screen because I was trying to see if I can make it um By like showing it if it did it and that's very interesting to think about how not all applications are Accessible yeah, no, absolutely um So as far as and and do you want to put Anthony's comment on the screen again so we can kind of talk through this Uh, I am pretty sure that the way that this announces is hand clapping hands don't clapping hands don't clapping hands this uh Sorry, I think I missed the do do clapping hands uh this clapping hands thing now things get even worse if you um Specified like a skin tone modifier for the emojis because that's gonna be um I think that would be and clapping hands with white skin tone modifier don't clapping hands with white skin tone modifier Something like that like hugely hugely cluttered interesting Oh wow Right, so you can see how instantly what what you know is cute for Those of us who are cited and don't have to use a screen reader to Like that like that like that's cute, right But it's introduced so much clutter Clutter to the point like to the fact where it becomes like very hard to actually decipher what's being said um so Yeah, it's Perhaps a more Accessible uh version of that meme could have involved just putting like one clapping emoji at the like either at the beginning or at the end Maybe at both right yeah um So yeah um interesting
But it's introduced so much clutter Clutter to the point like to the fact where it becomes like very hard to actually decipher what's being said um so Yeah, it's Perhaps a more Accessible uh version of that meme could have involved just putting like one clapping emoji at the like either at the beginning or at the end Maybe at both right yeah um So yeah um interesting I'm This is making me think a lot about like and you and I talked about this a bit on our very first stream of A screen reader versus uh text to speech yeah and Even text to speech speeches have a hard time with emojis and yet It's like how Oh, this is so complicated
I'm This is making me think a lot about like and you and I talked about this a bit on our very first stream of A screen reader versus uh text to speech yeah and Even text to speech speeches have a hard time with emojis and yet It's like how Oh, this is so complicated I'm I'm torn that and I really do love emojis so I like them too, right? So I think I think the answer is Uh like it's not don't use emojis
I'm I'm torn that and I really do love emojis so I like them too, right? So I think I think the answer is Uh like it's not don't use emojis It's use emojis in moderation Yeah Which you know is maybe disheartening to like here, but I've barely said means that like we're not introducing gobs of clutter to a screen reader user's experience Yes Um and and i want to like express that i use emojis i tweet out emojis like i include them in my semantics announcements, right
It's use emojis in moderation Yeah Which you know is maybe disheartening to like here, but I've barely said means that like we're not introducing gobs of clutter to a screen reader user's experience Yes Um and and i want to like express that i use emojis i tweet out emojis like i include them in my semantics announcements, right Like this is absolutely not me putting the ban hammer down putting the kebash down I know because you used a good emoji that i want to start using for the location
Like this is absolutely not me putting the ban hammer down putting the kebash down I know because you used a good emoji that i want to start using for the location I was gonna tell you that I was like i that's about its practice
I was gonna tell you that I was like i that's about its practice I got to use that um But I can see how It's just making me think like it's just kind of crazy how when you don't realize these things just to be very cognizant about them um and so A lot of folks aren't aware of this and so a lot of the like trending memes on twitter are very emoji centric Like a while back there was a meme you you probably saw this one the red flags meme on twitter Okay, so the idea would be like um You Describe a behavior that you find problematic in some way and then afterwards you would fill the rest of the tweet Whatever remains in your character limit with red flag emojis
I got to use that um But I can see how It's just making me think like it's just kind of crazy how when you don't realize these things just to be very cognizant about them um and so A lot of folks aren't aware of this and so a lot of the like trending memes on twitter are very emoji centric Like a while back there was a meme you you probably saw this one the red flags meme on twitter Okay, so the idea would be like um You Describe a behavior that you find problematic in some way and then afterwards you would fill the rest of the tweet Whatever remains in your character limit with red flag emojis Ew Um, so it's like it's like you know when uh When they use tight script instead of java script red flag red flag red flag red flag for instance um But the issue is that um screen readers first of all that's a ton of emojis tons of clutter right and and these tweets were everywhere but second of all There's nothing in the computer that says that that's Specifically supposed to be a red flag emoji in fact the official name was like triangular flag on post And so it wasn't even clear that was supposed to be a red flag It was you know, it would be like when they use type script instead of java script triangular flag on post triangular flag on post triangular flag on post triangular flag on post you know um and so A lot of twitter memes are emojis centric in a way that Increased clutter and don't even really help in comprehension of what is actually supposed to be referred to my hello hello and Then Yes, like now one day a video or a speech or a blog something a one-day idea for you been of screen reader versus text to speak I gotcha Because I would watch that and I think that's something that I would Share a lot about and I say it
Ew Um, so it's like it's like you know when uh When they use tight script instead of java script red flag red flag red flag red flag for instance um But the issue is that um screen readers first of all that's a ton of emojis tons of clutter right and and these tweets were everywhere but second of all There's nothing in the computer that says that that's Specifically supposed to be a red flag emoji in fact the official name was like triangular flag on post And so it wasn't even clear that was supposed to be a red flag It was you know, it would be like when they use type script instead of java script triangular flag on post triangular flag on post triangular flag on post triangular flag on post you know um and so A lot of twitter memes are emojis centric in a way that Increased clutter and don't even really help in comprehension of what is actually supposed to be referred to my hello hello and Then Yes, like now one day a video or a speech or a blog something a one-day idea for you been of screen reader versus text to speak I gotcha Because I would watch that and I think that's something that I would Share a lot about and I say it I think this is a big and I would love a call out on this like I think it's something that when these ideas pop up for me. I'm like
I think this is a big and I would love a call out on this like I think it's something that when these ideas pop up for me. I'm like I'm like. Oh, let me share it with a person that is like Does this like this is their jam Because I'm like I can write it, you know, it's something I I'd be very curious about but it's not gonna have the same impact Then somebody that's like in that space
I'm like. Oh, let me share it with a person that is like Does this like this is their jam Because I'm like I can write it, you know, it's something I I'd be very curious about but it's not gonna have the same impact Then somebody that's like in that space Sure So I'm curious like how that works Yeah, well, so maybe we can continue our exploration of screen reader sent So one of the things that it's been doing is as you navigate to different things on the page It'll tell you what kind of thing that is right and that itself is a key difference between Screen readers and Texas Beach where Texas Beach will just say submit but a screen reader will tell you it's a submit button for instance Or that's right here is a link and so Yeah, so we had just finished Kind of talking about the virtual cursor But I wanted to give you a kind of shortcut so that you wouldn't have to keep like control option arrowing throughout the page And this is what we're going to call continuous reading mode and so continuous reading mode is um Control option a so let's go ahead and turn turn voice over back on and then put your cursor somewhere and do control option a I have to turn it back on yep The When you said control option a that's correct Oh Oh, I like this Yeah Tell me more um It's it's definitely something that So to do it as a comparison I use an app uh that's text to speech Uh, called natural reader I believe and I do like it but it doesn't always know where to select and Well a lot of times like read this and then skip down here Mm-hmm It makes it really difficult because for example, I Go I build all of mine in notion and um When I was going through here and doing it with text to speech it won't read the first line So I put a random first line here so that way when I'm listening it back to myself to make sure that I'm not missing something Because I am really dyslexic That it's reading the first paragraph So So screen readers are typically used by people who are blind or low vision by have also heard of screen readers Not even text to speech screen readers being used by dyslexic people as well for very similar reasons So just being able to like read content allowed and get get like all the information about links and stuff like that This may be something worth considering for you if you find that this is working better than your current text Speech tools Yeah, because I do really like the text to speech and the Uh if our comment about emojis has really made me think about emojis And the fact that I do use them as my bullet points a lot But at the same time hearing how they're describing the screen reader Uh, or like the emoji itself
Sure So I'm curious like how that works Yeah, well, so maybe we can continue our exploration of screen reader sent So one of the things that it's been doing is as you navigate to different things on the page It'll tell you what kind of thing that is right and that itself is a key difference between Screen readers and Texas Beach where Texas Beach will just say submit but a screen reader will tell you it's a submit button for instance Or that's right here is a link and so Yeah, so we had just finished Kind of talking about the virtual cursor But I wanted to give you a kind of shortcut so that you wouldn't have to keep like control option arrowing throughout the page And this is what we're going to call continuous reading mode and so continuous reading mode is um Control option a so let's go ahead and turn turn voice over back on and then put your cursor somewhere and do control option a I have to turn it back on yep The When you said control option a that's correct Oh Oh, I like this Yeah Tell me more um It's it's definitely something that So to do it as a comparison I use an app uh that's text to speech Uh, called natural reader I believe and I do like it but it doesn't always know where to select and Well a lot of times like read this and then skip down here Mm-hmm It makes it really difficult because for example, I Go I build all of mine in notion and um When I was going through here and doing it with text to speech it won't read the first line So I put a random first line here so that way when I'm listening it back to myself to make sure that I'm not missing something Because I am really dyslexic That it's reading the first paragraph So So screen readers are typically used by people who are blind or low vision by have also heard of screen readers Not even text to speech screen readers being used by dyslexic people as well for very similar reasons So just being able to like read content allowed and get get like all the information about links and stuff like that This may be something worth considering for you if you find that this is working better than your current text Speech tools Yeah, because I do really like the text to speech and the Uh if our comment about emojis has really made me think about emojis And the fact that I do use them as my bullet points a lot But at the same time hearing how they're describing the screen reader Uh, or like the emoji itself It's like okay cool How are like Is that going to make a big impact if it's not the exact same visual representation sure So like some of them like the um This emoji is considered tears of joy Whereas that's what it's called and I was like I've never seen anyone use that of tears of joy So it's been like a laffy emoji right so In my mind and I'd be curious for people that experience this if there are if Context how much context goes into it and how often they someone may work on Consuming this content or if they skip through content like what is that user experience like Yeah, and a lot of emojis are very contextual
It's like okay cool How are like Is that going to make a big impact if it's not the exact same visual representation sure So like some of them like the um This emoji is considered tears of joy Whereas that's what it's called and I was like I've never seen anyone use that of tears of joy So it's been like a laffy emoji right so In my mind and I'd be curious for people that experience this if there are if Context how much context goes into it and how often they someone may work on Consuming this content or if they skip through content like what is that user experience like Yeah, and a lot of emojis are very contextual There's one example um there's like a there's one emoji that depicts a face that's like um blowing steam out of their nose um and So Many people in the west will use that as like an anger emoji um But This is actually if you look at like the name of the emoji It's like determined face because the notion of like having like seem like uh Steam coming out your your nose um in Japan from what I understand and Japan is where like the first set of emojis came from like that's kind of the standard Depiction of determination and so like People are using a thing like an emoji that looks a certain way In a way that doesn't quite connect to the underlying name of the emoji And there's cultural connotations there too
There's one example um there's like a there's one emoji that depicts a face that's like um blowing steam out of their nose um and So Many people in the west will use that as like an anger emoji um But This is actually if you look at like the name of the emoji It's like determined face because the notion of like having like seem like uh Steam coming out your your nose um in Japan from what I understand and Japan is where like the first set of emojis came from like that's kind of the standard Depiction of determination and so like People are using a thing like an emoji that looks a certain way In a way that doesn't quite connect to the underlying name of the emoji And there's cultural connotations there too So extremely to your users going to hear like determine face Um, which isn't quite the same as like face that's like steaming with anger Yes That's the one yes, that's the one I have um interesting Interesting this is so fascinating and I know we're getting close on time and I just want to say that Then I feel like you need to be a monthly visitor because you just teach us so much about As we're developing things like and it's not just like a developer aspect of it I feel like accessibility is something we need to think about Throughout everything that we're building even as it comes down to like apis
So extremely to your users going to hear like determine face Um, which isn't quite the same as like face that's like steaming with anger Yes That's the one yes, that's the one I have um interesting Interesting this is so fascinating and I know we're getting close on time and I just want to say that Then I feel like you need to be a monthly visitor because you just teach us so much about As we're developing things like and it's not just like a developer aspect of it I feel like accessibility is something we need to think about Throughout everything that we're building even as it comes down to like apis Yeah So now I'm like mineboggled again I'm down to be a monthly guest But um with this little bit of time we've got can I show you one more thing with screen readers
Yeah So now I'm like mineboggled again I'm down to be a monthly guest But um with this little bit of time we've got can I show you one more thing with screen readers Yes And then you know, we'll we'll definitely we'll I think in months to come we'll start talking a lot more about semantic HTML semantic markup because I think that's a huge part of a strong foundation for accessibility, but Let's go back to the dev2 page And and we can use that as our grounds here
Yes And then you know, we'll we'll definitely we'll I think in months to come we'll start talking a lot more about semantic HTML semantic markup because I think that's a huge part of a strong foundation for accessibility, but Let's go back to the dev2 page And and we can use that as our grounds here So What I'm about to introduce you to In voiceover, it's a feature called the rotor Different screen readers all have their own implementations for something like this I think that voiceovers is the easiest to use especially for us cited testers But the idea is it's going to be a way to navigate between different elements of a similar type um And so that could be like going from heading to heading or link to link button to button And so in jaws and vda narrator those are other screen readers They all have keyboard shortcuts for this But I find that voiceovers is going to be the easiest Because it packs everything into one nice easy shortcut So the way we're going to do this is we're going to turn voiceover back on and then you're going to do control option you Oh, oh Uh Go ahead and do the up and down arrow keys a few times Hi Yeah, hello Sorry, yeah, oh go ahead and go ahead and hit up and down a few times Okay So yeah, you're you're skipping through the page Going from link to link Sorry one more time you're skipping from the page going from link to link right Um, yes, so you can imagine you know if if someone's included a bunch of links that are all called click here or read more Well, this is a very valid way to navigate the page that is completely taking those links out of context It is And so this is one of the reason that Like accessibility advocates will recommend that you keep your links like very like specific and to the point right like and descriptive Your links should describe where they go because in a mode like this you don't know where they're going to go You don't even know the surrounding context So on that note If I scroll all the way down if I were to put this link if in where uh What's with the avocado And linked it there they would at least know that that link has something to do with Yeah, it's with the avocado
So What I'm about to introduce you to In voiceover, it's a feature called the rotor Different screen readers all have their own implementations for something like this I think that voiceovers is the easiest to use especially for us cited testers But the idea is it's going to be a way to navigate between different elements of a similar type um And so that could be like going from heading to heading or link to link button to button And so in jaws and vda narrator those are other screen readers They all have keyboard shortcuts for this But I find that voiceovers is going to be the easiest Because it packs everything into one nice easy shortcut So the way we're going to do this is we're going to turn voiceover back on and then you're going to do control option you Oh, oh Uh Go ahead and do the up and down arrow keys a few times Hi Yeah, hello Sorry, yeah, oh go ahead and go ahead and hit up and down a few times Okay So yeah, you're you're skipping through the page Going from link to link Sorry one more time you're skipping from the page going from link to link right Um, yes, so you can imagine you know if if someone's included a bunch of links that are all called click here or read more Well, this is a very valid way to navigate the page that is completely taking those links out of context It is And so this is one of the reason that Like accessibility advocates will recommend that you keep your links like very like specific and to the point right like and descriptive Your links should describe where they go because in a mode like this you don't know where they're going to go You don't even know the surrounding context So on that note If I scroll all the way down if I were to put this link if in where uh What's with the avocado And linked it there they would at least know that that link has something to do with Yeah, it's with the avocado Yeah Instead of click here then Click here just would mean we have no idea But it is like we're actually embedded with the text of it
Yeah Instead of click here then Click here just would mean we have no idea But it is like we're actually embedded with the text of it Yeah Let's real quick hop back into the voiceover and hit hit the left and right arrow keys Um to go to different panels and the panel that I want to especially highlight is the headings panel Okay, and it's Control option you yeah Nice here we go So uh can you hear me by the way Yeah Can you hear me
Yeah Let's real quick hop back into the voiceover and hit hit the left and right arrow keys Um to go to different panels and the panel that I want to especially highlight is the headings panel Okay, and it's Control option you yeah Nice here we go So uh can you hear me by the way Yeah Can you hear me Yep awesome
Yep awesome So yeah, what this is doing is this is giving us all of our H1s through H6s on the page and Oh, that's cool Yeah, and it even tells you which heading level right so the one that your cursor is on right now is an H1 Have you word to go down one it would take you to do an H2 And Hmm I would say the only thing that especially if people are Having a hard time with visualization, but Can still see is it would be cool if it scroll to where it is on the page sure Um, yeah, and this is so dope Yeah, yeah, uh, you could hit enter by the way if you want to have it just like if you want to close the rotor and scroll down to it Um, and so yeah now we're saying to see how the the elements that we use impact How this experience is presented to assistive technology right um, and so uh, Full to our not cited um Like you know you and I were cited if we're looking at a page and we want to get what like get a piece of information on that page We might skim through the page until we find a heading that seems roughly right and then start reading more closely But screen reader when you just use the virtual cursor is inherently um Uh linear right, uh, and so this allows this is effectively giving screen reader users that same skimming functionality So yeah Unfortunately, I know you have to jump thank you Thank you and we look forward to having you on again soon and bye everyone
So yeah, what this is doing is this is giving us all of our H1s through H6s on the page and Oh, that's cool Yeah, and it even tells you which heading level right so the one that your cursor is on right now is an H1 Have you word to go down one it would take you to do an H2 And Hmm I would say the only thing that especially if people are Having a hard time with visualization, but Can still see is it would be cool if it scroll to where it is on the page sure Um, yeah, and this is so dope Yeah, yeah, uh, you could hit enter by the way if you want to have it just like if you want to close the rotor and scroll down to it Um, and so yeah now we're saying to see how the the elements that we use impact How this experience is presented to assistive technology right um, and so uh, Full to our not cited um Like you know you and I were cited if we're looking at a page and we want to get what like get a piece of information on that page We might skim through the page until we find a heading that seems roughly right and then start reading more closely But screen reader when you just use the virtual cursor is inherently um Uh linear right, uh, and so this allows this is effectively giving screen reader users that same skimming functionality So yeah Unfortunately, I know you have to jump thank you Thank you and we look forward to having you on again soon and bye everyone I all
I all
