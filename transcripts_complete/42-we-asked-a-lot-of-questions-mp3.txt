From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show with the answer to the ultimate question of podcasting, the podiverse, and every pod. This episode is brought to you by Issue. I'm Jay and with me is the superb, not owl, but unicorn, Kathy Campbell. Hi, Kathy. Hi, Jay. I'm super excited to be here, as always, and ready for the big super game full of puppies with the halftime show of kittens. Yeah, we talked about how big of a fan that Mrs. Soup is of the game that they literally named after her. If you want to hear more about that, then you should become a superconductor. We'll talk about more- Hey, Jay, what's a superconductor? Okay, I was going to say we'll talk about that later. I know, but then it talks in our shout out. Let's do it now. Let's throw caution to the wind and break up our pattern of traditional layout and just throw it in now. Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy. I don't know where I got this voice from and I'm getting rid of it immediately, but we make plans. I know. You just throw them out. Okay. All right. Hi, everyone. Superconductor is our new special thing? Words? Show? Our new membership opportunity? Our new membership show. Show. There we go. Yes. Where you get to hear more of this, this goofiness, whatever this is. You get to have the pre-show, post-show. You get no ads, but also you get the opportunity to do some superconducting of work. That's right. get another opportunity to hang out in a more closely bound session with both and or either Kathy and Jay, Kathy and or Jay, Jay and or Kathy and sometimes special guests where we just figure it out and do stuff. Sometimes figuring it out means working on our connection. Sometimes figuring it out means doing that thing that we've been waiting to do for a long time. Sometimes figuring it out just means answering questions or talking about the upcoming show. Never. Or just goofing off or learning what a coder is. So, yes, shout out to all the people that came to our very first superconducting co-working session where we learned that we have a lot of coders and not every coder involves computer programming. So, that was a blast. I had so much fun. Can't wait to do it again. And guess what? We're doing it again next Tuesday. That's right. Tuesday, February the 14th. That's Valentine's Day. So, yeah, you can celebrate Valentine's Day with us and superco-working by going to I'mASuperconductor.com. That is letter I, letter M, Asuperconductor.com and become a member of Conduit. By the way, you can also support us by wearing a super awesome superconductor shirt or hoodie. Or you can just rock that Conduit logo in a variety of colors. Or you can throw a tire check sticker onto your desk or your computer or your best friend's back. Or a notebook. Or a notebook, wherever you want to put it. You can go to uconnwearit.com to see that there. But Kathy, did you have any shout outs? Yeah, I have one very special shout out to my break room friends who helped me with my connection, which I don't know if it's time to do that connection, but I wanted to thank everyone in that channel. That really helped me go through the significant pros and cons and helped me make a decision. Speaking of decisions, I think we should check our connections. Zap! So, Kathy, what was that decision that you made? So I am getting braces and I needed to decide if I wanted to do Invisalign or traditional. And I had a whole list of both sides and I have decided that I'm going to do Invisalign and see if it works. How it works with my jaw pain and all of that fun stuff. And I'm very excited. So as soon as my kid gets the teeth removed that they need to, we are going to schedule our braces appointments together. Nice. I was hoping you would go for the full cranial headwear option. No, thankfully, my first two rounds of braces when I was young fixed the back half of my teeth. So apparently they're perfectly lined up. So we're good. I don't need to adjust my jaw at all. So you went with two rounds. I just went with one really long one. It was supposed to be like four years. I had like three and a half years total. Oh, I had like seven. Oh, my gosh. I think from like, eventually we just gave up and we're like, we're done with this. Yeah, but your teeth are great. I mean, yeah, there's still a little bit of crowding, but well, you know, every time I go to the dentist, they're like, you know, braces are an option. I was like, oh, no, braces are a lifestyle. Oh, my goodness. So maybe I'm in such a good mood and being so jovial and playful with all of this, because my connection was to keep up with the folks, keep up with some folks that I've been wanting to do a better job with of talking to. Funny enough, this also just happened to coincide that it was my dad's birthday last week. So I actually after I was someone texted me to remind me, I remembered. Yeah. And we had a great conversation. And then I've also been doing a really good job of talking with my family back home. For those that don't know, my my younger sister and I are about 15 years apart, which if you do the math, she just became an adult and I have been an adult for some time. And, you know, it's been good, you know, keeping up with her and, you know, being able to provide that good older brother and also adulting is hard wisdom. And then also my mom just is in the she's in the process of moving, which is like really, really fun. We're doing a lot. So there's a lot of stuff happening. And I've been trying to keep up with it. And I actually did. I took some concerted effort to keep up with everybody. And I will say it actually has really been nice. Excellent. Is this one of those connections that you think you are going to continue on after? Oh, no, there's no chance this is way too much energy. I can't wait to just drop. No, I don't. I don't know. It's I think I want to make it a habit so that I don't have to be as. Conscious of like stop what you're doing. Call this person like it's it's more like I want it to just be like, oh, hey, I haven't talked to this person in a couple of days or, you know, or maybe, oh, it's been a week. Let me reach out to them really quick. Excellent. What about our conductors? Oh, man, we had so many great connection checks this episode or this fortnight from Dan, our civil engineer of the show. Me and my wife decided on the perfect colors for the house, and we enjoyed some downtime to try and help with our stress. That sounds incredible. So jealous. Our soprano of the show, Deborah, says connection check green checkmark took the week off. Yes. After my radiation treatments finished and successfully said no to many meetings on the days I was out, my burns have mostly healed and I'm feeling back to normal. I'm so glad to hear that, and I'm so glad to hear that everything is going well after your treatments. Our blue dragon of the show, Sky, has a blue heart. Glad to be using Obsidian as my PKM. It's got a few great features which have proven useful for both creative projects and my jobby job. That's amazing when you find something that actually does what you want it to do and it works with your brain. I'm so happy for you. Absolutely. A new conductor alert. First connection check. We got a green tree on this one. First connection check on the green tree from Logang. Hi, Logang. We need an of the show for you. If you want to give us another show, please do in the next one. But yes, their connection check was green tree. Join the discord. Hey, nailed it. Baby, I love it. I love it. I hope that the discord has been warm and welcoming and all of those amazing good feelings that we get when we hang out in our discord. By the way, if you want to hang out in the discord, you should go to letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor.com and become a member there. And that is one of the perks you also get from becoming a superconductor. What about our reader of the show? Yeah, our reader of the show, Adam, has a green book. I finished building the feature at work. There were some bugs, but I was able to fix them quickly. I mean, I think it would be a miracle if there were no bugs. So the fact that there were just some and you were able to fix them quickly sounds like a perfect launch to me. Our shark of the show, Chris, says connection check, green check mark. I got the desk cleaned off and organized for now. Oh, man, I watched this. OK, I'm a nerd and I watch these like, look at my office desk set up, blah, blah, blah. And then I look at it usually with my eyes rolling extremely hard. But there was one that I watched about like a cable is set up and stuff that involved using a drill. And any time I can provide destruction to a thing, you have my attention. So I think I, too, will also be cleaning my desk soon. But good job, Chris. Our nameless of the show, Robert, connection check, green circle, Valentine's vacation requested and approved. I was nervous sending the email, but thankfully I did it. Now I am looking forward to a staycation with my wife next week. I also bought the gifts for the holiday, but UPS has remained difficult and has not delivered anything to my house. The feud continues now, having heard some of this story in the discord, I am I cannot believe the ridiculousness that you're going through. Our choreographed parade is almost finished. I'm ready for the balloons to show up. But of course, they're lost from USPS. Long story short, I'm just very glad that you are going to take a staycation and that you fought like past your nerves for sending that email to take that break. Breaks are so important and I want to make sure that you do some more in the future. And our mudkip of the show says connection check, green checkmark. I moved everything over from reminders to OmniFocus and it's working great. Still don't think I'm using it to its full potential, but I'll only get more used to using it over time. OK, cool. I want to I want to first say great job in making the move. I want to provide an area of caution in terms of using something to its full potential. I think what you want to do is use it to your full potential, not the apps full potential. Use it. However, it's going to make you be the best at what you're doing, not necessarily trying to squeeze every single penny out of that purchase. Because trust me, as someone who has purchased way too many OmniSuite products, the trap that you fall into is I have spent all this money and I need to get every single cent's worth. And honestly, if it's working for you, that means it is doing what you paid for it to do. So good job on making that first step. I say use it, use it the way that you're going to use it best. Absolutely. And if you find that you're missing something, then you can Google and see how to get it to do what you want it to do. That's the best way to use any new tool for sure. Fo sho. Fo sho. All right. OK, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have regrets. It's fine because we're moving on to our Oracle of the show. So who has a red circle? I was going to meditate five times a week and I think I managed twice a week. I'll be trying again for my next connection. Listen, I would give you a yellow circle. I know we've had conversations in the past about what constitutes a red versus yellow versus green. And the fact of the matter is that you did two of those meditations, which is more than zero. I would say that a zero. Sorry. I would say that a red circle would be if you did none, but you did some. So well done. Let's take a moment and talk about our sponsor.

You know what was more important? 42. Oh, well, I was going to say the answer. Which is 42. I mean, you're not wrong. But you know what's more important than the answer? 42. Folks, you may be wondering, how did we get ourselves in this situation? Listen, I don't know. And I have so many regrets. I'm so sorry. Let's try this again, shall we? Javier, keep this in. Oh, actually, you were right on track because today's topic is the answer or getting to it. That is the question. Now that everybody has completely tuned out, sweet. We've been looking forward to episode 42 for so long because 41 episodes, exactly 41 episodes, which if you think about the conduit ness of it all, that is 41 conduits, which is 80 some odd weeks. So, yeah, we've been we've been waiting a long time to get to this episode. And that's because a lot of folks come to these podcasts looking for answers. In fact, the people that give us the least amount of stars often have the Oh, they're too silly. Me or Oh, they don't ever really solve the question of what's the best productivity tool to use me. I don't know why this person sounds like the mixture of the people from Whoville and the wizard behind the curtain. It almost sounds like a dark wing duck villain. Oh, that. I mean, OK. Now I'm intrigued to know who these people are. But I wanted to I wanted to like talk about this a little bit. And I wanted to talk to Kathy about it, because in my opinion, the answer is usually the second most important thing. What's really important is the journey to getting to that answer, which is why some of my favorite movies like world renowned Disney family movie Deadpool starts at near the end. And what we're really doing is we don't care about the resolution. What we care about is the meat and potatoes in the middle, which is how we got there. And Kathy, you are a business fricking professional. That's what people tell me. That's what people tell you. In your opinion, when you're working with, you know, these these people who are often too busy to enjoy the process of getting the results. Do you feel like that's why your role is so important, because you are you are the pathway to that answer, not just the the answer itself? Yeah, I feel like so often a lot of especially creative professionals or people that started a business to do one specific thing come to it knowing this is where I want to be. This is what needs to happen. I need to get paid. So I need invoices to be sent. But A, I don't want to do it. B, I don't want to spend the time doing it. C, I don't want to learn how to do it. D, the idea of writing down processes sounds terrible. E, I just want the money to show up. F, I'm going to stop now because I could go through the whole alphabet. But but the fact of the matter is, is that when you are running a business and this includes even if it's like you're running a team at the company that you're working at or running a family or whatever, as the leader, a lot of times you have to think of what the answer is, not necessarily the steps to get there. So in the morning, your kid needs to go to school on time. Period. Now, some days from experience, everything works great. The your child wakes up when their alarm goes off or you wake them up. Their lunch gets made. Their bag is packed. Their shoes are on and they're out the door before the bus arrives. Well, then other days. Anything could go wrong. And the fact of the matter is, is that it will go wrong and then more things tend to go wrong. And then you end up having to take your kid to school in your pajamas because they were running late and you were running late and it all just kind of discombob is discombobulate dis discombobulated. Yeah, that was really hard work to say for some reason. But I know when my kid was younger, having a checklist with little pictures helped. So they knew when I woke them up, first thing they had to do was get dressed and then they would go and brush their teeth and then they would go and make their lunch and like having these steps to remind them what to do made things easier. Obviously, it didn't fix everything all the time. But by having the smaller steps, that part of the journey. Made the destination easier. And I feel like a lot of times if we can figure out what our journey is or what the question really is or like how those steps to find that answer, we can actually find the answer in a way that's more so what we need as opposed to what we think we want. So I think one of the big things with this is I don't think many people want an answer. They want a solution. Yes. Because if the answer could not be the thing that that makes people happy, if, you know, the answer to I have to do my taxes is I have to do my taxes. Like it is taxes must get completed. Yeah. Yeah. Not I have to get my taxes, but taxes must get finished. Yes. Like you taxes must get submitted. And and the solution to I have to file my taxes is either I need to work with a professional, which means that sure, that might cost me some money, but it also might save me some time or save me some frustration. Or I might have to figure out which service like, you know, which service is going to be the right solution for me. I think what we really what we often forget is that anyone can provide an answer. But if you provide the wrong answer, even if the answer looks right, if it's wrong, you now have the potential to have multiple problems. And this is why we we don't put too much focus except for next episode, which is it's that time again, systems check time. But but every other show isn't necessarily about the answer that Jay and Kathy came up with for the meantime problem. It's what are some of the solutions that we can apply to solving multiple problems in the present and the future? Yeah, because a lot of times these issues will unfortunately happen again. Like the fact of the matter is, is that every year your taxes have to get done one way or the other. Every year, you don't want to have to sit down and make a spreadsheet of all of the options for taxes. That sounds exhausting. Who wants to do that? You're going to put it off. You're going to dread it even more. However, if you have a solution that involves hiring a company to do your taxes for you, so much easier to then say, oh, well, so and so does my taxes. You know, they'll reach out and let you know what you need to send, what the process is, whatever. Someone will send you the money. What the process is, whatever. Someone will hold your hand or you'll get the notification from TurboTax that says, hey, it's time to do your taxes and then just do it, get it done, move on. Whatever that journey to get that answer for getting your taxes done. Yes, you shouldn't just automatically do whatever you've done in the past. That's how we get stagnant. That's how, you know, issues arise, especially as programs and systems change and whatnot. But you do not need to start from scratch. And especially if that first time that you do it, if you have some sort of spreadsheet or, I don't know, an omnifocus task or obsidian document with links out or something. Like if you have the reasons why you're picking something, then when the time comes around that you have to do it again, you can maybe look at, oh, I chose this because of the price. Well, now the price is different. So I'm going to change over to this one that has better features for that same price. So keeping track of this stuff, whatever it is that you're doing can be really helpful for you in the present, but even more helpful for a future journey that you might have to take. I have a mentor at work that always tries to remind me to conserve my keystrokes. And what we mean by that is. Is the is the blog post that you write about how you did the thing going to save you time, energy and resources and resources and tuition. Yeah, all those all those tires. Then not writing about it, podcasting about it, talking about it, making that YouTube video about it and then running into that issue again in the future and having to search the Internet, which I mean, we know how reliable the Internet can be. And not find the solution that worked the last time. And it's it's so amazing to think about things from that perspective, even to the point where I've dabbled in the idea of like private podcasts for just me. That like is an audio log of little baby solutions that I've made of like, hey, here's how you do this thing. And, you know, not to not to make the world feel pity or anything, but like the last few weeks have been really hard on me because I've had flare ups of of an autoimmune issue that I have that one day might constrict me from talking, from typing, from doing all kinds of things. And the thing is, I don't know. But what I do know is that if I find those solutions, if I find the solutions inside the solutions, if I don't think about what is the answer, but more about like, OK, what did I what did I glean, which is one of my favorite words, what did I glean from this experience that could be applied in so many other problems? In the future, that is the real solution and not just the answer. Then how do I preserve that? Not just worry about, oh, well, I I figured out the problem so I can figure it out again. Right. Yeah, having having putting out the energy. Twice when you have to do it two times, instead of taking half the amount of time to make notes or document some sort of way that you did it will. Save so much time in the long run, even if it feels exhausting and possibly overwhelming when you do it a lot of times when I when I start working with a new client, it's really frustrating and scary for them to hand things over and especially difficult for them to possibly sit and say, OK, this is the process. Of how I do everything in my business. And so instead, a lot of times what I do is I have people. For a week, just write down what they're doing when they're doing it. And then the next week, I'll say, OK, I want you to video yourself doing this. Screen record, make sure your audio is hooked up and like talk it through as if you're explaining it to somebody that's sitting right next to you. And this lets them figure out what they're doing. And so much easier to hand things over to someone else, because you're like, oh, I already wrote down the systems. I did it verbally, just talking things through. But that record is really all you need to do. Like, that's fantastic. That's all you. That's it. That's exactly what I was going to say is, is that it it the benefit of that is that it helps you, but it could also help others. And I think the the thing that I've kind of lost in a lot of modern content and this is this is old man yells at at content creators or yells at algorithms in YouTube is I I actually enjoy the process like everyone knows that Bob Bob Ross is just witchcraft and wizardry. Like we we know that. But the thing that I like about watching Bob Ross, which if anyone hasn't ever seen some of my backgrounds or whatever, I enjoy a good Bob Ross. I have his energy drink, which I think is the least energetic energy drink ever. I haven't tried it. I want to save it. Might be worth something one day. Probably not. But it also looks kind of cool. But it could also look cool as an empty can. But then bugs get in there. Anyway, I'm rambling. The thing I like about what Bob Ross does is. His style of painting. Feels very chaotic in the moment. And results in something beautiful in the end. And it is done through a series of small and simple movements. It's it's always these like, hey, just let's just let's let's let's get wild. Let's, you know, make some big decisions. And the big decision is we're going to just sweep across in these little brushstrokes, these little brushstrokes, these little brushstrokes. And the thing is, no matter how bad of a painter you are, if you follow his steps, it may not come out looking exactly like Bob Ross's painting. But most of the time, it looks better than you thought it would. Yes. And and that's the thing I enjoy about, you know, focusing on the process and being able to dive into the process of why you did a thing. Or, you know, some of the videos that I make where it's like, hey, I just want to talk about why I did this. Not necessarily the fact that I did it. Hey, I did it. If you want to go check it out, that's cool. But more about the why, because if someone is listening to the the why part of it, it might allow them to say, oh, hey, I have a similar situation. And while Jay's answer may not be the answer that I particularly need in this moment, the mindset that he has is something that I haven't tried. And maybe that'll lead me to a solution to my problem. Yes. Yeah. That journey can sometimes take you to a destination or an answer that you never even imagined it could be. So so don't downplay that journey. Just an excitement to get the correct answer. I mean, this is something that in, you know, elementary school and middle school and high school, you learned in math. You had to show your work. And that's mainly so that you remember. How to do things, don't ask me how to do any math. They changed all the rules on math. It's all totally changed. It's all new. But that's fine, because my kid knows how and they're incredible. But I remember them coming home from school one day and they're like, oh, my gosh, I didn't. Even though I got all of the right answers, I failed my math test because I didn't write out the steps. And I'm like trying to explain, yes, this is very painful, especially for smart kids. This is annoying to have to write down all of these steps because you could do it in your head. But sometimes you got to play the game. Sometimes you have to go on that journey just to show the teacher that you know how to do it, but also so that it imprints in your head just a little bit more. So next time you get more complicated work, it can be easier. And I got a big sigh in my face, but, you know, it worked out. So I think what we're trying to say to wrap it up is be like that one math teacher. Getting the answer isn't important. What is important is showing your work. Hey, Kathy, what work are you going to show for the next conduit? Good question. Hi. I don't even know. I was so excited about the journey that I forgot about the answer to the question that you would ask. You know what? I think I am going to. Right, Dave? Like, really, really comes into the chat saying, what a smooth transition. Love it. And I'm like, yes, if only I was a better co-host and could think of my connection ahead of time and pick up the smooth transition when Jay left it, but I dropped it. I dropped it really hard. Oh, my gosh. Talk it out. Talk it out. Talk it out. I know. I know. So over the last week, I had a friend come and stay and we did a lot of cleaning in the house. A lot of boxes gone through multiple trips to Goodwill. Like, it was really refreshing. I am going to tackle two of the boxes behind my couch. They're big boxes and they're kind of scary, but I'm going to tackle them. And get either get rid of them or put things away. OK, OK. Two of the boxes. Yep. Not one. Nope. One's a red X. One's a red X. Nah, don't get. No, just kidding. One's an orange circle. OK, one. And then bonus bonus points for the second one. Yes. OK, I like it. I we talked about this before the pre-show. Sorry, superconductors. We can't we don't share every everything with I mean, we try to. I'm telling you about it now, right? But don't you mean sorry, non superconductors? This was talked about in the pre-show. No, this was talked about in the pre pre-show. Oh, that's right. It was. Yeah. So I have felt like I have been ill for like the past year. In fact, many people might remember a year ago, I was just getting back to the show after missing a couple of episodes because my voice was completely shot. And guess what? My voice is slightly shot. So, yeah, it's been a year. But we we were talking about this a little bit. And I jokingly said, you know, it's almost like when your doctor tells you to take a vitamin D supplement or to get some sunlight that like they actually know what they're talking about. So I'm my my my connection. And this is going to be an everyday thing. I'm going to even set an alarm. I'm going to set one of the nagging alarms and do that. Like you can't even you have to like, say, no, I did this. Otherwise, it's going to just keep reminding you. I mean, that's the hope anyways. Yeah, I'm going to take my vitamin D supplement every day for the next conduit. It literally will take one second. I'm going to do the smart thing. I'm going to make it a an easier thing to do. I'm going to put the jar of supplements right next on my on my nightstand there next to me while I'm sleeping so that when I wake up, the first thing I do in the morning is take a sip of my water and take my vitamin D supplement and start the day off knowing that I did the hardest thing to do, which was remember to take that stupid little pill that would probably make me feel better if I took it. Amazing. I'm proud of you. You know who I'm proud of? Our civil engineer of the show, Dan, who says for the next conduit, I want to work hard on the next few days so that we can dive feet first into Hogwarts legacy and take it all in. Butterbeers at the ready. I don't tell my wife this. I do enjoy a good butter beer. I give her a hard time about it because that's the kind of person I am. But I do enjoy a good butter beer. All right. A soprano of the show, Deborah.

Send your bag recommendations because I know some that got some really good style. Some Tom Benz out there, if you will. Our blue dragon of the show, blue dragon returns. OK. OK, Sky.
