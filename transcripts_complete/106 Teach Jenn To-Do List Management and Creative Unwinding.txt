Welcome to another episode of Teach Shandhaek and today is coming out with me because well I have a lot of shit to do. I have like 45 minutes to do it and yeah it's Tuesday so I wanted to hang out with you. And I need to figure out everything I'm doing on my list today is last week Roy helped me start my amazing to-do list and that being said I have to write down a lot of these processes that I'm super stuck on but also instead of actually getting started on this yesterday I decided it would be really fun to rearrange my office or living room. Like it's kind of both
Roy helped me start my amazing to-do list and that being said I have to write down a lot of these processes that I'm super stuck on but also instead of actually getting started on this yesterday I decided it would be really fun to rearrange my office or living room. Like it's kind of both So I'm in the front room. We have like a weird double living room type of situation so I set up my office in the front room and it used to be like one little cube of it and it very separated. Now I'm just taking up the entire thing and we have light in the background
So I'm in the front room. We have like a weird double living room type of situation so I set up my office in the front room and it used to be like one little cube of it and it very separated. Now I'm just taking up the entire thing and we have light in the background I have some books that I apparently cover up and yeah this is basically- I need to figure out my camera because I am setting it behind my computer now
I have some books that I apparently cover up and yeah this is basically- I need to figure out my camera because I am setting it behind my computer now Instead of like behind my monitors like on its own tripod instead of on the tripod on my desk that being said I need to actually download the app for it.

And I just want to forget the device. Forget device. Oh, this is a great conversation you guys are having. Um Um. Pattern recognition like a. Rejects. Do you think you'll, um, this is something that we could try to do on screen. That would be helpful for everyone. Because like, even if I don't know how to do it, I can totally see if we could get a. Um, like a guest on to see if they could help out with it
Um. Pattern recognition like a. Rejects. Do you think you'll, um, this is something that we could try to do on screen. That would be helpful for everyone.

Thank you. I'm going to read you this and make it like a dark cherry wood because that's what a cherry stain because that's what our other stuff is.

Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to read you this and make it like a dark cherry wood because that's what a cherry stain because that's what our other stuff is. And then I found out that the top of it is laminate. Doesn't work. So I started taking the laminate off and created a giant gouge It was going to give up and then slowly figured out how to fill it. And then it also, you know, I got all the way done about to put the doors back on and I realized it sags. Like, I don't know if you guys can tell, it's supposed to have three doors, but it like sags really bad down in the middle
It was going to give up and then slowly figured out how to fill it. And then it also, you know, I got all the way done about to put the doors back on and I realized it sags. Like, I don't know if you guys can tell, it's supposed to have three doors, but it like sags really bad down in the middle So I couldn't put the doors back on. And I was like, you know what, I'm just not going to use it. And but using it as a background works because normally I won't be trying to do that on stream. And then see if there's battery. I don't think I've charged these in forever so I don't think these are
So I couldn't put the doors back on. And I was like, you know what, I'm just not going to use it. And but using it as a background works because normally I won't be trying to do that on stream.
