From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that supports silliness, seriously. This episode is brought to you by Trade Coffee and Hover. I'm Jay and with me is the silliest unicorn I know, the one Kathy Campbell. Hi Kathy! Oh, that's me. I am very silly, as anyone who's ever spoken to me knows. And I'm super excited to be back with you! Yeah, I've been gone, but I'm back and I think I'm back for the rest of the year. Can't say the same for my co-host, but... I know, spoiler, I won't be, but that's fine. That's okay, we'll have a special guest when that happens. But let's start the show by talking about all the things that happened while I wasn't at the show. Right? Like the amazing James hanging out with me last episode. We've gotten some really wonderful feedback and support for James and everyone. And I just want to say thank you for everyone that has taken some time to reach out and support and also a reminder that you are amazing. If you're listening to this, hi, hi, I'm going to talk. Ignore Jay real quick. You're amazing. Your pain is valid. Your issues are valid. Any concerns that you have are completely valid. And hey, how about you go take care of yourself? I mean, yeah, you can listen to me. I agree with all these things. No, that meant that like I'm ignoring Jay in this conversation right here. Not that Jay was going to be saying bad things. I'm Jay and I don't approve. I mean, no, I approve this message, of course. That's surprising that came out wrong, but that's fine. What about you, Jay? You know, just hanging out, listening to you and James, you know, do an amazing show and not sitting there throwing my own burdens onto it. I didn't talk about this before, Kathy. I told you about this, but I started going to therapy again, which is really great. And now not talking to Kathy, talking to the rest of the people. Hi. I actually have a really great situation in which, for those that don't know, because you can't tell from my voice, but I am a black male veteran with ADHD and some other things, which I'll talk about in a second. And I have a therapist who is a black male veteran with ADHD and some other things, which is like the first time that that's ever happened in my life is that I have a professional that not only understands kind of the diagnoses that I have, but then also like the cultural background and historical baggage that comes with all of those things. And I just want to say it is the most refreshing and like confirming and like, or I guess affirming thing that I feel like I've had regarding my mental health in so long of a time. So absolutely incredible. I was so excited for you when I heard that. And also to clarify and confirm black space male and male spent and spelled M-A-L-E, not black male. Kathy has dirt on me and prevents me from not ever not doing the show again. I have to always show up or Kathy releases the Campbell cut. I just like the first time you said it, I was like, wait, I know what this means. And yet my ears heard something different. So I wanted to make sure to clarify. Yeah. And I will use this as one of my follow up pieces. I have done a lot of talking about mental health in the last few months. And I found out that apparently I'm on YouTube a lot talking about these things. I did a talk in Atlanta while I was out in Georgia. And then I also was on ADHD online as well as ADHD nerds podcast. And there are videos of me doing all of those things. And if you are considering getting an ADHD diagnosis and you want to know how it may or may not help you in the future or those things, then yeah, check out any of those videos. I'm sure we'll have links in the show notes there. But also this past month, October was ADHD awareness month. So I've been doing a lot in that space. And it's not to say that now it's November, I'm not going to be doing things, but it's been on my mind a lot. And I'm already excited for what I can take into next year to make that even better. But yeah, there was that whole thing, me being gone. And yeah, I gave my first keynote, a keynote for those that don't know is like, when a big conference happens, they usually invite the speaker to come in and give a big talk that's supposed to kind of set the tone for the rest of the conference. I got to do that with a friend of mine, the amazing Melanie Arbor. Shout out to her. We worked on this idea of the tech community that I belong to being very similar to, historically, to public swimming pools in the United States. And there's a lot of fun and excitement that comes with that. There's also a lot of historical baggage that comes with that. And a lot of lessons learned. And ultimately, I guess we made the pitch that swimming pools are great, but they're even better when you have lifeguards on duty. So let's all volunteer to be a lifeguard from time to time. And it was a wonderful experience, one that I can't wait for the next time to happen. And yeah, that was all the stuff that happened while I was gone, apparently. Oh, yeah. Absolutely amazing. There was this other thing that happened, Kathy. But before we talk about it, I want to let people know that, hey, you can support all the fun stuff that we're doing by becoming a member at relay.fm.com. And you can support the show by checking out uconnwearit.com and purchasing stickers to decorate your space and remind you that you are a conductor. You have big conductor energy. The tire method. And of course, you can do it. Merge alert. And as a surprise, if you go to uconnwearit.com, you can also find some things that you can wear. And we have a couple of shirts that we're going to be releasing by the time this show airs. They will be available. We have the Conduit logo shirt, which is amazing because our Conduit logo is, it pops out and I've seen, I've had people like see my phone and be like, whoa, what's that logo? That's really cool. Is that your brand? And I'm like, well, it's a show and you should listen to it. Uconn, listen to it. But we also have some really good I am a conductor shirts that if you've seen the sticker that we have, the I'm a conductor sticker, it is definitely so cool to have that on a shirt. It is a wonderful, I plan on getting a couple for myself. We have plenty of colors to choose from and of course, a plethora of sizes. Yeah. And women's cuts and children as well as hoodies in the Conduit logo aspect and tank tops as well. Ooh, I like it. So yeah, again, go to uconnware.com. There'll be a link in the show notes there for that as well. Kathy, we've been talking a lot. How do we do this last week? Let's find out in our connection check. Well, excuse me. You didn't zap. Oh, zap. Sorry. It's been so long since I've zapped. I didn't know what to do. Zap. Day since last zapping. Oh, goodness. Well, the last Conduit span, I have a red X because I did not even start my business budget. I know it's been a heck of a Fortnite. So I feel like I keep saying that and I'm trying my best to reframe some things in my brain. We'll see how it goes. That's all I'm going to say. Well, I mean, I want to check in on you there. You mentioned reframing. I mean, definitely the red X there on not starting it. But I mean, if you've had such a wild ride of the last Conduit, is that OK? Is it fine it didn't get started? Yes and no. It really is something that needs to happen. And it's not even that I have been overly busy. I've got some big projects that are going and some exciting things that are happening in my business, but it's been a weird brain Fortnite. And so working on being kind to myself and to my brain. So that's what I mean by that reframing, trying to not be like, oh my gosh, I'm such a jerk. I'm such a, like, you know, being nice to myself and also trying to remind myself of all the things that I have done, which is good. Like, just because I didn't do this one thing doesn't mean I'm a failure by any means. And so just try to I may need to adjust my meds. I love the insight that comes from just processing all of that. But I mean, yeah, that's so tough. I'm sorry that all these things have been happening and that, you know, I'm at least happy that you are aware of all of these things as they're happening and that you're like, well, how do we how do we get out of that? That is something that I've been struggling with myself and trying to figure out is, you know, how do how do I and I mean, this is this even connects with with my connection as well. So I will just go ahead and say mine like mine was to DFG and DFN two projects. I've made those up. DFG is done for good and DFN is done for now. I wanted to done for good two projects and done for now one. I I basically caught myself in a situation where it's like, I feel like I'm doing so many things that I needed to put a button on some stuff. And, you know, to be honest, I feel like I'm middle of the road at this. Like I the thing that I done for good was the thing that was due that week. So like, of course, it was done for good because it's done. I did it and it's done, which is great because that's a lot of weight off of my shoulders. But then there was also like some stuff that I said I was going to put a button on that I can I like I did one and didn't do the other. So, you know, I'm still struggling and I recognize that I'm still struggling to give up some of the projects that I have to make room, not even room for more projects, but like room for like the current projects that I have. Yeah. But yeah, like, and I want us to revisit kind of the DFG, DFM stuff later, but that's for another episode. I think, you know, right now I feel like we're both in a space where, you know, we'll talk about it later, where we need to we need to make room. But I think we need to make room for some, you know, mental affirming things, some fun things, but also get us through the rest of the process that we're in and the funk that we're in, I guess. What about our conductors? Yeah, our conductors have been busy. We're going to start off with Kate, who created the, I think we're calling it like a semi conduct conduit, half conduit, demi conduit, something like that. Kate basically came in and they gave us ultimately two connections, but also like, I'm just going to go for it. So the first week they put half conduit connection check, green checkmark, finished my CV and launched the changes to my website, also made significant progress on sorting and my room feels much less of a mess. And then gave my connection for the next half conduit is to get the spreadsheet sorted out for my job search and start the research. So the connection check for that one is the second half conduit, also green circle, got the spreadsheet sorted with many, many columns and conditional highlighting and have just started the research. So great job, Kate, getting things done in weekly half conduit sections. Our soprano of the show, Debo says, green checkmark got the old dressers out of the house by paying someone to deal with it so that we wouldn't injure ourselves. Also made good progress on figuring out my new responsibilities at work. Awesome. Congratulations. And I'm glad that when we have the privilege to pay someone to solve the problem, sometimes it's good to remember that you're not just solving the problem, but you're also preventing all of the angst and anxiety of letting that thing just sit there and linger. So good job of just making the decision to let it be someone else's problem and taking care of it. Yeah, exactly. All right. Our favorite blue dragon has a green tree and a blue heart. As of this morning, I am packed, prepared, and despite what is norm on my travel days, I have actually eaten breakfast. To Orlando I go for my first academic conference. I'm so excited to hear how it goes. Good luck, Skye. Our sloth of the show, Ankenu says, green checkmark. While I didn't do as thorough of a job as I intentionally intended, I made big strides in cleaning or clearing surfaces and tidying up my office and hobby space and getting most things where they needed to be and decluttering a bunch of stuff I didn't need to hold on to. I'm inclined to lean a little yellow, but no, this is just green. Hey, it sounds like you did the thing, but also maybe it can be a continuing thing that you do and you can keep getting all those greens little by little. Yeah, exactly. All right, James, connection check. Our panda of the show shipped all of the things. All my app updates are out and I did more than I thought I could, but still didn't overdo things, at least not too much. You know what? We'll take it. And especially recognizing when you are doing too much and working towards getting better at not doing all of the things. And then our Oracle of the show, Soph says, green apple achievement unlocked new house. We have successfully moved now to finish unpacking. Congratulations Soph. And also, yeah, finish unpacking. The longer you wait, ask people whose connection checks have been to unpack after a year, the harder it is. Oops. Maybe I just need to throw everything away. Our pathologist of the show, Laura says, connection check, green book. Doing OK with planning my less structured days. A physical monthly planner and highlights are currently featuring prominently in planning what needs to be worked on each day. I also figured out that I like using Zotero for article management, but ended up hooking up my personal laptop to an external monitor at work so I can still use Obsidian for my notes. Whatever anyone might say, using whatever works is what works. And it sounds like you're figuring out how to make what needs to work work. So congratulations. Yeah, Kathy knows I've had some struggles in that planning and management space lately, but we'll save that for a systems check later. Our nameless of the show, anyway, our nameless of the show, name redacted, says, green check mark. We are as packed as we can be to move into our house, though delays in materials have pushed back the move in date by three weeks. Ouch, that's hard. And I know that that's been an ongoing challenge, just given all of supply constraints and things and the whole housing market right now is a little wild, at least in the US. And I'm sure that probably reflects in other parts of the world as well. But at least you're doing everything that you can. So good job on that. Again, our final connection check for this conduit comes from our trained enthusiast of the show, Dave connection check green square still got the QA job. The duck has arrived. I got the job offer three fantastic things in a row. Congratulations. All right. So let's jump into the main topic. But before we do, I think we have a sponsor.

I mean, when I think of the business unicorn of the internet, silliness is not a thing. It's very serious, only the most serious of unicorning around. Absolutely. I definitely do not choose my products based on the silliness factor because that would be silly. I mean, okay, so obviously, yes, we are two very silly individuals in that one, we embrace the puns, we embrace the jokes, this is who we are as individuals. But also, I think that one of the things that I would dare say have brought to our success talking about productivity and things is that we are one of the few folks out there that don't take it so serious. Yeah, it's exhausting to be serious in my mindset. Obviously, I'm not going to, I don't know, invite a clown to a funeral unless that's something that really vibes with the person. I don't know, we're not talking about, no, we're not going to do a funeral. Clown funerals are. Yeah. That's an AI generated piece of art that I need in my life. Oh my gosh. No, I don't need that. But there are moments to be serious. However, most everything can have a silly factor to it. Yeah. And there's that song, Look at the Brighter Side of Life, which I think comes from Life of Brian, which that whole scene itself is very silly. That whole comedy group is- Country Python is, yeah. That whole group is very silly. And I've even noticed, speaking of Python, the programming community that I'm a part of, the language is named after Monty Python. It's named after the troop. It's not named after the animal. I never knew that. Yeah. And they actually work to infuse a bit of silliness, or at least not so seriousness, in case they're joking about things. It's a part of what made the language so approachable in the beginning. And all that to say, I kind of forgot about that. And a lot of my journey personally has been focused on how do I become more serious about things until recently when I just kind of said, you know what? Forget that. I'm going to embrace the silliness in me. Yeah. In 2021, I had a phrase that I would- I used it so many times. And I would say, have more fun in 2021. Because silliness helps alleviate some pressures and serious like weights in your brain. And being able to remind myself, too, that it's okay to have fun with something and that adding silly things to what could be the most basic functionality can help get things done. And this includes doing work and projects that might be more serious. But if you do it, I don't know, using a fun rainbow colored keyboard with lights to make it silly. Oh, great. I have a friend who would have a spreadsheet tiara. So anytime she was working on a spreadsheet, she put on her tiara because it made her feel more fun and it would be silly. And it was a way to kind of lighten the mode for spreadsheet time. Spreadsheet time. There's so many amazing content creators that I follow. And now I'm thinking of Evan and Kaitlin, who are this couple that do projects with resin and woodworking and things like that. And it makes them very approachable in that they're very silly in the things that they're doing. They replace their keycaps with resin. Speaking of secret keyboard club, if you know, you know. There's a person in our industry that I got to meet virtually that has the painting of Squidward, the really artsy painting of Squidward, entirely made out of keycaps. And it is like the most millennial thing ever. And it's always a topic of conversation. And it's like this whole idea of I can be serious, but also I want you to know that there's a silly side of me as well. So and that's kind of the other piece of that puzzle as well. Boldenbrash is the name of the painting. Thank you, Robert, in the chat. The thing that makes silliness so great is how it can be a conduit, for lack of a better phrase, to doing the more serious thing. Kind of like you said, putting on the silly tiara, the spreadsheet tiara allows you to get into that mode, but also remember that it's not a big deal. And I love that. So I wanted to ask you, Kathy, what is the silly thing that you do to help prepare for the super serious task that's about to happen? I think the biggest thing is the fact that my headphones have a unicorn horn. Yes. Honest. I have pink with light up, like the cup things over your ears. They have kitty ears and a unicorn horn in the middle. And it's absolutely without a doubt, my best slash favorite purchase ever, because it really helps solidify that the people that contact me to become a member of the unicorn herd are my clients. Because anytime I've had somebody, I've had an intro call and believe me, I've had these before, like this has happened, even though my website is already showcasing all of the silliness factor. I am prancing around in a unicorn onesie and the majority of the photos on my website. So it's laying it out there because I only want to talk to the people that I want to talk to that will enjoy the silliness factor. Um, but if they get to an intro call and they don't like see my headset and immediately smile or giggle or make some sort of commentary on it, I have a feeling that they're not going to work out very well with me. Um, it's only happened a couple of times, but it definitely has happened. And it's um, not a red flag necessarily because obviously I'm going to give everyone a chance, but it definitely recognizes that maybe we aren't going to be the best match in a business sense, which is totally fine. I get it. It's like, if you are in an industry or if your business is very serious and steadfast and like not boring necessarily, but also boring, we're not going to work well together and that's okay because like I it's fine. Find somebody that can have less silly and that's again, totally fine. But for me, I want full silly all the time. I love it. Can I, can I share a thing that I do that isn't, I mean, I think it's silly, but some people might be like, okay, okay, nerd. Yes, please. So I recently started journaling again and I don't look at it as journaling because if I look at it as journaling, then that's just something that hasn't really worked for me in the past. So instead I handwrite blog posts to myself and this is the, the interesting part about this is that I sign each one with my fancy pen and as if it's not even a letter. It's just like, you're setting it up to have a journal of Jay Miller's like letters to himself put into the Smithsonian. I mean, it really is like this, this moment of like, things have happened. Like I had my last post was called a weekend alone part two, even though there was no weekend alone part one. But it signifies that I had two weeks where, you know, for most of the weekend, I was alone in the house because, you know, my wife and my daughter went out and, and we're doing things. And like, I got very introspective on, you know, some of the feelings that I've, I've, you know, gone through. I've been trying to do more cognitive behavioral therapy. So defining the emotion and explaining how it made me feel and all these other things. And it's like, this is a straight up blog post. I could just type this in and like put it on my blog and then like publish it to the world, but I'm not going to. And at the end, like it is absolutely signed in, you know, a fancy pen that I got from the pen boss himself in like the best like calligraphic signature that I can make. And it's dated. And the thing is, since I've started doing that, I have journaled at least three times a week for like the last like month. And sometimes, sometimes it's like, you know, more of like just note taking. Sometimes it is just an insight from, you know, what happened in that day. Sometimes it's, it's wrapping up this, this long project that I've been working on or beginning to think about the next project that I'm going to pick up. But ultimately, all it's doing is encouraging me to, to get the stuff out of my head. And it's just been super helpful. But, but again, like I get to the end and I'm like, I think that's it. Okay, let me go grab the fancy pen. Big, big swishes. Here we go. Best, best swishes. Wow, Jay. Wow. Best swishes is hilarious and horrific at the same time. Is there, is there any other thing that you think that you do that, that injects some, some fun into your, your day to day? Oh goodness. I'm trying to think. Maybe there's something that you'd like to do to inject some fun. And these aren't connections. I'm just, I'm just saying that these are, maybe there's a thing that you would like to do to inject some fun. Yeah. I feel like I need to do more desk dance parties. I've done them in the past when I was like feeling really stressed or like weighted down. And I would just turn, blast some music and dance a la Grey's Anatomy. And I would always feel better after. And I don't know why I stopped doing that. And I probably should do that more often. I'm trying to think of something else that would be like good, but my brain is, is just not following up super well, but I definitely need to concentrate. No, not need. I want to concentrate on finding even more silly things to add to my life. That's awesome. I recently also made the commitment to create a dedicated silliness time. A coworker of mine and I have had this idea of, we're in the, the corporatey space with business this and synergy and all these other words that really mean nothing. Let's circle back and discuss the synergy. Exactly. Exactly. So one of the things that we did was, we want to have a way to express, like we can, we don't have to be drones when it comes to proof of concepts, demos, and like explaining things. So we decided that we're going to get on our normal call that we have, so not adding more work to it, just getting on our regularly scheduled call, live stream them and give ourselves permission to be as silly as possible. And at the end of the day, we're going to also throw in the caveat, but it's for our work with a winky face on it. And we, the funny thing is we've already like done this as a, as a proof of concept of like, we were, we did this, this recap of this event that happened. And then at the very end, you could tell that it was running long because we were starting to get sillier and sillier. And we were talking about this, this idea of these little badges that go on a website and someone showed us this resource that we can make our own. And we were like, what if we just made one that does nothing but tell you like how close you are to Wednesday? Like that's it. It just anywhere in the world. How close is it to Wednesday? Like two days away, one day away. And it's like, yeah, let's just do it. And the thought is like, oh, it's going to take too long. It's a waste of time. And it's like, no, it took us 30 minutes and then it was done. And then we had this proof of concept that when you go to it now, it's like days until Wednesday, one. And the cool part about that is I over the weekend, I was thinking about this. I go, you know, we actually do other things. Like I have this show that records, you know, once a week, every Friday, and we actually have to have a deadline for when submissions for that show is. So why don't I actually use this to say, hey, the deadline is in this much time. So then I took that thing that we made out of pure silliness and actually applied it into a thing that is very practical. And that to me is like the whole reason why I wanted to talk about this stuff was like being silly sometimes isn't just like it makes me feel better inside, but it removes some of the blockers into solving problems that you might have because at the time you're not really trying to solve the problem. You're just trying to inject a little bit of fun into your day. Yeah, I think the idea of how your brain can kind of think differently if you're just like, oh, this is for fun. It kind of removes a little bit of that stress, which also means that you are able to kind of. flow in a different way. So you're able to do things that, oh, if you were in, you know, a big meeting with people, you wouldn't ever make a suggestion of a countdown to Wednesday, but because you're like, oh, this would be funny, ha ha ha, like, JAPES are great and. Having more of them in your life means that you will be able to have more fun. And I am 100% all for that. I am. I am also for great JAPES, not to be confused with the NFT product that I'm not in support of that one. I don't even know what that is. And I'm OK. You know, I'm totally fine. I don't need to know. No, those are those are board JAPES. I mean, the other thing. You straight. Me too. It probably tells us that we should start wrapping the show up, but I know because we're silly right now. But before we do that, we have one more sponsor we'd like to think.

I mean, that just explains how easy it is to sign up for a domain right when you're thinking about it, as well as to make sure that it never expires by turning that renew on. I cannot even say, I cannot count how many silly domain names I've bought for funny projects or like redirects. Redirects are great because if you have something silly, I think when the weird fish tattoo that Federico Vettici got after Conduit or after Connected, he did a blog post about it. I had a silly domain name, federicosurprise.com, that I had redirected that blog post. It was ridiculous and not a waste of money at all because it made me giggle every time I thought about it. Having domain names to be silly is super fun as seen by uconnwearit.com. Perfect. In addition to the classics like .com, you can get extensions like .shop, .tech, like Jane found out and .art. With over 400 more to choose from, you'll be able to find the perfect domain name for your business, one that's memorable, relevant, and boosts your brand. You can buy a domain, set up custom email boxes, and point it to your website in just a few clicks. Plus, if you ever run into trouble, help is just a phone call or chat away. Secure, simple, and reliable, Hover is a trusted and popular choice amongst millions of people launching any kind of brand or business.

Our thanks to Hover for their support of this show and all of Relay FM. I know the ad's over, but I just want to throw out there that in the time it took to read that ad, I have forwarded jmiller.tech to my website. Incredible. Absolutely incredible. So, Kathy, what are you going to try to do for your connection? Yeah, it's been, like I mentioned at the start of the podcast, it's been a heavy period of time in the soup household. So I am going to concentrate on adding more silly to my daily routine. Try a little silliness. I think I was just writing one. I love it. Yes. Do you have anything in particular that you're going to do with it? I don't know, but I'm wondering if I might. I have those LED lights that you put on the top of your room like all of the TikTokers do. Oh, fancy. I have them and I never put them up because I thought I would paint my walls, but I actually really like the white walls, so I may just put them up and then I can maybe create some sort of fanciness and make them dance when I have my dance party so I can have like a shortcut or something that reminds me to have a dance party. So something like that might work. That's awesome. I still don't know what I'm going to do. OK, Jay talks out his connection on the fly. Part infinity. Part 35. Exactly. The episode 35, 35th time Jay's tried to do this. So I definitely do want to continue to do more silliness in my things. That being said, I do feel like there are a couple of things that I could have easily wrapped up that I didn't that would have made that yellow a green. And the thing is they're all relatively simple things. I could set a pomodoro or two and just say I'm going to work on them for the next however many minutes and then wrap it up. So I'm going to do that. I'm going to wrap up the things that prevented my DFG, DFN status. And I will figure out a better way to word that before next show. I mean, honestly, you can word it however you want because the connection is for you. Oh, that's true. Wrap up the things that prevented DFN, DFG. OK, and I'm going to be hovering over those phrases for the next few conduits. Obviously, we mentioned before we're going to have a guest during one of those. But hopefully when we get back, maybe we'll get to them a little bit more and talk about some of the process that took place. But I also look at our calendar and it says that we have a systems check coming up. Oh, my goodness. We're already almost at the end of another season. What is time? What is time? Yeah, Jay's going to wrap up his stuff. Kathy's going to add more silly things. What about the conductors? Yeah, our owl of the show, Kate, their connection for the next half conduit is to get the spreadsheet sorted out for their job search and start the research while still continuing the sorting, of course, our soprano, the show. Debo says it's all about self care for the next few weeks. I love it. I'm having surgery before the next conduit. Oh, no, I need to focus on rest, recovery and letting my husband take care of me. Absolutely. One thousand percent. Yes. OK, sorry. I didn't mess up the spreadsheet, but I kind of did. But it's fine because the next the real next connection for Kate was to continue the job research and sorting ongoing projects. Kate, the the Demi Conductor's conduction, the Demi Conductor, the Demi Connections clearly ruined my brain. So I ruined this. Not you. You did great. I'm going to move on and we're going to do Sky, our blue dragon of the show's next connection, which is while at this conference, they want to walk the fine line between being as much of an extrovert as possible and making connections without exhausting themselves too much. I don't know what type of conference it is, so perhaps I can reach out to them and get more information. They are currently right this second flying to Orlando. Well, awesome. Wow. Dragons flying. Imagine that. But I would I would hope that they remember that of all of the tracks that are at conferences, the mental health track is definitely one of them and take some time for themselves as well. Anyway, the panda of the show says to also take a well-earned break. This is this is self-care week. I love it. Take a well earned break. I have nothing I have to do for work right now. It's time to relax a bit and recharge the batteries. I'm glad that you're using rechargeable batteries because if a panda opened its belly up and put new batteries in, I would be very concerned. But also, I don't want to know where that plugs in. So good job, Panda. I hope that you have a good recharging. Wow. You made it silly, Jay. Our oracle of the show, Soph, their new connection is I have November set aside for some writing projects. I'd like to finish the guest blog I've been working on, draft a book chapter and make progress on the journal article I'm writing. It's totally doable if I don't get distracted with other things. I mean, distractions are part of life and I wish you all the best. Our pathologist of the show, Laura, says finishing planning and navigate a visit from my mom, a weekend trip up to see my brother and my son's birthday party. That sounds like a lot of celebrations happening. Aka prioritize planning some personal things, which probably means working on these things in the evening. Some when I'm usually pretty brain dead. Yeah, again, make sure to sprinkle in a little bit of silliness and a little bit of recharging, however you choose to do so in that area, for yourself in between them. If you know that the evenings aren't going to be a great time for you, then force inject them other places. No, it is pause slash dance slash recharge break and make them happen when they need to happen, not just when you don't have the energy left to even do it. Yeah, and Laura talked about that connection in the live stream chat, which you can hang out in the Discord with us. We record this live every other Tuesday at 12 o'clock Pacific time is when we start. We have some pre-show, post-show, all sorts of goodies. But they said that they should make that a connection for near the end of November after the craziness that will be mentioned in her connection. So clearly self-care is on the horizon for Laura. Our nameless of the show, Robert's New Connection, plan the major things that I need to get done in the next two months. The holidays and other events take more time than I mentally allot for. And I have three major projects that need to be completed by the beginning of January. Take a day to think about my new theme while I continue with the year of suits or is the time for a new theme? I mean, you can always change your theme whenever you want. That is a valid tool. And it sounds like you got a lot going on. So yeah, maybe taking some time to see about your theme could be really helpful to kind of adjust where you're at now. And finally, our train enthusiast of the show. We still have the Halloween names. Dave says, try and look at how to better focus while at home. Maybe it's the duck of focus. Maybe it's something else. I love the duck of focus. Yeah. Today I have a Homer coffee cup that has smiling Homer and dough Homer. And depending on whether or not I've done a good thing, I turn it to look at which homers look at me. My coffee mug says cheers witches. I like it. It makes me happy. If you'd like to submit a connection, you can do so on Twitter by tweeting at conduit FM using the hashtag my conduit.

Kathy, I need to go put on my red nose and my fluffy hair and get my water squirt toy. So can you tell me really quick, did we do it? Based on the fact that I am wearing my fancy glasses with the mustache attached to the nose, we con did it.
