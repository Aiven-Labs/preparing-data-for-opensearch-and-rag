Hello, hello, beautiful humans. Welcome to another episode of Teach Gen Tech. And today's first episode of using OBS. So with that in mind, please let me know if something's not working. If you can't hear me, if the screen's not working well because I need to learn how to use it too And today, it's just me. I don't have a guess today. I am also nervous. That's never going to change. That is something that is great about life learning and doing things life is well. It's just what's going to happen. Everybody is just going to see me awkwardly go through things
And today, it's just me. I don't have a guess today. I am also nervous. That's never going to change. That is something that is great about life learning and doing things life is well. It's just what's going to happen. Everybody is just going to see me awkwardly go through things But today is going to be about learning Postgres. Postgres sequel. I've heard. I like it, bro. And if you fucking if we're doing it live, yeah. That's basically my philosophy in life. I've done a lot of talking about it. Hello, hello. Yeah, we are setting up a Postgres sequel database today
But today is going to be about learning Postgres. Postgres sequel. I've heard. I like it, bro. And if you fucking if we're doing it live, yeah. That's basically my philosophy in life. I've done a lot of talking about it. Hello, hello. Yeah, we are setting up a Postgres sequel database today I've never done it. I have a to do list of things to check out and try to do. So let me grab that. I totally have it on a Google Doc just though. Remember what I'm doing. Yay. Okay. So. Yay
I've never done it. I have a to do list of things to check out and try to do. So let me grab that. I totally have it on a Google Doc just though. Remember what I'm doing. Yay. Okay. So. Yay Yay. Okay. So. Yay. Hey, Chrissy, what's up? I'm so excited that I actually have the chat up here because I feel like I would forget to say hi to people. And now the other people can say hi to each other. So one of the coolest not cool list. I'm not really sure
Yay. Okay. So. Yay. Hey, Chrissy, what's up? I'm so excited that I actually have the chat up here because I feel like I would forget to say hi to people. And now the other people can say hi to each other. So one of the coolest not cool list. I'm not really sure Mattering on your perspective of doing this is getting started is we kind of have to figure out where to go get Postgres. Oh, it's crazy cool. Okay. That's cute. Yay. So we're going to the website. Sweet. Those are options
Mattering on your perspective of doing this is getting started is we kind of have to figure out where to go get Postgres. Oh, it's crazy cool. Okay. That's cute. Yay. So we're going to the website. Sweet. Those are options Those are options. I also will say that I totally chose like Postgres as the first one because if you didn't know this, I love elephants. Love elephants. I have a ton of elephants
Those are options. I also will say that I totally chose like Postgres as the first one because if you didn't know this, I love elephants. Love elephants. I have a ton of elephants One day I want to take time off to go to Africa and spend time helping elephants, which I don't know if anybody knew, but if you ever go to a rescue like that or somewhere that does the rehabilitation, at least from what I've seen is it's like a ton of work
One day I want to take time off to go to Africa and spend time helping elephants, which I don't know if anybody knew, but if you ever go to a rescue like that or somewhere that does the rehabilitation, at least from what I've seen is it's like a ton of work Like you're working 14 hours a day, 60s a week. And one day I'm going to be able to afford that. I'm very, very excited. Okay. Well, we got a couple different ways. So we can local, of course, Ivens where I work. So we do have options on doing it through Ivan too
Like you're working 14 hours a day, 60s a week. And one day I'm going to be able to afford that. I'm very, very excited. Okay. Well, we got a couple different ways. So we can local, of course, Ivens where I work. So we do have options on doing it through Ivan too Just got to see where it goes from here. I'm going to make this small with us. People can see what I'm doing. We know this. I think that makes it second-hand mouse. Elephants like peanuts. I mean, I don't know if they actually do. Do they? Damn it. We're on Mac
Just got to see where it goes from here. I'm going to make this small with us. People can see what I'm doing. We know this. I think that makes it second-hand mouse. Elephants like peanuts. I mean, I don't know if they actually do. Do they? Damn it. We're on Mac We're on Mac. Wait, so this is me just like think, okay, cool. So it does have a candy insult through a homebrew. I was just thinking that I was like, wait, can't you do it through CLI? Oh, there's also the Postgres app. Add. That's kind of fun
We're on Mac. Wait, so this is me just like think, okay, cool. So it does have a candy insult through a homebrew. I was just thinking that I was like, wait, can't you do it through CLI? Oh, there's also the Postgres app. Add. That's kind of fun That's kind of fun. What do you think, y'all? How should we install it today? Any thoughts on what we should do? Just I'm kind of thinking that this Postgres app looks kind of fun. But I am open to suggestions. And I won't play music for all of you. Sorry
That's kind of fun. What do you think, y'all? How should we install it today? Any thoughts on what we should do? Just I'm kind of thinking that this Postgres app looks kind of fun. But I am open to suggestions. And I won't play music for all of you. Sorry Sorry. I don't know if it's going to be royalty free. But it's really weird to sit in here and silence listening to myself. So we're going to have some music for myself. You're going to be cute little elephant. Is it a feature of installation package? Okay. Okay. I know I totally said it that way
Sorry. I don't know if it's going to be royalty free. But it's really weird to sit in here and silence listening to myself. So we're going to have some music for myself. You're going to be cute little elephant. Is it a feature of installation package? Okay. Okay. I know I totally said it that way But now I'm back and out. I'm back and out. I'm going to you. I'm real. Is that being I already have it installed if... Or do I have a random documentation? Oh, this looks me check it. Okay. Let's monitor it then. I'm asking this because I've done a lot of things like with installing on homebrew
But now I'm back and out. I'm back and out. I'm going to you. I'm real. Is that being I already have it installed if... Or do I have a random documentation? Oh, this looks me check it. Okay. Let's monitor it then. I'm asking this because I've done a lot of things like with installing on homebrew And I'm not to the point yet where I know exactly what's installed. I know that it's installed a lot of things that it many use often. So I need to figure out if it's actually been installed. Okay. So we can check that on windows. That's not helpful. That checks the status. Hmm
And I'm not to the point yet where I know exactly what's installed. I know that it's installed a lot of things that it many use often. So I need to figure out if it's actually been installed. Okay. So we can check that on windows. That's not helpful. That checks the status. Hmm Hmm. I'll just assume it's basically homebrew. And that's cool. Okay. So we're not going to try homebrew. Homebrew installs. Look at what I still don't know is a bro nifty or a bro nify? Bro nifty
Hmm. I'll just assume it's basically homebrew. And that's cool. Okay. So we're not going to try homebrew. Homebrew installs. Look at what I still don't know is a bro nifty or a bro nify? Bro nifty Like how do you say it which way? Homebrew installs it on its own directory then some all like link directs it to your path. DG is going to be easier to use from Docker. Brother nifty. Okay. Brother nifty. Bro nifty
Like how do you say it which way? Homebrew installs it on its own directory then some all like link directs it to your path. DG is going to be easier to use from Docker. Brother nifty. Okay. Brother nifty. Bro nifty Bro nifty. Then I'm just going to go back to the first one on the installer because well it is the first one that it gives. And I just like looked into all the other complicated ones. Yay. Yay. Okay. Yes. Open please. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it
Bro nifty. Then I'm just going to go back to the first one on the installer because well it is the first one that it gives. And I just like looked into all the other complicated ones. Yay. Yay. Okay. Yes. Open please. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. And we're going to go with the default port because that's what it gave me. And for all of those joining I am working on setting up this dress. And I've never done it just by itself and nor completely understand it
Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. Open it. And we're going to go with the default port because that's what it gave me. And for all of those joining I am working on setting up this dress. And I've never done it just by itself and nor completely understand it So we're just kind of going stuff through stuff and seeing what I can figure out. Okay. Yay. I am curious for everyone joining and bro nifty
So we're just kind of going stuff through stuff and seeing what I can figure out. Okay. Yay. I am curious for everyone joining and bro nifty Do you prefer when streamers have background music or when they're it's just like just them talking? I've been very curious about this because I've heard both especially when people want to go back and actually watch the stream. Woo. Yay. Yeah. Music is vibe
Do you prefer when streamers have background music or when they're it's just like just them talking? I've been very curious about this because I've heard both especially when people want to go back and actually watch the stream. Woo. Yay. Yeah. Music is vibe Music is vibe. I feel like I'm going to have to forget that out for next week. The nice thing about stream yard is it just did it by itself. And I'm taking notes over here off screen. I ordered a tablet that I am hoping we can see when I get it that next week that you'll be able to see my notes
Music is vibe. I feel like I'm going to have to forget that out for next week. The nice thing about stream yard is it just did it by itself. And I'm taking notes over here off screen. I ordered a tablet that I am hoping we can see when I get it that next week that you'll be able to see my notes Having it as an additional screen on screen as well. So you can see what I'm writing down what notes my way of thinking because I know for myself. That's a big way that I've been able to pick up on better ways for myself to learn has been other people's experience
Having it as an additional screen on screen as well. So you can see what I'm writing down what notes my way of thinking because I know for myself. That's a big way that I've been able to pick up on better ways for myself to learn has been other people's experience We received this works but some things that I didn't know going into Postgres. There are a lot of options to install. We haven't even tried like Ivan. We're still just trying to local but there's a lot of options on which one to choose to download
We received this works but some things that I didn't know going into Postgres. There are a lot of options to install. We haven't even tried like Ivan. We're still just trying to local but there's a lot of options on which one to choose to download And then also downloading different things that may not make sense. And I know a lot of people that watch this show, yes, we definitely have a ton of beginners that come on and ask questions. There's a lot of people and a lot of my friends so thank you
And then also downloading different things that may not make sense. And I know a lot of people that watch this show, yes, we definitely have a ton of beginners that come on and ask questions. There's a lot of people and a lot of my friends so thank you That come to listen that have actually done this before and they get it. They're like, yeah, I've done that a million times. Yeah, one thing I feel like many people may forget is it doesn't always make sense to someone you're looking at it for the very first time
That come to listen that have actually done this before and they get it. They're like, yeah, I've done that a million times. Yeah, one thing I feel like many people may forget is it doesn't always make sense to someone you're looking at it for the very first time And that's something that I need to remember and I'm working on taking the notes for. So, Stack Builder is something that I wasn't expecting. Well, that's cool. We're not doing any press. No server. We're going to click this one and see if we can make this bigger. Okay
And that's something that I need to remember and I'm working on taking the notes for. So, Stack Builder is something that I wasn't expecting. Well, that's cool. We're not doing any press. No server. We're going to click this one and see if we can make this bigger. Okay Okay. I will say one of the best parts of streaming is that it's recorded. So, if I forgot to write down something, I can go back and look at it. Okay. I would think that if I do categories, it does it all. Nope. You got to select at least one. Well, okay. Data-based server. There are options
Okay. I will say one of the best parts of streaming is that it's recorded. So, if I forgot to write down something, I can go back and look at it. Okay. I would think that if I do categories, it does it all. Nope. You got to select at least one. Well, okay. Data-based server. There are options There are options. That one's installed. Okay, cool. On-screen database server with PG admin. Yeah. Okay. I guess I'm just going to do that one because I don't know what the rest of these necessarily mean. We don't need enterprise. That's cool. And we'll figure out the rest of them
There are options. That one's installed. Okay, cool. On-screen database server with PG admin. Yeah. Okay. I guess I'm just going to do that one because I don't know what the rest of these necessarily mean. We don't need enterprise. That's cool. And we'll figure out the rest of them No, I'll go back. We are actually not going to do that directory. I found this. Oh, that is a good thing to go fix. Well, BRB as I fix my Apple settings. And, Bro Nifty, I will get music going for next time. What up, Sebastian? See, this is the weird thing
No, I'll go back. We are actually not going to do that directory. I found this. Oh, that is a good thing to go fix. Well, BRB as I fix my Apple settings. And, Bro Nifty, I will get music going for next time. What up, Sebastian? See, this is the weird thing Why do you put your name like the full Sebastian everywhere when you go by Sevier? They say you want to call you Sevier. Or Sebastian all the same time. Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool. Let's start. Code. We are going to do a new folder
Why do you put your name like the full Sebastian everywhere when you go by Sevier? They say you want to call you Sevier. Or Sebastian all the same time. Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool. Let's start. Code. We are going to do a new folder You You You You You eight months, the drastic difference of understanding. Yeah, it's like the more you know, the less you feel like you know. Because now I'm like, oh, shouldn't I know this? I don't want to tell people I don't know. Okay, get it. Finish. Finish. Yay, we have downloaded it
You You You You You eight months, the drastic difference of understanding. Yeah, it's like the more you know, the less you feel like you know. Because now I'm like, oh, shouldn't I know this? I don't want to tell people I don't know. Okay, get it. Finish. Finish. Yay, we have downloaded it Okay, cool. And now I'm going to connect to something. This is going to be cool. Let's do this one. We're going to Google this one. It's going to be fun. That's normal. Nice front end. I'm going to ask you to do those types. I'm curious
Okay, cool. And now I'm going to connect to something. This is going to be cool. Let's do this one. We're going to Google this one. It's going to be fun. That's normal. Nice front end. I'm going to ask you to do those types. I'm curious I'm curious. Is there a difference between SQL and PSQL? Well, bus systems may share core features. There are some key differences. The major ones being post-grace SQL is open source and SQL server is owned by Microsoft. It is a very good callout
I'm curious. Is there a difference between SQL and PSQL? Well, bus systems may share core features. There are some key differences. The major ones being post-grace SQL is open source and SQL server is owned by Microsoft. It is a very good callout I feel like I'm going to need this at some point in the future. And in case anybody else wants to know the random Googles I've been doing, there you go. Ooh, there's a tutorial and a cheat sheet. This is exciting. Oh, I feel like this person gets me
I feel like I'm going to need this at some point in the future. And in case anybody else wants to know the random Googles I've been doing, there you go. Ooh, there's a tutorial and a cheat sheet. This is exciting. Oh, I feel like this person gets me The post-grace SQL documentation is incredibly well written and thorough. But frankly, I didn't know where to start when reading. This is their answer to the problem. I dig it. Look at the documentation. Okay. Oh, I have a PDF of it. All right. Just going to say this is a lot
The post-grace SQL documentation is incredibly well written and thorough. But frankly, I didn't know where to start when reading. This is their answer to the problem. I dig it. Look at the documentation. Okay. Oh, I have a PDF of it. All right. Just going to say this is a lot Just, uh, yeah, I don't think I would read through that. We're still in the table front end. Only bananas. Oh, but there is a history lesson in here. I dig it. Okay. Cool. Let's go back to this. And turns to cheat sheet
Just, uh, yeah, I don't think I would read through that. We're still in the table front end. Only bananas. Oh, but there is a history lesson in here. I dig it. Okay. Cool. Let's go back to this. And turns to cheat sheet And for everyone watching as a heads up, whether you're watching this during the stream or after the stream, these are all just me working on figuring it out. So make sure to double check your resources, even if I posted something in here, I'm learning with you. So go check it later on
And for everyone watching as a heads up, whether you're watching this during the stream or after the stream, these are all just me working on figuring it out. So make sure to double check your resources, even if I posted something in here, I'm learning with you. So go check it later on If it doesn't work or does work. But to make sure you have accessibility to any websites they do try to use, I'll link them. Okay. Well. Oh, there's a lot in here. Okay. I remember until, maybe you know, my class teacher, I am cheering up a lot for Telur students. Feel like I'm gonna start here
If it doesn't work or does work. But to make sure you have accessibility to any websites they do try to use, I'll link them. Okay. Well. Oh, there's a lot in here. Okay. I remember until, maybe you know, my class teacher, I am cheering up a lot for Telur students. Feel like I'm gonna start here So let's go find an hyper. I guess we will do some updates. Yay. I do use hyper and omizish at their great. Again, those are preferences. I personally just really like them cause it makes it colorful and easier for me to read well in doing things. Oh, what do they? Hey. I like when I can
So let's go find an hyper. I guess we will do some updates. Yay. I do use hyper and omizish at their great. Again, those are preferences. I personally just really like them cause it makes it colorful and easier for me to read well in doing things. Oh, what do they? Hey. I like when I can I like when I can. Oh yeah, that would help. No tab. I didn't hit the tab. Hey, okay. So. Hey. So what I did and I'm checking out is we're looking at a. Like how to connect to Postgres. Like that is that is my next thing. So in my mind, I'm like, okay, cool
I like when I can. Oh yeah, that would help. No tab. I didn't hit the tab. Hey, okay. So. Hey. So what I did and I'm checking out is we're looking at a. Like how to connect to Postgres. Like that is that is my next thing. So in my mind, I'm like, okay, cool I found this document that says that it's a thing. Here's how to go look at it and that there was a help. And granted, I am not someone that's great at reading through every single line. I am definitely a scroller. See if I can figure it out. Watch videos
I found this document that says that it's a thing. Here's how to go look at it and that there was a help. And granted, I am not someone that's great at reading through every single line. I am definitely a scroller. See if I can figure it out. Watch videos Watch videos. Those type of things to work on figuring it out. And that is why I was going to go to the help first. Yeah, that didn't work. So I think I am definitely missing a step. Probably. Opening the connection. Using the post. Is that this one that I the dollars
Watch videos. Those type of things to work on figuring it out. And that is why I was going to go to the help first. Yeah, that didn't work. So I think I am definitely missing a step. Probably. Opening the connection. Using the post. Is that this one that I the dollars Well, the P SQL dash you postgres. Okay, cool. Yeah, thanks, Abby. And that dream. Okay. Well. Let's go back to see if I really not see. Oh, so there's a different client. I didn't draw some things. But we will. I will install that. Google that. Install that. I will Google it too
Well, the P SQL dash you postgres. Okay, cool. Yeah, thanks, Abby. And that dream. Okay. Well. Let's go back to see if I really not see. Oh, so there's a different client. I didn't draw some things. But we will. I will install that. Google that. Install that. I will Google it too Isn't that confusing though? Like I went to the postgres site and. I literally copied it, but hey. She run now. I want to install. Oh, I installed the server not the client. So if I'm taking a look at this in my like to do list. So to set up part of the setup on local is. Install. The server
Isn't that confusing though? Like I went to the postgres site and. I literally copied it, but hey. She run now. I want to install. Oh, I installed the server not the client. So if I'm taking a look at this in my like to do list. So to set up part of the setup on local is. Install. The server The server. And then. Install the client. These are all things that. Are. Someone annoying to learn. Okay. Okay. Well, there we go. We got our brain. Not going to lie. I cheated and put my hyper to just do. Go to my default folder. So. A lot of times. Make sure nothing else needs to be. Done
The server. And then. Install the client. These are all things that. Are. Someone annoying to learn. Okay. Okay. Well, there we go. We got our brain. Not going to lie. I cheated and put my hyper to just do. Go to my default folder. So. A lot of times. Make sure nothing else needs to be. Done Done. Oh, of course you do. Of course you do. There's so much. Real update. So. This is like a side quest to make sure you can install things with. Home brew. I will work on. Swinging those a little later. There is a lot to know to get even just at this point
Done. Oh, of course you do. Of course you do. There's so much. Real update. So. This is like a side quest to make sure you can install things with. Home brew. I will work on. Swinging those a little later. There is a lot to know to get even just at this point Especially if somebody doesn't have experience with. Terminal. So please comment if this is something that you want to know more about. Because I can definitely go into more of any of this. Yeah, all the installing. Okay. Okay. And we made need compilers. Interesting. So. See you soon. And then
Especially if somebody doesn't have experience with. Terminal. So please comment if this is something that you want to know more about. Because I can definitely go into more of any of this. Yeah, all the installing. Okay. Okay. And we made need compilers. Interesting. So. See you soon. And then And then. Finally, uh, semi link, uh, P SQL and other. Live PQ tools into user local. Uh, Ben, I did do something similar like of this of how I set up my terminal to be able to go to my home folder. So I will be. This part makes most sense to me doing it through. The actual finder
And then. Finally, uh, semi link, uh, P SQL and other. Live PQ tools into user local. Uh, Ben, I did do something similar like of this of how I set up my terminal to be able to go to my home folder. So I will be. This part makes most sense to me doing it through. The actual finder The actual finder. I'm going to do that off screen really quick. Easy. Easy. Easy. Just kidding. I just realized I could have done that. And for some reason, I was still thinking that I had to. So my link P SQL. If you need to have the, well, we're going to put that pen in this one
The actual finder. I'm going to do that off screen really quick. Easy. Easy. Easy. Just kidding. I just realized I could have done that. And for some reason, I was still thinking that I had to. So my link P SQL. If you need to have the, well, we're going to put that pen in this one See what happens. If something breaks, we'll find out. Okay. And just so that way everybody knows what I used. As Subby said, Google it. This is the only guy used for. Okay. Yeah. So we're going to go back to. And. Oh, yay. It works. Sweet. Look at that. We got postcards up. This is exciting. Okay
See what happens. If something breaks, we'll find out. Okay. And just so that way everybody knows what I used. As Subby said, Google it. This is the only guy used for. Okay. Yeah. So we're going to go back to. And. Oh, yay. It works. Sweet. Look at that. We got postcards up. This is exciting. Okay Okay. Hey, yeah. Thanks, Subby. Okay. So we are connected. Locally. Let us progress. So we installed it. Connected it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Interesting. And there's also like create databases and such. I'm going to you first. Okay. Actually, make this big bigger. And
Okay. Hey, yeah. Thanks, Subby. Okay. So we are connected. Locally. Let us progress. So we installed it. Connected it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Interesting. And there's also like create databases and such. I'm going to you first. Okay. Actually, make this big bigger. And And. I don't think that's necessarily what I want. But we'll find out. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right now I am for my own documentation because I feel like this is going to be complicated if I try to. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
And. I don't think that's necessarily what I want. But we'll find out. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right now I am for my own documentation because I feel like this is going to be complicated if I try to. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm staring a bit because I think I totally mixed up my links. Yes, I totally did. Be something that was on one of these pages was. There we go. Okay. That was the key to scrolling down. Adding tables and records and creating a table
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm staring a bit because I think I totally mixed up my links. Yes, I totally did. Be something that was on one of these pages was. There we go. Okay. That was the key to scrolling down. Adding tables and records and creating a table Like right above there, it was before you had tables, Alright, so I connected with pcql. So before I could secure a database, I would... Can I secure it before looking at a database? Okay. Let's see. Uh, secure your connection. We fix this link really quick. So I totally mixed up the two. And..
Like right above there, it was before you had tables, Alright, so I connected with pcql. So before I could secure a database, I would... Can I secure it before looking at a database? Okay. Let's see. Uh, secure your connection. We fix this link really quick. So I totally mixed up the two. And.. And... And to answer my own question, I will... Hmm. Hmm. Because even in here, and again, this is like the fun part of doing more research is... Um, it can be essential to restrict which database users can connect. So, again, this is far as I'm aware. I haven't actually created a database
And... And to answer my own question, I will... Hmm. Hmm. Because even in here, and again, this is like the fun part of doing more research is... Um, it can be essential to restrict which database users can connect. So, again, this is far as I'm aware. I haven't actually created a database But I do... So I'm gonna close that one, because we didn't use that one. We did use that one. I'm gonna go over here and be like, yo, do we actually... Do anything. Did we create a database yet? List databases with size, table, spaces, and description. Sweet, let's do this
But I do... So I'm gonna close that one, because we didn't use that one. We did use that one. I'm gonna go over here and be like, yo, do we actually... Do anything. Did we create a database yet? List databases with size, table, spaces, and description. Sweet, let's do this You should be able to tell me, oh, hey, there's stuff. There's stuff. Yay! Not... eligible stuff, but... Little hard to read. Oh, there we go. Okay, so we have some databases. I think that's something I need to say. Mm-hmm. It does... ...eater basis with... ...the... ...dxt. ...dxt. ...dxt. And..

I am... ...taking a screenshot to be able to put this in here as well. So it reminds me, but then also doing the text. That wouldn't actually go... ...mops. Okay, well... ...there we go.

Okay, well... ...there we go. And I feel like we need to give this Tomcat human shout out because... .... ...try to see if maybe they... ...winked their information anywhere. They need to set the top. They are dope humans. They help us. So thank you. Thank you, Tomcat. Guess who that's your name. Alright, so we do have some databases. So how do we... ...do this thing? Mm-hmm. That's client access

Alright, so we do have some databases. So how do we... ...do this thing? Mm-hmm. That's client access Is... ...client access... ...and... ...database access... ...to save. I don't think so. But... ...it's a good question to ask. Well, we can restrict IP addresses to... ...the... ...account... ...and... ...district... ...IP addresses to specific databases. Alright. This is very small. Ooh

Well, we can restrict IP addresses to... ...the... ...account... ...and... ...district... ...IP addresses to specific databases. Alright. This is very small. Ooh Ooh. Hey! This is... ...not making that much sense. Go into the next one. What up, Anthony! Look, I'm using OBS! Yay! It's kinda scary. And... ...somorrow I have to figure out... ...how to do it with... ...a guest. I'm gonna... ...get a guest. I'm gonna... ...get a guest. And... ...I'm working on.
Ooh. Hey! This is... ...not making that much sense. Go into the next one. What up, Anthony! Look, I'm using OBS! Yay! It's kinda scary.

And... ...I'm working on. ...I'm working on... ...setting up postgres. Because I've... ...only done it... ...with... ...a... ...let's see. I did it with Prisma... ...a... ...when... ...Nicoless was on the show. I think. Hello, hello, beautiful humans. Welcome to Teach... ...well... ...good for you. It is on my to-do list
...I'm working on... ...setting up postgres. Because I've... ...only done it... ...with... ...a... ...let's see. I did it with Prisma... ...a... ...when... ...Nicoless was on the show. I think. Hello, hello, beautiful humans. Welcome to Teach... ...well... ...good for you. It is on my to-do list Like, I'm trying local... ...and then... ...I was also told I could do it on a darker container. I could also do it with Ivan. We are trying them all! You spend one up a free day of this on Railway. If you need one. What is Railway? I'm gonna put that over here
Like, I'm trying local... ...and then... ...I was also told I could do it on a darker container. I could also do it with Ivan. We are trying them all! You spend one up a free day of this on Railway. If you need one. What is Railway? I'm gonna put that over here What is Railway? Oh, yeah, this shit's confusing. I've been streaming for an hour. And I'm like, dude, I haven't even... ...I don't even know... ...I'm trying to secure my connection. It's... ...not secure, I guess. I mean, that... ...that works. Bye. Now, I did it in installpostgres.app... ..
What is Railway? Oh, yeah, this shit's confusing. I've been streaming for an hour. And I'm like, dude, I haven't even... ...I don't even know... ...I'm trying to secure my connection. It's... ...not secure, I guess. I mean, that... ...that works. Bye. Now, I did it in installpostgres.app... ..app... ...because... ...you're okay. Uhhh... ...look. I was going through all this and... ...um... ...yes, probably. Probably... ...yeah, I don't... ...disagree. We have ended up with... ...home brew. For... ...the server. And... ...the client... ...yeah. It's definitely a lesson learned
app... ...because... ...you're okay. Uhhh... ...look. I was going through all this and... ...um... ...yes, probably. Probably... ...yeah, I don't... ...disagree. We have ended up with... ...home brew. For... ...the server. And... ...the client... ...yeah. It's definitely a lesson learned We'll try that next time. There are many different ways to do this. I'm trying to get all the ways I would just not doing it done first, apparently. So... ...yeah. Uhhh... Now I'm trying to secure the connection. Oh my, okay, we're coming back out of that
We'll try that next time. There are many different ways to do this. I'm trying to get all the ways I would just not doing it done first, apparently. So... ...yeah. Uhhh... Now I'm trying to secure the connection. Oh my, okay, we're coming back out of that But do you need to secure this connection if it's local as well? It's local. So who else is going to access it if you didn't set that up? Mmm... Mmm. I need it homebrew. Mmm. Mmm. Okay
But do you need to secure this connection if it's local as well? It's local. So who else is going to access it if you didn't set that up? Mmm... Mmm. I need it homebrew. Mmm. Mmm. Okay Mmm. Mmm. Okay. And just so everyone knows, and I don't think I made this clear earlier, is I'm doing this without watching a single video first. Like a lot of people are like, yo, let me go like, uh, do some Googles, see what I can figure out. I'm doing that live. Without looking at videos
Mmm. Mmm. Okay. And just so everyone knows, and I don't think I made this clear earlier, is I'm doing this without watching a single video first. Like a lot of people are like, yo, let me go like, uh, do some Googles, see what I can figure out. I'm doing that live. Without looking at videos It's gonna be fun. Well, I see why I won't find very many videos doing this, cause it's... ...deficult. But, uh, I mean, Anthony, that's what I said when you first had me create a React app. And I'm like, yo, that actually makes sense to me now. Oh, yes. Yes
It's gonna be fun. Well, I see why I won't find very many videos doing this, cause it's... ...deficult. But, uh, I mean, Anthony, that's what I said when you first had me create a React app. And I'm like, yo, that actually makes sense to me now. Oh, yes. Yes Oh, yes. Yes. There are like a million ways of doing it. But... Mmm. I'm kind of thinking this is, because this was a good start of tomorrow on tomorrow's stream, I have Ben coming on from... He works at Ivan with me as well
Oh, yes. Yes. There are like a million ways of doing it. But... Mmm. I'm kind of thinking this is, because this was a good start of tomorrow on tomorrow's stream, I have Ben coming on from... He works at Ivan with me as well He, um, actually knew him a bit before I worked there, which is really cool. And he's gonna be coming on to talk about databases, uh, or like data from the beginning. And I feel like that's gonna be a good place to start
He, um, actually knew him a bit before I worked there, which is really cool. And he's gonna be coming on to talk about databases, uh, or like data from the beginning. And I feel like that's gonna be a good place to start I just didn't want to waste today's stream time of when I could start diving into this. Yet, as you said, um, there are probably better ways of doing this. And... Yeah. I think I'm gonna take a pause on it. So we'll go back here
I just didn't want to waste today's stream time of when I could start diving into this. Yet, as you said, um, there are probably better ways of doing this. And... Yeah. I think I'm gonna take a pause on it. So we'll go back here Vah! Yeah, I do not have a stream deck yet, so I'm manually like going back and forth, but it's still really exciting. So, yay. Tomorrow I get to you figure out how to have a guest instead of ping. So excited. We're gonna try ping for the first time
Vah! Yeah, I do not have a stream deck yet, so I'm manually like going back and forth, but it's still really exciting. So, yay. Tomorrow I get to you figure out how to have a guest instead of ping. So excited. We're gonna try ping for the first time And yes, if anybody has questions or wants to follow up on this, I will have this video up a little probably today on YouTube to go through all of this and talk about what I went through. And, yeah. So, I think an hour is gonna do it for me on this one. Especially with not having..
And yes, if anybody has questions or wants to follow up on this, I will have this video up a little probably today on YouTube to go through all of this and talk about what I went through. And, yeah. So, I think an hour is gonna do it for me on this one. Especially with not having.... Uh, it's the fun things and annoying things I've teach in tech. I will say of... One of the things I love is being able to have guests on that go through some really, really complicated items
.. Uh, it's the fun things and annoying things I've teach in tech. I will say of... One of the things I love is being able to have guests on that go through some really, really complicated items Yet, at the same time, that is why it's so important to go try to do things yourself, as like what I'm doing right now
Yet, at the same time, that is why it's so important to go try to do things yourself, as like what I'm doing right now Yet, having someone on about Kafka and not quite understanding a lot of that, I'm really excited for tomorrow to be able to start from the bare basics because I think that's gonna help with a lot of the missing pieces that I've been having. So, yeah. I'm gonna wrap up for today
Yet, having someone on about Kafka and not quite understanding a lot of that, I'm really excited for tomorrow to be able to start from the bare basics because I think that's gonna help with a lot of the missing pieces that I've been having. So, yeah. I'm gonna wrap up for today And thank you all for joining and coming to hang out. And I will rate you over to Coding Garden because, well, they're dope. And they have a pretty sweet layout too. They do everything with green screens and that's something that Cebi has done before, which I really like

Bye, everyone. Why did I use Unrein? Just kidding. It's just gonna take a second. Because somehow I un-rated. I'm gonna go as an option.
