From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that is in the gravel, or at least my voice is. This episode is brought to you by Timing. I'm Jay, or at least I think I am, and with me is my amazing, phenomenal, much clearer voiced business unicorn of the planet, the one, the only amazing Kathy Campbell. Hi. Jay, I missed you. I missed being here. I'm just going to run straight into shout outs, one for the sake of my voice, but also because my shout out was to you and Rose for an amazing episode. And now I know how it feels to be a conductor because I didn't listen until it came out. And I was like, ooh, this is a great conversation. I know nothing about what we're going to talk about in this mad, mad world. In a world. Oh, sorry, I had to do it. I got asked to. Yeah, but I think you need to do the whole thing. You can't just tease it. We need a full bodied intro trailer vibe with this voice you've got going on. In a world where apps have taken over the productivity realm, there's one channel, the break room. There's also another channel, the systems and themes. Together, they make the productivity Voltron that is conduit. I love it. Yeah, it was so great to have Rose here, but I definitely missed my buddy Jay. I'm so happy that you're back, even if your voice is a little special. I am my first shout out is to the random person that picked up our gigantic beanbag. So we had major snow over Christmas, which meant that our trash and recycling didn't get picked up. So we had another week where they're just like, hey, you can leave your bags by the trash can. Cool. And we finally decided to get rid of the gigantic six foot beanbag that was living in our space that was the cat really, really liked in the worst way. It was time to get rid of it. We just said, you know what? Screw it. We're not going to try and clean it. Any of that really gross. It was time. They did not pick it up at the trash, which is understandable and totally valid. So we were waiting for the rain to stop so we could take it to the dump. But we didn't have to because some random person decided to pick it up and take it wherever they decided to take it to. So thanks, random person, for saving me a dump. It is best if we don't ask questions. I actually had to go to the dump as well because of Christmas and boxes and all those things. And yeah, California, they don't play that. We don't care if it's if it's raining like we're coming for it. That's got to it's got to go. Luckily, it doesn't snow here. So there is that. Yeah. So I have I have like a split shout out. I don't know if you've seen this movie yet, but in Kanto, we don't talk about. We we love talking about Bruno. All the tea is spilled over Bruno. But in Kanto is my shout out and a runner up shout out goes to another movie that I watched of the animated variety called Vivo. Those that don't know me, I'm not a movie person. I my ADHD makes me ask way too many questions at the most of inappropriate times in the movie. So, yeah, we don't watch movies that often. But in Kanto and Vivo both had my attention. I was singing. We were dancing. We had a great time. I think we've watched in Kanto every day for the last week. So it is it is insane. But I love it. And yeah, I changed some of the words for my daughter for like surface pressure. So instead of putting it on her sister, she can put it on her dad because that is the feeling that is the vibe. And I know it's not necessarily the best thing, but I mean, also, she's three. So hopefully I want her to grow up knowing that if she has too much weight or too much burden, she can put it on me. That's a really, really great like mindset for it. You know, teaching how to share the burden and not that they have to own it all themselves. I think that's really, really, really special. So well done. Final shout out goes to the amazing people at Upgrade. Mike and Jason, thank you for giving a second place for the Upgrade. We couldn't shout it out with Rose because Rose wasn't the main conduit person. So I needed to wait for Jay to for us to say thank you. I was blown away just just to be included. I mean, one, the list itself was absolutely phenomenal. So shout out to the other shows, the other new shows. And to be included on that just warmed my heart. It didn't warm my vocal chords, apparently. But, you know, what are you going to do? You're talking a lot better than you were before. So it's just a long process. And so it's a process. Did you know that there's a process to how we do these shout outs? People within the Relay FM community. Obviously, some of these were a little personal. But if you're doing something amazing and you're in the Relay FM community, especially if you subscribe to Conduit and you're a part of the Conduit Conductor family, then we keep an eye out for those awesome things. And we will shout you out. We'll let you know. We'll let the world know how awesome you are and the cool things that you're doing. And if you want to become one of those people, just go to Relay. FM slash Conduit. And I'm going to let Kathy say all the important bits from now on, because I feel like something gets lost in translations every time. You're doing great. You're doing so good. Yeah. So go to Relay. FM slash Conduit and sign up for membership there. Once there, not only do we get direct support from your money, but you get to join the incredible Discord community where you can hang out with all of the other really cool people and also be a part of our live show right now. That we are recording live in the Discord. But if you are not in the Discord, you can't message us. Yeah, that, you know, mind, if you're listening to this now and you're not in the live chat with us, that means you're listening to the recorded edited version that comes out on Thursdays. But most of the time we record on Tuesdays and you get the live show to chat with us and you can do fun requests like asking Jay to say in a world gone mad. And that's just one of the many, many amazing pieces that you get to enjoy as a member of the Relay FM Connection Conduit Conductor family. And that is. Yeah. And well, I guess the last thing there is we do have some future plans as well. I tried to do Evil, Evil Doctor voice on that one, but it didn't work out well. But, you know. Can I get an evil laugh from you? You really can't. My voice likes this register and this one only. So ha ha ha. That's that's about as good as it gets. But you know what you can get? Zap. Yeah. Almost as good as mine. So this is where we do our connection checks. My connection check was to remove X number of dollars from my monthly budget for reasons that I'm not ready to talk about. But soon, soon, I promise soon. Yeah, I I did a thing and I removed a certain number. That number was an X. I don't think it's a problem, but I'm definitely going to go like yellow dot on this one that the effort was there. But the I don't I don't know that the something was missing and that something got me lower than what I wanted to. But like I said, I don't think it's going to be necessarily a problem. I just think it means I have to spend more time thinking about it. And yeah, that's that's kind of it for me right now. Well, and that's you know, we'll we'll get into it a little bit more in a future episode. But you're doing an incredible job and I'm really proud of you. And just the thinking sometimes can be enough when there's a lot of balls in the air. And there is only so much that you actually can do and get started. So I feel like someone's told me that before. I know it seems like it was yesterday when someone was talking to me. When someone was telling me about all the things in the air. No, that couldn't be. I save all of our conversations for the podcast. We definitely don't talk outside of the podcast because that would just be silly. Speaking of silly, I heard you have a new innovative way of collecting things. Yeah. So my whole idea for an inbox was kind of ideas and things that I needed to keep track of. And while I have that now, I have something a little bit more complex as well that I'm excited to talk about. But that's going to be part of our topic. So I'm going to save that. Just know that this is a green checkbox and I'm feeling very content and happy with my connection. And I'm also feeling really happy with our conductors connection checks. We got our pop of the show came in to say that Papa Tibbs is planning is good. The big whiteboard in the garage with goals for the year. And as a member of the discord, we got to see that whiteboard, which is very exciting, but also put a schedule laid out of the newsletter. And then the next step is working on marketing funnels and actually writing the stuff. Now, let me say funnels. It may have fun in the name. But to me personally, I don't find them fun, but they can definitely be seen as fun to some people. So I'm excited to see you. I'm one of those people that thinks it's fun. So, yeah, if you want to if you want to talk about marketing, like talk to the person that does that for a living, kind of, sort of, and has done it for a while. So, yeah, happy to chat about that in the future. What about from Kate? Arcade of the show, our singer of the artists of the show, artists of the show. We have a spreadsheet, folks, and people change their names a lot. And when they do, we have to try to follow. And Kate didn't change her name or their name. And it's throwing me off. So, Kate, I'm asking you to change your name so that I can make sure I keep up with all the changes that are happening, which will make the ones that are not happening easier to follow. Anyway, Kate of the show, whatever artists of the show. Yeah, I mean, it is the state of the show. They said connection check. I haven't finished any of the sections of the dissertation quite as much as I was hoping for, but have some words for all of them and realize I actually have three weeks till due. Not to so I can still make the connection happen. Hey, I like it. You're it's in progress. Even if we you know, even if it's like a little behind schedule, at least you see that and you know it. And maybe you can shuffle some things, get it back on track as long as those things aren't playing cards, because if you shuffle cards, you will probably play with them. And that will mean you're not getting the work that you want to get done so. Unless you're shuffling the cards as a means to have like a fidget toy while your brain works. Oh, that's a good one. I like it. Yeah. So like if you're if you're shuffling your cards, that's OK. That's a valid way to get your stuff done, because I'm proud of you, Kate. You know, being able to look at this optimistically, even just the the connection checks that you've done over the period of this dissertation. I can feel the optimism coming in as you're getting closer and closer to the end, as opposed to like really, really stressed. So I'm really proud of you. You're doing an incredible job. And I can't wait to see what happens next. I love it. And what what's happening next in the show is let's have a chat about our sponsor, shall we? This episode of Conduit is brought to you by Timing, the intelligent time tracking app you can trust. Whether you're billing by the hour, employed or billing per project, you might need to estimate how long a task is going to take. Or maybe you just want a better understanding of where your time goes so you can make some positive changes. Time tracking helps you stay on track with those estimates to make sure you don't end up in the red with your projects and to make more accurate estimates in the future. But in today's work environment, work changes so quickly you can't start and stop a timer for everything. The good news is your computer already knows what you do. So why not have it track time for you? Timing automatically tracks everything you do on your Mac without having to lift a finger. You can trust it to always give you the complete picture. Timing will detect when you are in a video call and lets you record what the meeting was about afterwards. And there's even more magic like this in timing to make recording your time as easy as possible. Plus, you can enjoy the activity screen, which presents your app usage, including websites, file paths and window titles. And if you want to, you can start and stop timers from within the main timing app itself. And if you are collaborating with colleagues, Timing's Teams feature lets you share projects with them and record everyone's time in a central location, which lets managers get a quick overview of where their team members spend their time while preserving their privacy, because which apps, documents and websites each team members use stays private and is not visible to managers. Plus, with a super slick onboarding process, everyone will be up to speed in no time. Kathy, I have to tell you that like I used timing yesterday, like quite literally those that know me. I do a lot of like freelance work for some people. And every year I look at how much time I'm spending versus how much I'm charging. And it's always easier to tell a client like, hey, I thought I would be spending five hours a month with you. But instead, timing tells me I've actually been spending 15. So we might need to talk about a budget, like a rate adjustment there a little bit. So to me, timing is usually the source of truth. It is the thing that I know. And the best part is I don't have to do anything. I just work. I just do the things. And when I go, huh, I wonder how long that took. I then jump into timing. It also helps me identify my processes. So if I think I'm only spending five minutes on a website and I'm actually spending 20, that means I know that I need to stop wasting my time and start actually moving the ball forward. So timing is great whether you're having to talk with clients or if you just need to adjust your own internal systems a little bit. Amazing.

So, Kathy, a couple of things. One, it's the new year. And I know that was is this the first show of the year? Is it? I don't know. I don't. Yes. Time is hard. What is time? Man, if only I had, you know, timing to come and tell me what time it is. I think you could just use your phone for that. But I know that in most cases, the the new year means a lot. And we've had plenty of shows on Relay FM talk about all of the themes and the stuff and the things that we're doing and the goals and the resolutions. And, you know, can this just be a place where we're OK with what we're doing and just do it the way that we do it? I mean, yes, but also no. I mean, OK, so, yes, we can. However, it's also OK if you want to try and work on something to make your life easier or better. And I think that it's important to really have a good balance between starting the new year off with kind of hope for the future and ideas and dreams and like, what can I make it look like? But also with an understanding and awareness of kind of where you're currently at and what is good for you and what feels good for you. So I did a little bit of a sneak peek of my yearly theme on this last week's episode of Roboism. So feel free to check that out. But my yearly theme this year is the Year of Joyful Ease. I want to bring things into my life that bring joy and are easier. And the combination of the two is something that is where I'm concentrating on. So I have a terrible memory. I don't remember a lot of things. And so I have a big whiteboard on my wall that has my yearly theme. So I remember what it is. If I had a bunch of resolutions or like individual goals to look at and try and remember and keep my awareness on it, it wouldn't work because I don't have that space in my brain. But being able to have just this one sentence that's like, hey, this is the goals. This is kind of where my mindset is going to try and be at this year. I am I can more easily use it as a guideline to make decisions. I I want. To have this concentration on joy, but I didn't want it just to be the year of joy, because I can find I can find things that are joyful everywhere, but I want to make it easier for me to do it. Yeah, I'm sorry. Kathy Kondo can't doing it. Oh, yes. What sparks joy and a lot of systems and processes spark joy for me in the right in the right way by making things easier. And so one of those things that I did through the help with Rose is making a daily review that also works with progressing down the stages to have a weekly review, monthly review, quarterly review and a yearly review with the reminders and automatics automation set up so that it's really easy to do. It's really easy to process without having to have a lot of energy put into it. And if I skip it today, that's OK, too. Like, it's not a be all end all. Oh, my goodness, the world is going to explode if I don't do this. But I want to be able to remember more of my days in the future without having it pop up on my time hop app that says, oh, hey, this is what you did five years ago. OK, cool. But what if I wanted to know what I did last week? And I don't remember. So. That is my yearly theme and the complicated to set up, but easy to use system utilizes apps that I chose, not because I wanted to use them necessarily, but because they are the easiest ones to make it do the thing that I want. And I know that we we wanted to talk a little bit about kind of like our app strategy, not just individually, but from the podcast as a whole. Like. It's important that we come in here and are like, hey, however you do your work, however you get through your day is the right way to do it if you're happy with it and that there is no one true app. We're not going to come in here and say, oh, my goodness, the only way to do track your tasks is with OmniFocus. And if you don't use OmniFocus, well, then you just can't be productive. We don't we don't talk about apps. No, no, no, no. Except for when we're talking about an app that has a very specific process in how we're using it. When I'm choosing apps for my own function, I like to kind of look at why I want to use it. Is it the fun, coolest thing to do? I mean, yes, sometimes I do get FOMO and I'm like, oh, I need to purchase this app and use it. Which is like there's nothing wrong with that. If you're if you're doing it with an awareness that, hey, this app will not necessarily change your life unless it's the app that is doing exactly what you need it to do. So that's kind of where we're at with that. And in this process, thanks to Rose, I have and now utilizing shortcuts and focus mode workspace and drafts and obsidian all in one in a way that, you know, a month ago, I was not using any of them. So that feels very weird to me to be like, OK, I'm all in on this. But also, it works really, really well. Oh, and I guess technically I'm using do to remind me to do the things because but I already do use that app. So what I'm hearing is. You've you've set some some expectations for these applications, and if they don't meet them, that's OK. You just need to find something else. But the expectation isn't. Changed my life radically. You the system itself is probably also not going to change the life radically, but it might change. You know, it might change the life. And I think that I mean, one, whatever app you choose, I mean, like I said, I used timing, blah, blah, blah. Our sponsor of the show to do to do these great things that make a difference in my life. But it's not the only way I track my time. I use I have three ways of tracking my time at different levels. And in order to do that, I had to identify with myself of like, what is the expectation that I have for my system, for myself, for whatever app I'm choosing, like what is that expectation? And make that expectation not so great that it like obviously just falls on its face. And I think that's that's kind of what pushes me to the no expectations route of the quote unquote new year or new time period of themes and goals. But I love that you've been able to create a system based off of a theme that sounds fun, you know, to be fair, like it sounds like there's a lot of stuff there. And the fact that you got to you got to plan it and work on it with Rose. Like, yeah, Rose, if you want to just give me, you know, 30 minutes to bounce ideas and talk on Amations, I'm always happy to do that. So I can definitely see it being fun. One of the things you mentioned was simpler. Do you see a way to make it simpler? Do you think it's simple enough as it is? I think if if I had to come in from scratch without having access to Rose and create this thing from scratch and have to test a bunch of functionality and try and make something work the way I needed to work, it would be so much more difficult and so much more convoluted. But because I had access to somebody that knew what I wanted to do and knew what it could do with these pieces, it was really, really helpful. I think the only so like right now, my my daily review takes maybe a minute. The only thing that could maybe make it simpler was some sort of combination of connecting the alert with running the shortcut. So like at six o'clock when the alert comes up, I can just tap it and it will go and run that shortcut for me. I don't know if that's possible. And it probably isn't. Oh, hey, we could create an app for this. Is it possible? Yes, it is. OK, well, we're going to talk about that later, because I do also like the the fact that if I'm in the middle of something, I can just tap the reminder and do to go like later and then. But my review workspace changes to have just a single wallpaper, like this. The single home screen is just drafts at the top, and then it has the shortcuts for daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. So I can just tap it and it will run through the process of asking the questions and then load the the document wherever it needs to be loaded. But we're talk we're going to talk about making it easier in the future. That would be cool. However, either way, like making it easy is, again, the point. I want to make this easy so that I do it. But also so it doesn't take a huge like I can't sit down and spend two hours writing what happened in my day. Like, that's not easy. That's not joyful. That doesn't like fit my need. And this kind of does. So I'm excited to kind of have this be that first piece in my year and see how it goes and see how it will inspire future things, too. I definitely think that there's a conversation around like outsourcing. And I don't mean that necessarily in like the realm of like, I'm going to give somebody ten dollars, but it's like feed feeding them, feeding them the thing that they're passionate about. Because when you said tinkering with this for two hours is not fun, I was like, but it is, though. No, exactly. So that's the thing is like you want a solution. Some people want a problem and you can work with them to to give them the problems and then maybe solve some of the other issues that maybe they don't want and figure it out. And I think that that's like a a good team like planning. There's so many buzzwords that I can throw in there that I'm going to just ignore. But no, I'm I'm really excited. I I love seeing some something like grow and like kind of bud and develop over time. So getting to getting to be witness to this is like absolutely amazing for me. So I'm looking forward to hearing about it more. Yeah. So I guess it's my turn. Yes. Well, let's let's get one thing addressed, I guess. So, yes, I have ADHD. I will forget what I had for lunch in a few hours. So that being said, I struggle with doing anything with a long term objective, even if it's written down, even if it's in front of me, even if it's like staring me at the in the face. Like Kathy and I go through the steps every week just to make sure that we don't leave a stone unturned. That's why I like checklists. That's why I like, you know, process point one point one point one point one point one point one point one. A lot of those things are to make sure that I'm not forgetting something. So the idea of adding to that is. Very, very anxiety creating. So Jay doesn't do a system or a theme and doesn't do resolutions or goals. Instead, what I do is to quote and I've kind of teased it a little bit to quote Spider-Man. I give myself the no expectations. Some might call it flying by the seat of their pants. Others, others may call it just, you know, live in life day by day. You know, all that all that fun stuff. Don't get it wrong that I don't ever plan or I don't ever have a goal. I just don't have them for me. What I've learned is the more I try to force it, the less likely it's going to happen. When I'm working professionally, we have milestones that we can hit that are, you know, we calculate them and then we set them. And then when they happen, a little notification pops up and we go, yay, we did it. But when Jay is looking and I say when I'm looking at like what I'm doing, it's really hard to come up with like, this is going to be the thing that means that this is a successful whatever for me. And that includes, you know, the success of Conduit as a show. That includes me as, you know, someone who writes code for a living and talks to people for a living like I am often more impressed with what I what I do. Looking back, then trying to reach something looking forward. So for me, I often take this time and look and see like, OK, what did I do and was I happy with it or not? And if I'm not happy, like, that's fine. Just just don't do less of that. And if and if you do less of that, then like, OK, cool. You know, call that a theme or goal or whatever. But like, I'm not I'm not going to get tied down in the minutia of it. A good example of this was I spoke at. I gave 14 talks at 13 different events professionally this past year, and part of me says that was a lot. You need to do less of that. Maybe you can do more of the other thing. Just figure out what those other things are and just do them like, you know, like, and that's kind of it. That's as far as it goes. I'm not I'm not going to say this time it needs to be seven or ten or 13. It's more just going to be to less. Do less of that. Do more of the thing that you want to do. And just leave it there. I think that's that's more of a of a, you know, optimistic planning for the year than you think it is, because hearing hearing you say, oh, I want to do you know, I did X number of talks last year and I want to do less this next year. How do you remember that you want to do less? Well, and again, that's why I do like collect those metrics. Like I can look at my bullet journal and say, like, oh, I gave 13 talks. Like that's there's like a page that talks about like, OK, what did you do professionally that you want to change? And a lot of this is also keeping up with like, you know, I have to do annual reviews and stuff at work and expressing this everywhere. Like and I think that's the hard part for me is that, you know, where I want to do less of the talks, I want to spend more time outside with my family. Like and I want to have more events with conduit and conduit related things. And I want to, you know, talk to more people online. So like it's it's not just doing less. It's doing more of the things that I want to do and like writing it down. But also if I give 15 talks next year, I don't consider that a failure as long as I'm not like, oh, I'm even more tired than before. Like if I can figure out how to do more and be equally as fulfilled, then like I'm OK with it. I just personally at the moment don't believe that that's possible. And I would need someone to really convince me otherwise. But I I don't like the idea that I'm beholden to a thing long enough that I need to make it law in the realm in my realm or in my existence. Interesting. That sounded really sarcastic. I swear I did not trust me. If you think things sound weird, you should hear my voice. Oh, believe me, Jay, I am. So in my in my mind, I totally understand that idea of like rigidness and that structure of, oh, it's either a win or a loss or, you know, as specific goals that you're reaching for. And that's why a lot of times I really I hated resolutions. I hated this idea of, oh, these are the things that you're going to do this year. And if you don't, then you're not successful. That's why I really enjoyed this idea of yearly themes, not because like if you get through the year, you're successful. Like you that is that is the overall goal is to kind of last the year. And if I get to a point where things have been able to happen, even better. And to be fair, I I did used to try like themes, but the themes just kept changing. And I think that's why that's why I never wanted to subscribe to it. Because, I mean, at one point, it was like, OK, what's the weekly theme? Like, can I just give myself let me last for this week thinking about this thing? And then I just forget to do it. And then like, yeah, that that is a wash. Well, something something like a quarterly theme, though, might be helpful with just that one word of, you know, ease or calm or peace or something to kind of like slow down a little bit. But I know that right now is not the best time to have something like that. But it also could maybe be a good time to kind of remind yourself of like those those little goals, the little things. And very much the, you know, the the bullet journaling part of my system does that a lot. I mean, and again, the way that I am able to keep some level of success while not subscribing to like I need to do a thing is through reflection. There's a lot of reflection that has to happen on a regular basis. And like those weekly reviews, for lack of a better phrase, aren't like a planning thing. It's like, take a look at what you did, like really look at it and and, you know, be. I don't want to say subjective, but be critical of what you did and why you did those things and and give them value. And, you know, next week, there's going to be new things that come up. And, you know, you've got things coming up in the in the future that you need to plan for and start working on those. And when you get to the month or you get to the year, like it gets so fun because you get to just go back and like go through going through my bullet journal recently at the beginning of the year, I got to see like conduit coming to life and becoming a thing. And there was no theme that predicted that there was. There was like nothing in my list of expectations that I had for myself that was like, you're going to do this show with Kathy Campbell. That's going to be super amazing and awesome. It was like, oh, hey, it would be really cool to do new projects and things like that. And I mean, I'm going to I'm going to fight you, not fight you because we're friends. I'm going to strongly disagree with that statement because my yearly theme last year was the year to bloom. And I strongly feel that conduit was part of that. And it was it was it just wasn't my yearly theme. No, it's true. But but something like that. I don't know if I would have been mentally strong enough to be able to say yes to the project that I really wanted to do. If I didn't have that mindset in my head. I agree with that. And I think that that's the the overall feeling that we wanted to to get across. And even when I said at the beginning, can we just like exist the way that we are doing the things that we're doing? Like if that is creating a theme that gives you the courage and energy and motivation to do new things, that's good. Like that's real good. We really like that. But also, if you're in a season of your life where surviving the day and not giving yourself any expectations beyond surviving the day or the week or the month of the year, whatever, like that's perfectly good to. Abs absolutely. And like a yearly theme of rest and reminding yourself to to rest can be really helpful. I've been in that season of my life, and I'm so thankful that I'm no longer there, but it's still very present in my mind and is is a completely valid and supported idea if all you need to do is get through the pandemic, because let's be honest, like it's it's hard. It's it's rough going out there. And so any way that we can support you, let us know because we're here to help and not tell you that how you're doing it is wrong, unless you're me telling Jay that it's OK. But that's fine. Kathy tells me I'm wrong more than you think. We got consent. You know, it's a it's an open. I I I I invited I actually will message Kathy from time to time and say, I need your critical feedback on ideas. And that's like I need you to tell me why I'm wrong, because I don't see it. But that doesn't mean that it's not there. And one of the things that I will say is I do hold myself accountable to some things like my connections. So for me, thinking about just what needs to get done and like focusing on doing that is in some ways my my theme, at least for the next two weeks, even if I can't make that last an entire year. I love it. My connection for the next fortnight is making my office a little bit more joyful and easy. There's pieces and things that I've wanted to put up or do since we moved months ago that I haven't done. And I deserve it for myself. So I'm going to take some time over the next two weeks to kind of solidify my space, how I want slash need it so that it will work and make me happy. I love that. And and I love that. Now that you've bloomed your pruning, that's absolutely amazing. I still don't know what my connection is. So we're we're going on the fly here. My connection is to find peace and have a conversation with myself. Like I said, we'll talk about it a little bit in future episodes. But a lot of stuff happened aside from getting sick. A lot of stuff happened for me at the end of last year that I don't really have a lot of control over. And I want to just make sure I'm OK with that and that I'm not like using my Bell's gift of denial to to like mask some feelings. I'm not going to promise that it will include a mental health professional because there are a lot of people asking me to do that at the moment. And like the pressure of that is a thing. But I do promise I've been doing really good with going on my walks and getting actual sunlight instead of the artificial stuff. So there might be one of those where I cry a lot or I talk to myself a lot and people will think I'm insane and it'll be OK. But I think that that's something that I can commit to doing at least once in the next two weeks and is probably really neat. I think that sounds perfect. And I'm so excited for you. And I'm also excited for down under the show, Ellen, whose connection is for the next while to get everything wrapped up as best they can in their old position before diving head first into the new one at the end of the week should be busy. Sorry, Ellen, that was me being really excited, but also trying not to like have my voice crack a lot. Yeah, I was like, no, I this is the correct connection. I read it in this the the document that we put there. Like, it's right. The name is is there. So don't mess it up. And Kate, the Kate artist of the show. Yeah, that's right. That's that's who that is. So their connection for the next week or so is to finish the sections, but also to be kind to themselves about it. So if what I work on for a day is the layout, more visual stuff, then that's OK, because it means that they won't have to spend time on it later. And yes, I love that. And I think that that is that is the culmination of what we've kind of been talking about this whole time of like have a plan. If you get punched in the face and that plan doesn't work out, then come up with a new plan and just do that instead. It's fine. It's good. Everything's great. And what's not great right now is Jay's voice. So I'm going to ask him, Jay, did we can do it? Well, thanks to our sponsor for this week's episode, Timing and also some great conversations. I totally think we can did it. Heck, yeah.
