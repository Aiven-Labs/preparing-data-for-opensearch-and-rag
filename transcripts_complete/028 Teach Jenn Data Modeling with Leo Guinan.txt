Hello beautiful humans welcome back to another episode of Teach Gen Tech and I will say I think this is the first time I actually started it right when it said to go live instead of me going oh shit we forgot something I need to finish this though So welcome back Leo for those who didn't join last week we talked a lot of theory of data modeling and we stumbled our way I'm half flying pens we stumbled our way into me finding out that I could really use a data model for my podcasting process and creating content for that so we are going to use that as an example and we will yeah that's that's where I got to and Leo please introduce yourself
So welcome back Leo for those who didn't join last week we talked a lot of theory of data modeling and we stumbled our way I'm half flying pens we stumbled our way into me finding out that I could really use a data model for my podcasting process and creating content for that so we are going to use that as an example and we will yeah that's that's where I got to and Leo please introduce yourself Yes so I am a software engineer currently with Copy AI for kind of the day job and then building a number of products on the side I'm also kind of a all-around creator working on a book podcasts plural YouTube channels a little bit of everything so if you want details on any that you can check it out at Twitter that's probably the that's where I'm most active and kind of it's my hub for everything so but yeah happy to be back it should be fun and practical
Yes so I am a software engineer currently with Copy AI for kind of the day job and then building a number of products on the side I'm also kind of a all-around creator working on a book podcasts plural YouTube channels a little bit of everything so if you want details on any that you can check it out at Twitter that's probably the that's where I'm most active and kind of it's my hub for everything so but yeah happy to be back it should be fun and practical Yes and I think that's one of the best parts about this show is it is a lot about theory but a lot of it is also about the practical use of it and that's a big reason I will link and also thank you for helping me figure out what I was actually trying to say about data modeling and my article instead of the very convoluted way I wrote it
Yes and I think that's one of the best parts about this show is it is a lot about theory but a lot of it is also about the practical use of it and that's a big reason I will link and also thank you for helping me figure out what I was actually trying to say about data modeling and my article instead of the very convoluted way I wrote it Yeah no worries it's one of those things it's like it's kind of awkward to talk about especially because you know as I kind of pointed out like there's two definitions of data models right like there's the data models that are actually like talking about like what you're trying to model and kind of like modeling real world objects and then there's like the more like formal definition of data models and kind of how they are set up and kind of the relationships between them and so using the term can just be confusing kind of by nature got a lot of words like that so yeah I hope the practical kind of exercise of going through it will like help everybody just kind of see what's going on
Yeah no worries it's one of those things it's like it's kind of awkward to talk about especially because you know as I kind of pointed out like there's two definitions of data models right like there's the data models that are actually like talking about like what you're trying to model and kind of like modeling real world objects and then there's like the more like formal definition of data models and kind of how they are set up and kind of the relationships between them and so using the term can just be confusing kind of by nature got a lot of words like that so yeah I hope the practical kind of exercise of going through it will like help everybody just kind of see what's going on Yeah for sure and good morning or afternoon everyone homey I know it's morning your time I believe so in the chat I'm trying to keep up with chat and also copy and paste everything where it goes for those the blog I was talking about that that I got input on is right here and then I will pop out the chat now that I know I can do that and very exciting because then I'm not missing everybody's stuff
Yeah for sure and good morning or afternoon everyone homey I know it's morning your time I believe so in the chat I'm trying to keep up with chat and also copy and paste everything where it goes for those the blog I was talking about that that I got input on is right here and then I will pop out the chat now that I know I can do that and very exciting because then I'm not missing everybody's stuff There you go. I still kind of do I'm not going to lie I still kind of do. That's all good. We have blushing. Hey blushing how's it going? What a blushing and hi Jay. Yay. Oh that's fun. Jay yay. Yay
There you go. I still kind of do I'm not going to lie I still kind of do. That's all good. We have blushing. Hey blushing how's it going? What a blushing and hi Jay. Yay. Oh that's fun. Jay yay. Yay Jay yay. Yay. Homey I don't have some okay we're not going down a rhyming thing today it's not going to blushing crushing hey that one kind of works though. Blushing is crushing it. I don't know. Blushing is crushing it
Jay yay. Yay. Homey I don't have some okay we're not going down a rhyming thing today it's not going to blushing crushing hey that one kind of works though. Blushing is crushing it. I don't know. Blushing is crushing it Y'all I will totally admit that I have been running around like a chicken with my head cut off so that and my ADHD self is on fire this morning if you need me to slow down and stop being so all over the board please give me a post and I'm working on adjusting the screen I can show everybody that I'm working on adjusting the screen
Y'all I will totally admit that I have been running around like a chicken with my head cut off so that and my ADHD self is on fire this morning if you need me to slow down and stop being so all over the board please give me a post and I'm working on adjusting the screen I can show everybody that I'm working on adjusting the screen Do you do you do you do okay so I feel like this is might be the best way of doing it. I don't know. Should work. We can try it and if it doesn't work then we can try something different
Do you do you do you do okay so I feel like this is might be the best way of doing it. I don't know. Should work. We can try it and if it doesn't work then we can try something different All right so I do not have a great way of talking through and everybody watching please let me know if I need to zoom this in more. I do not have a great way of figuring out how to make content for the podcast that I completely froze like I'm not doing anything
All right so I do not have a great way of talking through and everybody watching please let me know if I need to zoom this in more. I do not have a great way of figuring out how to make content for the podcast that I completely froze like I'm not doing anything I have episodes backlogged that all I have to do is upload them but I'm like so overwhelmed and stuck that I haven't like no touchy touchy and it just now it's so big of a monster that I'm like I know I need to do it I don't know where to start and this is I would say kind of like a start on data modeling yeah it's kind of outlining the workflow and I think that that's really great and when it comes to actually like where to start the modeling process because again you can run into the same issue right I can we could just start at the beginning but one of the things that I like to do I like to start with two questions so first of all what is the is there a place that you tend to forget to do a step because I know the ADHD that's something that this is how I pretty much function every time as soon as I forget to do do do something I can pretty much guarantee I'm going to forget to do it again because ADHD and so I work a way to automate that step as much as possible so I can't forget so either it's an automation of the step itself or it's an automated alert that if I forget the step it'll let me know and not let me continue so that's kind of the one approach and then the the second place that I like to start is any place that is just like time consuming is there is there a bottleneck in the process somewhere because again kind of from the ADHD perspective right it's like knowing that there's something time consuming it doesn't have to be hard but it's just kind of painful in that sense right it just takes up so much time and so it stops from doing it and so that's where I like to start in the process and just say like hey where are the biggest pain points and you know when it comes to building products as well this is a good way to design products instead of focusing on like what you think the world looks like start with like the problem where is the problem and then kind of you know move out from there so I find this a helpful process so if you've got a place that that fits either of those I think that would be a good place to start all right and that being said like um bring me for that explanation because I think that does make a lot of sense I think for myself is I'm stuck on social I'm like stuck at the end um because I know I need to plan stuff from the beginning but I'm like oh shit like this I need like an audiogram or graphics or um you know where am I uploading am I doing something with patreon and my and these are all thoughts that I'm like it's terrifying because I've realized if I don't do social media no one's going to find out about the podcast it's not it's a it's definitely a niche it is not teach shentech it's a lot easier to get traction yeah and that's um so that's a good point so we can start with social media then because I think that's good so the first thing I would do is I would break that down into what social media platforms you care about that way you know social media is kind of a broad term um so if we break that out into the the various platforms that you use that will probably be like a good bit easier and y'all uh I like it Jay you just don't do any social I don't blame you um I definitely don't blame you it's so this was the beginning of me trying to figure out social because I have four projects and so we're just gonna skip the other ones because the only one that I'm mostly doing for social is teach shentech because people won't show up and I'm like I want people to show up this is good content to learn so for the podcast which is called shit you don't want to talk about so if you see the word shit that is why it's not shit it is actually really good um but it's twitter linkedin instagram and tectalk okay so um you know that kind of tells me that we we probably need like four different flows right and so you know in kind of breaking this out I like to get it down to you know as simple as possible right like just a very simple workflow because then we can come back and we can actually like um make composite workflows that are built up of the um workflows that you kind of broken apart right um so yeah let's start let's just start with twitter um we don't even need to worry about the rest of it so we'll just start with twitter um so what kind of content do you have to push out to twitter ee okay uh now i'm just like totally frozen i would say some of the content is the same across platforms um so like episode announcements and episode um live there we go that's what i'll call it and then I have you know past episodes uh pauses like um pauses to contribute to or important hot topics and do hot topic just because hot topic i really want to start it belt uh yeah i know that's why i was just thinking about it so the young me that always wanted to look like a really cool email punk goth kid it never happened but i finally got the purple hair i was like the purple hair at rocks and it like matches the whole like twitch stream which i think is fantastic like it's very color coordinated thank you thank you and i actually used to have like a ton of facial piercings and worked at sponsors for a number of years so um yeah no i'm right there with you like i i was right there and all of that so uh but yeah i think it is too words to go back to the original um yes and thank you Ben for commenting my hair um it is also something that i'm pretty sure and Ben this is before i knew you so i'm like i think it was Ben but i'm not 100% sure that he was posting stuff in um one of the discord and i was like trying to model my stuff like kept like seen other people's graphics i'm not sure it was two and a half months ago that was a long time ago i don't remember all right what else do i need to post on twitter oh um something i'm supposed to be posting there too and not is uh when's when red miss day twitter spaces putter space how's it going Ben um yeah uh so okay so i see a couple different things um popping out right and so this is why it's always helpful to like go through this process because now i see so we've got kind of the um announcements right and so there's something happening at a specific time um and so you know you want to be able to alert people that it's live um and then there's kind of the like discussion category right um so that's like the hot topic uh causes what do we want to get into um so that that's kind of an interactive thing um and then like past episodes um i would say is kind of uh let's see i guess we can call it like archive right and so that that's kind of a just something we can kind of like reach back and pull things out from from the past to kind of get people interested into what's going on right um and so kind of looking at this here um so you know if we start breaking it down and kind of just start thinking about what we might want to do um for the announcements because i think that's probably the easiest right um um and uh so you know we've kind of got the um event name right um we could probably say like uh event i'm gonna say category that may not be the best word but you know kind of in terms of like so you've got like the four different projects right um so you probably want to categorize that oh um project maybe project might be better um just uh some way to campaign there we go yeah it's the it's the marketing term for it yes that's an excellent one yeah um okay i know i'm totally making a slowdown because i'm trying to organize this to where i can like do it again no no it's cool and i think that is a really handy thing to do um and i do that pretty much with everything i do like the first time i do something i tried to go through it slower to make it more repeatable in the future because then it's more likely that i'll do it again in the future again ADHD got to play tricks so with ourselves right like we've got to make it as easy as possible on our future selves yes yes okay so you were saying for announcements it's like um um i could do this you need me so it's at least for this announcement it would be campaign uh i really so campaigned to me is saying yeah what what uh like project it is like you said but i do think that i need to start putting tags like on hey this is this topic so i probably separate that out into something else so that that's that was actually the next thing on my uh list that i was just thinking about um because the tags could actually be shared between campaigns right yeah because there is a lot of overlap in in the the different things so i think tags are important so but campaigns so would i put campaign on like each of them or that's like a hierarchy like up here kind of thing like all of them needs to be in the hands um yeah i would say that that's probably shared between all of them okay and so uh that's are also shared right um yeah because like trying to figure out hashtags is interesting just to say the least yes i just i'm pretty curious um because of that it's like i don't know it to you so i'm just not gonna use any or i'll create my own and then nobody will use it except for me and that's fine too uh java script and js get retweeted by bots i know and it's amazing because it does get more visibility i know although i do feel really bad if i use like hundred devs because i'm like i'm not doing that program i shouldn't use that the hashtag but it gets retweeted but it's also helpful for people in the hundred devs community right and that's kind of the thing so if it's something that they're interested in learning um i actually love the hundred devs community i've had a lot of coffee chats with people from there and i think it's a fantastic group but um that that's that's on the side there okay so an episode would have an episode uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh well where do i put um like episodes content like i should know the episode name and everything by this point so i would be using like episode title and one liner okay so we've got like a title and a description which i think and yeah like i title is probably i said kind of like event name right but yeah title is um but yeah the description is handy um and then you know the i think the the date of it is probably helpful for people to show up maybe well these ones um when the episodes are live i mean that they go live that day it's oh god i see these names they are like they come they're supposed to come out on Wednesdays cool um so okay that that makes sense um and so you know i was thinking of like the the event is live not like yeah you know but anyway it's it's it's about the same right it's actually um episode heirs episode there we go um and then so yeah that um and then i feel like i can make these smaller to also work better and then because these would also need to go to this one and this one oh i definitely need to like move stuff around um this one would also have date because it's a twitter space right by great i do mean great in time i feel like they can be lumped together that sounds good um okay so and oh sorry i just for remembered one that i'm really bad at and um tagging people we talked about this and if we want to create something that can tag people i would i would love that but i need to tag all the humans so we can absolutely create something that does that that's going to be a one day thing i like that we're starting to have like repeat repeat i almost said repeat customers repeat guests uh bends coming on once a month to talk about accessibility and excellent jay will be on at some point he has a talk tomorrow and just raised money yesterday nice i was watching that live stream for a bit all right so we uh so yeah let's see um is there anything else you like to include in those in those two specifically um oh yes uh graphic oh great oh dope if i can make it i totally will i really like watching other people's live streams because even like especially people i know it's like it's kind of like what what is it called again the um buddy system not buddy system body doubling yeah hotty doubling and it's very calming and i learn so much so much so true um but oh you're not doing a stream you're doing it while you're watching okay that's fair you do cool things we'll use dream too or first part of doubling here what are we going all right so we have episode airs we need the title description and graphic okay and Wednesdays uh is title description date and time and tag all the humans so for the the twitter space um in terms of tagging humans are they people who have been there before are they people that you expect to be there where are we getting the humans um the humans are magical creatures that just showed up enough that i started tagging them or they requested to be tagged all right i have a very ad hoc list of people that i try to uh like tag across all of them like i i i've had to create i think three posts yesterday and three posts today just to try to get everybody tagged for tomorrow's twitter space and um but i mean like the Wednesday twitter space is technically like uh uh my social media thing but the podcast definitely needs to start doing it too because it's where my two lives overlap right okay well that's something to think about because we can um you know think about good ways to do that because there are limits on kind of how many people you can tag and like but if we have the idea of tagging people i think um that that would be useful right and so human tags as opposed to topic tags yeah oh that's a great way of uh saying that it's the problem like words just start overlapping and you're like okay well now i'm using the same word for like multiple things and that just that gets tricky um i'm gonna pause this really quick yes and say jay i watched owls um stream last night and i didn't want to get booted so i was like yo can i uh like talk about other people so i totally talked about you and just tagged your twitter space uh or your twitter and you do cool things so everybody should like basically anybody that's like hanging out with us you should just go follow them so if y'all want to just like drop your twitter's do it because everybody's really does cool things here so everyone should be friends it's just where i'm at all right go with you so uh these are created from uh requests tag requests yeah like people asking to be on it to be tagged right so i was looking i was looking at blushing's question that i don't i don't know the answer to that um wait the links looks like it showed up um well i think just anybody who drops links in the chat are not getting deleted by about if they don't subscribe or maybe they do subscribe i don't know i'm super new to twitch so i'm just trying to like oh me too i understand it Ben might know this one or Jay or i'm just trying to think uh i i honestly have reached out to you Ben so many times about um twitch that that's just my go-to person but i probably other people know too i was gonna say blushing's probably one of the more experienced twitch streamers here too so it might be a setting or something i don't know or perhaps it just works um but you should totally go follow uh blushing i will totally uh vouch for for everything she does there blushing we're gonna be friends it's gonna happen and i will follow you after this maybe let's see how i i'm i'm getting confused so i'm not going to i'm working on focusing today because we have to stop at the end of the hour all right um so tag requests that's how i get tagged all the humans is the request and i so just out of to know that i have to create something here i'm just gonna put um need to create list process to do the things of tagging yeah that's that's good um the nice thing is like we can just like these chains can go on forever and we can kind of like do it so um you know it's okay to just like stop and be like that's good enough for now um yeah and uh okay cool so let's actually go down to the bottom and see what we've got for these two right all right go right there i want to put them closer together um just so that way i can look at them all but that's cool thing with mero so a past episode would probably so with the past episode just be the same as the episode airs except like after it initially airs yes but that's another question is i do i create the same type of post and repost it or do i like scroll the death and like retweet the same post so um i think there there are a few different approaches there um so the thing that i've actually found um works fairly well so i use a tool called hype fury that allows me to set um like recurrent posts and like what they say are like evergreen tweets um and it'll like periodically retweet those for me so you could totally use a tool like that to just like and then you can even say like at the end of the day go back and get rid of all of my retweets so that if somebody just like comes to my profile and scrolls through like it won't just be a bunch of crap retweeted um so that way it deletes your retweet so it like yeah it un-retweets it and so like the idea for the retweet is really just get it live again in people's feeds for like a day and then at the end of the day just go back and undo that and then do it again later right and so what is that called again uh so it's called hype fury um um fury pure i will it's i'm not the best at spelling no one looks at my like i'll i'll drop it in the uh in the private chat there i don't have uh um yeah and so they can um you know do all sorts of like magic with that and um so that's a good way to kind of automate that part out and so really after you um create the initial tweet you can add it to your list of um just like evergreen tweets or whatever and then so periodically it'll just like put it in um and you can set like schedules for how often you want that stuff to happen um can also it as you go up through the tiers you can like also integrate instagram and link din um but i know like the link din version is more than i want to pay for it so i i don't do that part of it um but uh yeah something to think about and especially if you can uh expense it to work i recommend that because then you could actually probably set it up for everything but um i'm just re like going back here and and i'm like oh yeah you guys aren't technically go workers and that is fantastic because you both are good humans they both work on microsoft oh very cool yeah that is cool i didn't even think of that because i think you guys it is just such a giant company and beads like all right awesome glad you guys connected i need to concentrate um all right so past that's an option um or just um schedule can schedule at the sode do you pliket duplicate of at the sode hairs right that's another way i could do it um yeah absolutely and you know one thing to to possibly consider here too is just maybe the cadence that you want to do that right like so often do you want to share old episodes um so that's i think another thing is oh shit this is why it's so complicated for me so episode heirs i also have to do hype or i mean do i need to do hype stuff um well so what do you what do you normally do in terms of hype stuff what i normally do or back in the day when i had a real job and paid somebody to do this stuff because it doesn't like it clicks for me for teach shuntek it does not click for me for doing podcast and stuff like it's but like creating um audio grams so that way people post them and get excited um and going back a step i'm like cool i can create the audio gram i just don't know what to cut i don't know what's going to be an important clip um and then like then doing like a different graphic like a text graphic of them um like a quote or something like that so what do i do for that one how do i figure out that quote i can create it i just don't know what to do like how to get there and that is what i mean by hypes okay yeah that that makes sense um so uh you said you used de-script right i do okay um and so do you record the uh video and audio for your podcast okay um so i'll let you in a little secret that actually uh low-bout told me about editing and like finding the highlights he said instead of like listening to it or like looking at the words and like you know de-script as the um transcript right he said just like scroll through and watch the faces and when faces light up that's a highlight like um so you could see it on people's faces like when they get excited about something or you know something is interesting um you can just like kind of do a quick scroll through and say like oh this was kind of like a high energy moment and like that's a good opportunity for a highlight clip um so that might be helpful and this part i'm not gonna be terribly useful on other than that one tip because um i don't do that yeah and on this one and i think that's a really good call out and i want to write it out i'm trying to think it through a little bit uh of when there's shitty topics on like will what will that expression be in the fact that like if we're talking about generational trauma if we're talking about um you know that that does make it a little harder like where i really like that hack though that's why i'm like i think it's good and i think you know instead of looking for maybe the eyes light up um because that would not quite apply um but you can definitely see um emotional responses right and those emotional responses are a good place to um you know cut the clip or whatever um but i would even say like for this part of it we don't necessarily need to like model all of that out right again this can go on forever as much as we want it really good um um i'm going to do so those are announcements which this is looking good but then i'm actually gonna do just gonna copy both of these so it makes my life easier hypes what would i call hype ones like i like how you put like a very logical like this is an archive this is an interactive what would i hype be would that be an an an announcement to um so i would say uh we could call it a couple different things um potentially like an artifact um right like so something that is shareable like a a concrete um representation of something you know even like a because you know the thing like and they're actually different types so i would even like separate those those out right so there are audiograms there are you know yeah video clips there are um kind of static images right um and so uh yeah i think probably the classifier i'd put it would be like just artifacts or um that's the only word i could think of which maybe not even the best one but it's the one so um you can always rename it now i kind of like artifacts because it um makes me feel like Indiana Jones right and that's and you could you could do an entire Indiana Jones themed workflow to where you rename like you name all of the steps like something that makes you think of Indiana Jones and then the whole workflow is more fun too um so that's the other thing that i the other trick that i somehow used to like make myself do stuff yes and i like that because it's like the audiograms the text quote um quote yeah whatever and so for those and this is also the other thing is like how much like we're putting like what i need to put into them but not like the necessarily how to create them but i am going to do this really quick so i don't forget and these grids use visual cues facial expressions to create you find right audiogram right cool and so one way to actually kind of streamline this too is once you find you know you can start by doing the audiogram because if you can quickly scan to get that um then you can just make a text quote of that audiogram um to kind of streamline it and then would you reshare the same information though or did it would it because they're hype ones these this is literally what i get stuck on is oh i like that idea but is that good enough so if it's done it's good enough um to share and you can always modify the process later um but i'm a big believer in just making it as easy as possible from the get go and then optimizing later so the answer is i have no idea if it'll work um but i would start there and then see how they perform if you start to see things like go down and go well maybe people don't aren't all that interested but what i found is that typically first of all like twitter doesn't show everybody everything anyway and so you could share the same thing like five times and nobody's going to see it five times most likely um they might see it once and so that's that's kind of the uh the trick there um but also people are attracted like by different things so they may see both of them um but based on what they're more interested in they may you know actually like engage with the audiogram or they might engage with the text quote um whereas they you know probably wouldn't necessarily engage with both because people are attractive to kind of different cues right and so being able to um just give people options to like it's tough like with social media and trying to like get people to do things like in that feed it's such a crapshoot anyway um i think that's another great question to you and uh Ben like you're going to be stuck in the back of my head about accessibility for the rest of my life thanks but no thanks um i will say it like that um is it open captions that are burned in to the video because i'm wondering if descript does that so that way you can post with okay so i don't know if descript does open captions but it's like to be able to read it at the same time right um yeah and that's something that is uh good to figure out and unfortunately i don't know the answer to that i that's okay we're gonna put um we can go back and fix that later you can export closed but do you know if it can do open for um uh for audiograms because i think it has an audiogram export option okay anyway gotta keep going gotta keep going all right so audiogram is also going to have the graphic uh and then it's gonna have oh yeah that was been fine it will have the title it will have um um audio that and i don't know if it does open captions but i can look into it i think folks may use cap cap cut all right i'll just put it or look into cap okay and this is the other thing is like right now i'm like y'all i don't have a real job yet so i'm buying shit and that's a big thing because when i first launched the podcast i had a lot of automation which did make it easier but very expensive very very very it adds up so quickly um yeah and so that's why i say um just do what you can and don't worry about doing everything like especially on a limited budget um because you know yet all of that stuff can be added later um and you know like keep in mind like these can definitely like like first of all you know a lot of this is shared information like so you know if we look at kind of how different like you know that the title shared and everything um and yeah like the automation triggers are a great way to like um you know so as things happen you can just kind of pass that information down the line right um and so oh that's cool yeah like uh jay you uh there's so many things i want you on the show for so you first we got to get you on the show and then you can be requested as a repeat person too right so i do it once it's the uh that's the trick um um but yeah so that's that's cool okay uh yeah and it's showing like it's repeat content repeat content um and like the graphics for episode airs the audiogram and then you know i'm going to say that the text quote has some sort of um caption there as well yeah so this one can those all be like the same graphic or the same template at least um because if you have a template um which if you if you don't i would highly recommend like spending a little bit of time to develop that template where you can just drop down what you need um luckily those yes i do have those okay i figured as much it's just um i don't know why they're so time consuming for me but they are this is also a big reason like i've been slacking on like teach gen tech stuff too because i'm just like there's so many steps did i forget a step so i'll also be doing this for that too this this mural board is gonna go on forever uh and that's that's kind of the great part about it is like just starting it you can always add to it right and you can keep adding levels of detail um and as you do that you start to see like oh well this is shared here and there um because then you can kind of start like rearranging things and then you say like oh well actually i only need to like do this one thing and then that unlocks the data that i need for like these next four things and then maybe i can automate some of those or all of them right um and so you'll be able to kind of do things in different orders as you realize that it's you know we we typically think of things linearly um but when designing workflows you'll you'll start to see like where there's a lot of repeat work in in various steps right and so if you can extract that repeat work out into like a preliminary step and then just share it between the rest of the tasks all those other tasks get smaller and therefore easy to easier to manage um and that that's why i think this is just such a valuable exercise in terms of like figuring out like what pieces go where um and so you know we can kind of see that like all of this data for this is pretty much um something we can capture right in terms of um so like you know most of it's shared and i think the only things that like necessarily require new work um are you know putting the the information into the graphic for each one right and so like those will be slightly different uh yeah right but almost well let me delete this one because i think the graphic i'm gonna put these ones up here i think the graphic for like episode errors is going to be the same graphic for like the audiogram okay so i can put it there but it's not the same graphic as the text quote because i'm not going to be able to fit it all on there if it is you know right so yeah graphic we got title title is the same for everybody okay and i will color code these later so they're easier to read and then description would only go into episode errors because that's going to be longer i can give you to these and all of this stuff it's all but on its by itself so okay so now i think we can actually step out of the workflow for a minute and if you remember last time we were talking about like identifying the nouns that we care about right yeah um and so i think the most important noun here is episode right and so like that episode then contains the title you know the description uh the date and time of airing let's see and then so we have two graphics so there's the like announcement graphic and the uh text quote graphic yeah so so and the audiogram and and i think this is something that um i definitely would want to do more on a another episode because it's like at least in my head where i think this would be really hopeful is we're taking it and so we're looking at the data model and the workflow we're creating the nouns but just like when i'm like hey what do we want to make it's going to be cool i don't know what to make and then like a program like you know do i want to make a web app do i like i don't know where to start for what the naming convention should be and all the things i should name and actually translating that to a program so i'm just going to Leo or anybody else that one day when Leo and i are done with this want to create something that can like show people this or talk me through that all figured out to you but being able to like you know go from step a to z even though they're two different projects so i mean the the cool thing about this so actually um and i will say that for the nouns really episode was the noun um all of that other stuff is kind of under episode so like and when i say nouns a lot of times this is something that will be a table in a database um or or that's kind of the easiest way to think about it right um and then so all of those will be columns within that database um potentially and so when you start looking at these and you say okay well if i have a database that has this information then i can generate all of the artifacts that i need from that information right and so you know kind of just starting out by then like okay when i create an episode these are the things i need to fill out and then it's probably just a matter of like copying and pasting into tweets for now um but then later you can be like oh i can actually just automate you know this step of the process to post these tweets um and ideally what would happen is you'd be able to record the information or you know record the episode put in this information and then it would automatically do the rest of it because these these are really the most important pieces of the workflow right the rest of it's just kind of like breaking it up into various pieces and putting it out to different destinations and that's really um like what what an app is about right or a program except typically when we think of that we think of like a web app it's displaying all this information like somewhere in our own web app whereas this workflow we're displaying bits and pieces of information on twitter or on instagram or on like dinner wherever and so that's why it's such a good idea to kind of get this handle unlike what are the most important pieces of things i've got because once i get that data i can do all sorts of things with it and i can even like transform it into various um uh you know different representations of that data um but the data is what is actually needed because then you start thinking okay well where do i get that data can i get any of that data automatically um and so you you create the database table and maybe you start off by just putting it in manually but then you realize oh actually when i post this episode uh or you know when stream yard saves this episode or whatever right that's a we i can save that to a specific location and then pre-populate all this information or at least like some section of it right um and so you can start getting a little bit of this information like pieces at a time automatic and so all of that then becomes a bigger app because you've broken it down into like small pieces and say okay I need this this and this where do I get those and you know it's easiest to just start off manually like just give yourself a place to start off manually and so like um air table or notion great uh i love notion i do too and i'm i'm still learning it um but like i'm a Cub Scout leader for my sons Cub Scout then this this year and so one of the first things i did is i created a notion dashboard to like keep track of like what i need to do um yeah um because i'm not got yet but um but yeah like just being able to have like a representation of this data and just being able to see like oh i need this and i can fill all this in and then like oh for this next step i just have to copy and paste all of this that makes it so much easier um and like yeah just just going through the process i think is so helpful in seeing that because again then you start being able to reorganize you start being able to optimize various workflows um and you start to see like where your pain points are and like oh well like 90 percent of this is okay but this one piece is a real pain in the ass um like okay well how can i break that down further how can i fix that do i need that piece maybe i don't maybe i can just scrap it and say it's not worth the effort right for for what we're getting and and that's really where the the good optimizations can come in and i'm totally digging this and it was really really helpful like a just being able to go okay Jen stopping so ADHD and like refocus uh in the fact that this is a big problem that i have when trying to get this stuff done without having like a list written out because i'm like oh honey that's over there and i don't mean that as like a i hate the term when people are like oh doory i'm like no it's just naturally i'm like oh but this needs to get done too and you know there's a million things that need to be done and then i think about this like you can branch off for a while you can follow the the rabbit hole right and go like oh well this actually leads here here and here but then you can go oh actually i just need to come back to here i don't need to focus on that right now but when i do need to focus it i've already got the connection started so i can come back in and then like work on that exactly so i do find it really helpful to kind of because it it's just builds on itself right and so as you start modeling it out um you kind of get this more complex thing over time that allows you to more easily come back to where you were before um and you know so you have that diagram and then you have the database and like so once you have that like and you start putting things in it all starts coming together because that part becomes easier and then you're like oh well now i have extra time that i can spend on this part of it and moment do i want to automate this yes no i don't know um and so not gonna lie uh this is uh i'm gonna be sending you the link to like schedule your next episode you know because i think something that in uh labao is like the so many quotes from labao uh uh something that he said that really stuck with me is like when people um and i'm totally paraphrasing this of like when people are like hey you're here but go over to that island and like we can all logically be like okay cool i need to get to that island but how do we go from a to be like like you're okay you're telling me how but is this i don't you're saying words but i don't get it and i think that is something that i'm like okay cool like you've shown me how to do this it makes enough sense that i i feel like i can work through my diagrams for everything but then the database i'm like i lie get it but i don't get it so it sounds like next time we need to be working on the database yes yes and liao is good at this stuff definitely i agree and uh homey uh liao definitely needs to come back this is his i'm super i'm kind of glad when i'm kind of surprised that nobody showed up last week for us so because it was not as organized it was just like a bunch of but it was a lot of theory that's set up for today which i'm very very grateful for yeah and you know theory is good and it's but honestly like just going through the process i'm always torn of like do i do theory first or practice first because it doesn't really matter because like big big kind of like feed into each other um and so you know we can go through like the process of just doing it and then talk about the theory and why all of it works i don't actually need the theory but but it does get you to some places like earlier sometimes um and that that's something i always like go back and forth on because like i'm really like interested in the theory because it's like oh yeah this is why all of this works because i've been doing this for a long time but in reality you don't actually need to know a lot of like yeah it's helpful kind maybe it's interesting i don't know but i find it interesting interesting interesting i can't talk in third-resting there we go and once again we are thank you for joining today i know you and i both have meetings at the top of the hour so i'm gonna end the broadcast and thank you all for joining please also tweet us like if you want to see shows on like specific people tag them and tag me to have them on teach gen tech tag leo too so you know we can convince them well i don't want to say i will bully them on to the show that's mean gen but not aggressively convince them because it'll be so much fun and beneficial for all involved yes yeah what he's what he's all right thank you all bye
I have episodes backlogged that all I have to do is upload them but I'm like so overwhelmed and stuck that I haven't like no touchy touchy and it just now it's so big of a monster that I'm like I know I need to do it I don't know where to start and this is I would say kind of like a start on data modeling yeah it's kind of outlining the workflow and I think that that's really great and when it comes to actually like where to start the modeling process because again you can run into the same issue right I can we could just start at the beginning but one of the things that I like to do I like to start with two questions so first of all what is the is there a place that you tend to forget to do a step because I know the ADHD that's something that this is how I pretty much function every time as soon as I forget to do do do something I can pretty much guarantee I'm going to forget to do it again because ADHD and so I work a way to automate that step as much as possible so I can't forget so either it's an automation of the step itself or it's an automated alert that if I forget the step it'll let me know and not let me continue so that's kind of the one approach and then the the second place that I like to start is any place that is just like time consuming is there is there a bottleneck in the process somewhere because again kind of from the ADHD perspective right it's like knowing that there's something time consuming it doesn't have to be hard but it's just kind of painful in that sense right it just takes up so much time and so it stops from doing it and so that's where I like to start in the process and just say like hey where are the biggest pain points and you know when it comes to building products as well this is a good way to design products instead of focusing on like what you think the world looks like start with like the problem where is the problem and then kind of you know move out from there so I find this a helpful process so if you've got a place that that fits either of those I think that would be a good place to start all right and that being said like um bring me for that explanation because I think that does make a lot of sense I think for myself is I'm stuck on social I'm like stuck at the end um because I know I need to plan stuff from the beginning but I'm like oh shit like this I need like an audiogram or graphics or um you know where am I uploading am I doing something with patreon and my and these are all thoughts that I'm like it's terrifying because I've realized if I don't do social media no one's going to find out about the podcast it's not it's a it's definitely a niche it is not teach shentech it's a lot easier to get traction yeah and that's um so that's a good point so we can start with social media then because I think that's good so the first thing I would do is I would break that down into what social media platforms you care about that way you know social media is kind of a broad term um so if we break that out into the the various platforms that you use that will probably be like a good bit easier and y'all uh I like it Jay you just don't do any social I don't blame you um I definitely don't blame you it's so this was the beginning of me trying to figure out social because I have four projects and so we're just gonna skip the other ones because the only one that I'm mostly doing for social is teach shentech because people won't show up and I'm like I want people to show up this is good content to learn so for the podcast which is called shit you don't want to talk about so if you see the word shit that is why it's not shit it is actually really good um but it's twitter linkedin instagram and tectalk okay so um you know that kind of tells me that we we probably need like four different flows right and so you know in kind of breaking this out I like to get it down to you know as simple as possible right like just a very simple workflow because then we can come back and we can actually like um make composite workflows that are built up of the um workflows that you kind of broken apart right um so yeah let's start let's just start with twitter um we don't even need to worry about the rest of it so we'll just start with twitter um so what kind of content do you have to push out to twitter ee okay uh now i'm just like totally frozen i would say some of the content is the same across platforms um so like episode announcements and episode um live there we go that's what i'll call it and then I have you know past episodes uh pauses like um pauses to contribute to or important hot topics and do hot topic just because hot topic i really want to start it belt uh yeah i know that's why i was just thinking about it so the young me that always wanted to look like a really cool email punk goth kid it never happened but i finally got the purple hair i was like the purple hair at rocks and it like matches the whole like twitch stream which i think is fantastic like it's very color coordinated thank you thank you and i actually used to have like a ton of facial piercings and worked at sponsors for a number of years so um yeah no i'm right there with you like i i was right there and all of that so uh but yeah i think it is too words to go back to the original um yes and thank you Ben for commenting my hair um it is also something that i'm pretty sure and Ben this is before i knew you so i'm like i think it was Ben but i'm not 100% sure that he was posting stuff in um one of the discord and i was like trying to model my stuff like kept like seen other people's graphics i'm not sure it was two and a half months ago that was a long time ago i don't remember all right what else do i need to post on twitter oh um something i'm supposed to be posting there too and not is uh when's when red miss day twitter spaces putter space how's it going Ben um yeah uh so okay so i see a couple different things um popping out right and so this is why it's always helpful to like go through this process because now i see so we've got kind of the um announcements right and so there's something happening at a specific time um and so you know you want to be able to alert people that it's live um and then there's kind of the like discussion category right um so that's like the hot topic uh causes what do we want to get into um so that that's kind of an interactive thing um and then like past episodes um i would say is kind of uh let's see i guess we can call it like archive right and so that that's kind of a just something we can kind of like reach back and pull things out from from the past to kind of get people interested into what's going on right um and so kind of looking at this here um so you know if we start breaking it down and kind of just start thinking about what we might want to do um for the announcements because i think that's probably the easiest right um um and uh so you know we've kind of got the um event name right um we could probably say like uh event i'm gonna say category that may not be the best word but you know kind of in terms of like so you've got like the four different projects right um so you probably want to categorize that oh um project maybe project might be better um just uh some way to campaign there we go yeah it's the it's the marketing term for it yes that's an excellent one yeah um okay i know i'm totally making a slowdown because i'm trying to organize this to where i can like do it again no no it's cool and i think that is a really handy thing to do um and i do that pretty much with everything i do like the first time i do something i tried to go through it slower to make it more repeatable in the future because then it's more likely that i'll do it again in the future again ADHD got to play tricks so with ourselves right like we've got to make it as easy as possible on our future selves yes yes okay so you were saying for announcements it's like um um i could do this you need me so it's at least for this announcement it would be campaign uh i really so campaigned to me is saying yeah what what uh like project it is like you said but i do think that i need to start putting tags like on hey this is this topic so i probably separate that out into something else so that that's that was actually the next thing on my uh list that i was just thinking about um because the tags could actually be shared between campaigns right yeah because there is a lot of overlap in in the the different things so i think tags are important so but campaigns so would i put campaign on like each of them or that's like a hierarchy like up here kind of thing like all of them needs to be in the hands um yeah i would say that that's probably shared between all of them okay and so uh that's are also shared right um yeah because like trying to figure out hashtags is interesting just to say the least yes i just i'm pretty curious um because of that it's like i don't know it to you so i'm just not gonna use any or i'll create my own and then nobody will use it except for me and that's fine too uh java script and js get retweeted by bots i know and it's amazing because it does get more visibility i know although i do feel really bad if i use like hundred devs because i'm like i'm not doing that program i shouldn't use that the hashtag but it gets retweeted but it's also helpful for people in the hundred devs community right and that's kind of the thing so if it's something that they're interested in learning um i actually love the hundred devs community i've had a lot of coffee chats with people from there and i think it's a fantastic group but um that that's that's on the side there okay so an episode would have an episode uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh well where do i put um like episodes content like i should know the episode name and everything by this point so i would be using like episode title and one liner okay so we've got like a title and a description which i think and yeah like i title is probably i said kind of like event name right but yeah title is um but yeah the description is handy um and then you know the i think the the date of it is probably helpful for people to show up maybe well these ones um when the episodes are live i mean that they go live that day it's oh god i see these names they are like they come they're supposed to come out on Wednesdays cool um so okay that that makes sense um and so you know i was thinking of like the the event is live not like yeah you know but anyway it's it's it's about the same right it's actually um episode heirs episode there we go um and then so yeah that um and then i feel like i can make these smaller to also work better and then because these would also need to go to this one and this one oh i definitely need to like move stuff around um this one would also have date because it's a twitter space right by great i do mean great in time i feel like they can be lumped together that sounds good um okay so and oh sorry i just for remembered one that i'm really bad at and um tagging people we talked about this and if we want to create something that can tag people i would i would love that but i need to tag all the humans so we can absolutely create something that does that that's going to be a one day thing i like that we're starting to have like repeat repeat i almost said repeat customers repeat guests uh bends coming on once a month to talk about accessibility and excellent jay will be on at some point he has a talk tomorrow and just raised money yesterday nice i was watching that live stream for a bit all right so we uh so yeah let's see um is there anything else you like to include in those in those two specifically um oh yes uh graphic oh great oh dope if i can make it i totally will i really like watching other people's live streams because even like especially people i know it's like it's kind of like what what is it called again the um buddy system not buddy system body doubling yeah hotty doubling and it's very calming and i learn so much so much so true um but oh you're not doing a stream you're doing it while you're watching okay that's fair you do cool things we'll use dream too or first part of doubling here what are we going all right so we have episode airs we need the title description and graphic okay and Wednesdays uh is title description date and time and tag all the humans so for the the twitter space um in terms of tagging humans are they people who have been there before are they people that you expect to be there where are we getting the humans um the humans are magical creatures that just showed up enough that i started tagging them or they requested to be tagged all right i have a very ad hoc list of people that i try to uh like tag across all of them like i i i've had to create i think three posts yesterday and three posts today just to try to get everybody tagged for tomorrow's twitter space and um but i mean like the Wednesday twitter space is technically like uh uh my social media thing but the podcast definitely needs to start doing it too because it's where my two lives overlap right okay well that's something to think about because we can um you know think about good ways to do that because there are limits on kind of how many people you can tag and like but if we have the idea of tagging people i think um that that would be useful right and so human tags as opposed to topic tags yeah oh that's a great way of uh saying that it's the problem like words just start overlapping and you're like okay well now i'm using the same word for like multiple things and that just that gets tricky um i'm gonna pause this really quick yes and say jay i watched owls um stream last night and i didn't want to get booted so i was like yo can i uh like talk about other people so i totally talked about you and just tagged your twitter space uh or your twitter and you do cool things so everybody should like basically anybody that's like hanging out with us you should just go follow them so if y'all want to just like drop your twitter's do it because everybody's really does cool things here so everyone should be friends it's just where i'm at all right go with you so uh these are created from uh requests tag requests yeah like people asking to be on it to be tagged right so i was looking i was looking at blushing's question that i don't i don't know the answer to that um wait the links looks like it showed up um well i think just anybody who drops links in the chat are not getting deleted by about if they don't subscribe or maybe they do subscribe i don't know i'm super new to twitch so i'm just trying to like oh me too i understand it Ben might know this one or Jay or i'm just trying to think uh i i honestly have reached out to you Ben so many times about um twitch that that's just my go-to person but i probably other people know too i was gonna say blushing's probably one of the more experienced twitch streamers here too so it might be a setting or something i don't know or perhaps it just works um but you should totally go follow uh blushing i will totally uh vouch for for everything she does there blushing we're gonna be friends it's gonna happen and i will follow you after this maybe let's see how i i'm i'm getting confused so i'm not going to i'm working on focusing today because we have to stop at the end of the hour all right um so tag requests that's how i get tagged all the humans is the request and i so just out of to know that i have to create something here i'm just gonna put um need to create list process to do the things of tagging yeah that's that's good um the nice thing is like we can just like these chains can go on forever and we can kind of like do it so um you know it's okay to just like stop and be like that's good enough for now um yeah and uh okay cool so let's actually go down to the bottom and see what we've got for these two right all right go right there i want to put them closer together um just so that way i can look at them all but that's cool thing with mero so a past episode would probably so with the past episode just be the same as the episode airs except like after it initially airs yes but that's another question is i do i create the same type of post and repost it or do i like scroll the death and like retweet the same post so um i think there there are a few different approaches there um so the thing that i've actually found um works fairly well so i use a tool called hype fury that allows me to set um like recurrent posts and like what they say are like evergreen tweets um and it'll like periodically retweet those for me so you could totally use a tool like that to just like and then you can even say like at the end of the day go back and get rid of all of my retweets so that if somebody just like comes to my profile and scrolls through like it won't just be a bunch of crap retweeted um so that way it deletes your retweet so it like yeah it un-retweets it and so like the idea for the retweet is really just get it live again in people's feeds for like a day and then at the end of the day just go back and undo that and then do it again later right and so what is that called again uh so it's called hype fury um um fury pure i will it's i'm not the best at spelling no one looks at my like i'll i'll drop it in the uh in the private chat there i don't have uh um yeah and so they can um you know do all sorts of like magic with that and um so that's a good way to kind of automate that part out and so really after you um create the initial tweet you can add it to your list of um just like evergreen tweets or whatever and then so periodically it'll just like put it in um and you can set like schedules for how often you want that stuff to happen um can also it as you go up through the tiers you can like also integrate instagram and link din um but i know like the link din version is more than i want to pay for it so i i don't do that part of it um but uh yeah something to think about and especially if you can uh expense it to work i recommend that because then you could actually probably set it up for everything but um i'm just re like going back here and and i'm like oh yeah you guys aren't technically go workers and that is fantastic because you both are good humans they both work on microsoft oh very cool yeah that is cool i didn't even think of that because i think you guys it is just such a giant company and beads like all right awesome glad you guys connected i need to concentrate um all right so past that's an option um or just um schedule can schedule at the sode do you pliket duplicate of at the sode hairs right that's another way i could do it um yeah absolutely and you know one thing to to possibly consider here too is just maybe the cadence that you want to do that right like so often do you want to share old episodes um so that's i think another thing is oh shit this is why it's so complicated for me so episode heirs i also have to do hype or i mean do i need to do hype stuff um well so what do you what do you normally do in terms of hype stuff what i normally do or back in the day when i had a real job and paid somebody to do this stuff because it doesn't like it clicks for me for teach shuntek it does not click for me for doing podcast and stuff like it's but like creating um audio grams so that way people post them and get excited um and going back a step i'm like cool i can create the audio gram i just don't know what to cut i don't know what's going to be an important clip um and then like then doing like a different graphic like a text graphic of them um like a quote or something like that so what do i do for that one how do i figure out that quote i can create it i just don't know what to do like how to get there and that is what i mean by hypes okay yeah that that makes sense um so uh you said you used de-script right i do okay um and so do you record the uh video and audio for your podcast okay um so i'll let you in a little secret that actually uh low-bout told me about editing and like finding the highlights he said instead of like listening to it or like looking at the words and like you know de-script as the um transcript right he said just like scroll through and watch the faces and when faces light up that's a highlight like um so you could see it on people's faces like when they get excited about something or you know something is interesting um you can just like kind of do a quick scroll through and say like oh this was kind of like a high energy moment and like that's a good opportunity for a highlight clip um so that might be helpful and this part i'm not gonna be terribly useful on other than that one tip because um i don't do that yeah and on this one and i think that's a really good call out and i want to write it out i'm trying to think it through a little bit uh of when there's shitty topics on like will what will that expression be in the fact that like if we're talking about generational trauma if we're talking about um you know that that does make it a little harder like where i really like that hack though that's why i'm like i think it's good and i think you know instead of looking for maybe the eyes light up um because that would not quite apply um but you can definitely see um emotional responses right and those emotional responses are a good place to um you know cut the clip or whatever um but i would even say like for this part of it we don't necessarily need to like model all of that out right again this can go on forever as much as we want it really good um um i'm going to do so those are announcements which this is looking good but then i'm actually gonna do just gonna copy both of these so it makes my life easier hypes what would i call hype ones like i like how you put like a very logical like this is an archive this is an interactive what would i hype be would that be an an an announcement to um so i would say uh we could call it a couple different things um potentially like an artifact um right like so something that is shareable like a a concrete um representation of something you know even like a because you know the thing like and they're actually different types so i would even like separate those those out right so there are audiograms there are you know yeah video clips there are um kind of static images right um and so uh yeah i think probably the classifier i'd put it would be like just artifacts or um that's the only word i could think of which maybe not even the best one but it's the one so um you can always rename it now i kind of like artifacts because it um makes me feel like Indiana Jones right and that's and you could you could do an entire Indiana Jones themed workflow to where you rename like you name all of the steps like something that makes you think of Indiana Jones and then the whole workflow is more fun too um so that's the other thing that i the other trick that i somehow used to like make myself do stuff yes and i like that because it's like the audiograms the text quote um quote yeah whatever and so for those and this is also the other thing is like how much like we're putting like what i need to put into them but not like the necessarily how to create them but i am going to do this really quick so i don't forget and these grids use visual cues facial expressions to create you find right audiogram right cool and so one way to actually kind of streamline this too is once you find you know you can start by doing the audiogram because if you can quickly scan to get that um then you can just make a text quote of that audiogram um to kind of streamline it and then would you reshare the same information though or did it would it because they're hype ones these this is literally what i get stuck on is oh i like that idea but is that good enough so if it's done it's good enough um to share and you can always modify the process later um but i'm a big believer in just making it as easy as possible from the get go and then optimizing later so the answer is i have no idea if it'll work um but i would start there and then see how they perform if you start to see things like go down and go well maybe people don't aren't all that interested but what i found is that typically first of all like twitter doesn't show everybody everything anyway and so you could share the same thing like five times and nobody's going to see it five times most likely um they might see it once and so that's that's kind of the uh the trick there um but also people are attracted like by different things so they may see both of them um but based on what they're more interested in they may you know actually like engage with the audiogram or they might engage with the text quote um whereas they you know probably wouldn't necessarily engage with both because people are attractive to kind of different cues right and so being able to um just give people options to like it's tough like with social media and trying to like get people to do things like in that feed it's such a crapshoot anyway um i think that's another great question to you and uh Ben like you're going to be stuck in the back of my head about accessibility for the rest of my life thanks but no thanks um i will say it like that um is it open captions that are burned in to the video because i'm wondering if descript does that so that way you can post with okay so i don't know if descript does open captions but it's like to be able to read it at the same time right um yeah and that's something that is uh good to figure out and unfortunately i don't know the answer to that i that's okay we're gonna put um we can go back and fix that later you can export closed but do you know if it can do open for um uh for audiograms because i think it has an audiogram export option okay anyway gotta keep going gotta keep going all right so audiogram is also going to have the graphic uh and then it's gonna have oh yeah that was been fine it will have the title it will have um um audio that and i don't know if it does open captions but i can look into it i think folks may use cap cap cut all right i'll just put it or look into cap okay and this is the other thing is like right now i'm like y'all i don't have a real job yet so i'm buying shit and that's a big thing because when i first launched the podcast i had a lot of automation which did make it easier but very expensive very very very it adds up so quickly um yeah and so that's why i say um just do what you can and don't worry about doing everything like especially on a limited budget um because you know yet all of that stuff can be added later um and you know like keep in mind like these can definitely like like first of all you know a lot of this is shared information like so you know if we look at kind of how different like you know that the title shared and everything um and yeah like the automation triggers are a great way to like um you know so as things happen you can just kind of pass that information down the line right um and so oh that's cool yeah like uh jay you uh there's so many things i want you on the show for so you first we got to get you on the show and then you can be requested as a repeat person too right so i do it once it's the uh that's the trick um um but yeah so that's that's cool okay uh yeah and it's showing like it's repeat content repeat content um and like the graphics for episode airs the audiogram and then you know i'm going to say that the text quote has some sort of um caption there as well yeah so this one can those all be like the same graphic or the same template at least um because if you have a template um which if you if you don't i would highly recommend like spending a little bit of time to develop that template where you can just drop down what you need um luckily those yes i do have those okay i figured as much it's just um i don't know why they're so time consuming for me but they are this is also a big reason like i've been slacking on like teach gen tech stuff too because i'm just like there's so many steps did i forget a step so i'll also be doing this for that too this this mural board is gonna go on forever uh and that's that's kind of the great part about it is like just starting it you can always add to it right and you can keep adding levels of detail um and as you do that you start to see like oh well this is shared here and there um because then you can kind of start like rearranging things and then you say like oh well actually i only need to like do this one thing and then that unlocks the data that i need for like these next four things and then maybe i can automate some of those or all of them right um and so you'll be able to kind of do things in different orders as you realize that it's you know we we typically think of things linearly um but when designing workflows you'll you'll start to see like where there's a lot of repeat work in in various steps right and so if you can extract that repeat work out into like a preliminary step and then just share it between the rest of the tasks all those other tasks get smaller and therefore easy to easier to manage um and that that's why i think this is just such a valuable exercise in terms of like figuring out like what pieces go where um and so you know we can kind of see that like all of this data for this is pretty much um something we can capture right in terms of um so like you know most of it's shared and i think the only things that like necessarily require new work um are you know putting the the information into the graphic for each one right and so like those will be slightly different uh yeah right but almost well let me delete this one because i think the graphic i'm gonna put these ones up here i think the graphic for like episode errors is going to be the same graphic for like the audiogram okay so i can put it there but it's not the same graphic as the text quote because i'm not going to be able to fit it all on there if it is you know right so yeah graphic we got title title is the same for everybody okay and i will color code these later so they're easier to read and then description would only go into episode errors because that's going to be longer i can give you to these and all of this stuff it's all but on its by itself so okay so now i think we can actually step out of the workflow for a minute and if you remember last time we were talking about like identifying the nouns that we care about right yeah um and so i think the most important noun here is episode right and so like that episode then contains the title you know the description uh the date and time of airing let's see and then so we have two graphics so there's the like announcement graphic and the uh text quote graphic yeah so so and the audiogram and and i think this is something that um i definitely would want to do more on a another episode because it's like at least in my head where i think this would be really hopeful is we're taking it and so we're looking at the data model and the workflow we're creating the nouns but just like when i'm like hey what do we want to make it's going to be cool i don't know what to make and then like a program like you know do i want to make a web app do i like i don't know where to start for what the naming convention should be and all the things i should name and actually translating that to a program so i'm just going to Leo or anybody else that one day when Leo and i are done with this want to create something that can like show people this or talk me through that all figured out to you but being able to like you know go from step a to z even though they're two different projects so i mean the the cool thing about this so actually um and i will say that for the nouns really episode was the noun um all of that other stuff is kind of under episode so like and when i say nouns a lot of times this is something that will be a table in a database um or or that's kind of the easiest way to think about it right um and then so all of those will be columns within that database um potentially and so when you start looking at these and you say okay well if i have a database that has this information then i can generate all of the artifacts that i need from that information right and so you know kind of just starting out by then like okay when i create an episode these are the things i need to fill out and then it's probably just a matter of like copying and pasting into tweets for now um but then later you can be like oh i can actually just automate you know this step of the process to post these tweets um and ideally what would happen is you'd be able to record the information or you know record the episode put in this information and then it would automatically do the rest of it because these these are really the most important pieces of the workflow right the rest of it's just kind of like breaking it up into various pieces and putting it out to different destinations and that's really um like what what an app is about right or a program except typically when we think of that we think of like a web app it's displaying all this information like somewhere in our own web app whereas this workflow we're displaying bits and pieces of information on twitter or on instagram or on like dinner wherever and so that's why it's such a good idea to kind of get this handle unlike what are the most important pieces of things i've got because once i get that data i can do all sorts of things with it and i can even like transform it into various um uh you know different representations of that data um but the data is what is actually needed because then you start thinking okay well where do i get that data can i get any of that data automatically um and so you you create the database table and maybe you start off by just putting it in manually but then you realize oh actually when i post this episode uh or you know when stream yard saves this episode or whatever right that's a we i can save that to a specific location and then pre-populate all this information or at least like some section of it right um and so you can start getting a little bit of this information like pieces at a time automatic and so all of that then becomes a bigger app because you've broken it down into like small pieces and say okay I need this this and this where do I get those and you know it's easiest to just start off manually like just give yourself a place to start off manually and so like um air table or notion great uh i love notion i do too and i'm i'm still learning it um but like i'm a Cub Scout leader for my sons Cub Scout then this this year and so one of the first things i did is i created a notion dashboard to like keep track of like what i need to do um yeah um because i'm not got yet but um but yeah like just being able to have like a representation of this data and just being able to see like oh i need this and i can fill all this in and then like oh for this next step i just have to copy and paste all of this that makes it so much easier um and like yeah just just going through the process i think is so helpful in seeing that because again then you start being able to reorganize you start being able to optimize various workflows um and you start to see like where your pain points are and like oh well like 90 percent of this is okay but this one piece is a real pain in the ass um like okay well how can i break that down further how can i fix that do i need that piece maybe i don't maybe i can just scrap it and say it's not worth the effort right for for what we're getting and and that's really where the the good optimizations can come in and i'm totally digging this and it was really really helpful like a just being able to go okay Jen stopping so ADHD and like refocus uh in the fact that this is a big problem that i have when trying to get this stuff done without having like a list written out because i'm like oh honey that's over there and i don't mean that as like a i hate the term when people are like oh doory i'm like no it's just naturally i'm like oh but this needs to get done too and you know there's a million things that need to be done and then i think about this like you can branch off for a while you can follow the the rabbit hole right and go like oh well this actually leads here here and here but then you can go oh actually i just need to come back to here i don't need to focus on that right now but when i do need to focus it i've already got the connection started so i can come back in and then like work on that exactly so i do find it really helpful to kind of because it it's just builds on itself right and so as you start modeling it out um you kind of get this more complex thing over time that allows you to more easily come back to where you were before um and you know so you have that diagram and then you have the database and like so once you have that like and you start putting things in it all starts coming together because that part becomes easier and then you're like oh well now i have extra time that i can spend on this part of it and moment do i want to automate this yes no i don't know um and so not gonna lie uh this is uh i'm gonna be sending you the link to like schedule your next episode you know because i think something that in uh labao is like the so many quotes from labao uh uh something that he said that really stuck with me is like when people um and i'm totally paraphrasing this of like when people are like hey you're here but go over to that island and like we can all logically be like okay cool i need to get to that island but how do we go from a to be like like you're okay you're telling me how but is this i don't you're saying words but i don't get it and i think that is something that i'm like okay cool like you've shown me how to do this it makes enough sense that i i feel like i can work through my diagrams for everything but then the database i'm like i lie get it but i don't get it so it sounds like next time we need to be working on the database yes yes and liao is good at this stuff definitely i agree and uh homey uh liao definitely needs to come back this is his i'm super i'm kind of glad when i'm kind of surprised that nobody showed up last week for us so because it was not as organized it was just like a bunch of but it was a lot of theory that's set up for today which i'm very very grateful for yeah and you know theory is good and it's but honestly like just going through the process i'm always torn of like do i do theory first or practice first because it doesn't really matter because like big big kind of like feed into each other um and so you know we can go through like the process of just doing it and then talk about the theory and why all of it works i don't actually need the theory but but it does get you to some places like earlier sometimes um and that that's something i always like go back and forth on because like i'm really like interested in the theory because it's like oh yeah this is why all of this works because i've been doing this for a long time but in reality you don't actually need to know a lot of like yeah it's helpful kind maybe it's interesting i don't know but i find it interesting interesting interesting i can't talk in third-resting there we go and once again we are thank you for joining today i know you and i both have meetings at the top of the hour so i'm gonna end the broadcast and thank you all for joining please also tweet us like if you want to see shows on like specific people tag them and tag me to have them on teach gen tech tag leo too so you know we can convince them well i don't want to say i will bully them on to the show that's mean gen but not aggressively convince them because it'll be so much fun and beneficial for all involved yes yeah what he's what he's all right thank you all bye
