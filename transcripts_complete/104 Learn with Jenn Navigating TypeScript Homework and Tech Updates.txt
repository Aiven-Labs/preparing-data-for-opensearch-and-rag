I'm going to make a little bit of the glue. Hello, little Marie Sau you Hello, beautiful humans Welcome to Teach Nine Tech We're learning tech And today I'm working on some Hope work. And today I'm doing one of the very few tech trainings. I mean, TypeScript I mean, TypeScript. So first off, I am definitely going to see if I could get this new playlist running, even though I should probably go look at YouTube and see what happened there
I mean, TypeScript. So first off, I am definitely going to see if I could get this new playlist running, even though I should probably go look at YouTube and see what happened there While a while back, if you caught errands and my stream, I was working on finding a playlist in music, yet I was told that the music was copyrighted and I'm like, yo, I was given permission from the website and so what is going on? What song was it
While a while back, if you caught errands and my stream, I was working on finding a playlist in music, yet I was told that the music was copyrighted and I'm like, yo, I was given permission from the website and so what is going on? What song was it What song was it? I don't show this to y'all because you know why not? And I got to figure it out so we can work on this together
What song was it? I don't show this to y'all because you know why not? And I got to figure it out so we can work on this together And then once I figure out the music and if I can play this playlist, then I will get started. Do do do do. So I don't think everybody wants me to sing to them. I mean, I could, but you know, that could be weird as well. So just a second
And then once I figure out the music and if I can play this playlist, then I will get started. Do do do do. So I don't think everybody wants me to sing to them. I mean, I could, but you know, that could be weird as well. So just a second So just a second. And then after that, I will be going and working on Looney TypeScript stuff, which I'm excited. I am skipping chapter one. If anyone is curious, I'm definitely skipping chapter one. It has to do with classes
So just a second. And then after that, I will be going and working on Looney TypeScript stuff, which I'm excited. I am skipping chapter one. If anyone is curious, I'm definitely skipping chapter one. It has to do with classes If you caught the last stream with Josh, the author of the book, I am, me and chapters were not, I don't know if we'll ever be friends, but maybe who knows? Okay. And we are all about the dark mode today over on the right. I need to zoom this in anyway. We are looking at my iPad
If you caught the last stream with Josh, the author of the book, I am, me and chapters were not, I don't know if we'll ever be friends, but maybe who knows? Okay. And we are all about the dark mode today over on the right. I need to zoom this in anyway. We are looking at my iPad Very lovely, which I will zoom in when we get to that point, but we are working on this one right now. Oh, yes, homework. I'm getting to it once I figure out why this music was copyrighted. Because it feels weird not listening to music while I'm doing this, falling in love instrumental, no impact
Very lovely, which I will zoom in when we get to that point, but we are working on this one right now. Oh, yes, homework. I'm getting to it once I figure out why this music was copyrighted. Because it feels weird not listening to music while I'm doing this, falling in love instrumental, no impact Okay, then mute the song. Oh, mute all of this song. Yeah, cancel mute only this song. We'll see. Okay. So we're returned to upload. Sure. Next. Publish this because Aaron's probably wondering why I have never published this. Which I don't blame her
Okay, then mute the song. Oh, mute all of this song. Yeah, cancel mute only this song. We'll see. Okay. So we're returned to upload. Sure. Next. Publish this because Aaron's probably wondering why I have never published this. Which I don't blame her Right, I don't get like it's so weird with the copyrights. Let's go to who to is that what I'm using. I should probably look what I'm using for social media. I think it's that one. Sure, let's see. Oh, I'm using buffer. There's so many different social media ones
Right, I don't get like it's so weird with the copyrights. Let's go to who to is that what I'm using. I should probably look what I'm using for social media. I think it's that one. Sure, let's see. Oh, I'm using buffer. There's so many different social media ones Do you ever use social media things? Social media things. That's a very broad term. Posing on multiple social media platforms. Like this. Do you have a preference on which one? Let's paste this before I forget it. This is a a livestream from a while ago
Do you ever use social media things? Social media things. That's a very broad term. Posing on multiple social media platforms. Like this. Do you have a preference on which one? Let's paste this before I forget it. This is a a livestream from a while ago Zero, generally all your stuff for twitches on Twitter. Okay. Oh, that's fair. That's fair. I mostly do. I don't even use Snapchat. I probably should. I want to start using Instagram more because like Instagram and TikTok. Oh, yeah. Totally cool. It's okay if you guys don't reply
Zero, generally all your stuff for twitches on Twitter. Okay. Oh, that's fair. That's fair. I mostly do. I don't even use Snapchat. I probably should. I want to start using Instagram more because like Instagram and TikTok. Oh, yeah. Totally cool. It's okay if you guys don't reply What up, Alex? Even though Alex just as a heads up seeing all of your like user names, I'm going to call you something else at some point. Oh, did you? Oh, that's cool. Yay. Let's see if the AI wants to be my friend. I'm very lazy when it comes to this kind of stuff and just use all AI stuff
What up, Alex? Even though Alex just as a heads up seeing all of your like user names, I'm going to call you something else at some point. Oh, did you? Oh, that's cool. Yay. Let's see if the AI wants to be my friend. I'm very lazy when it comes to this kind of stuff and just use all AI stuff AI, generally, wait, you just came back. Shorten. Oh, what's the AI generator doing? Do you do? Do you? Well, it's thinking. I think it is thinking. Let's do this 20 minute playlist and see what copyrights decide to argue with me. So, I'm hoping I can change
AI, generally, wait, you just came back. Shorten. Oh, what's the AI generator doing? Do you do? Do you? Well, it's thinking. I think it is thinking. Let's do this 20 minute playlist and see what copyrights decide to argue with me. So, I'm hoping I can change Zero, did you work at GoDaddy? That's a very random question. But I wonder if that's how we know each other. Yes, okay. I know. Okay, so did I. So that maybe that's where I don't know. GoDaddy was such so many people that worked there that it's hard to say if like where the overlaps were
Zero, did you work at GoDaddy? That's a very random question. But I wonder if that's how we know each other. Yes, okay. I know. Okay, so did I. So that maybe that's where I don't know. GoDaddy was such so many people that worked there that it's hard to say if like where the overlaps were That and I have a horrible memory. Do you? And right. A tweet about. Do do do do. So in chat, GPT, I don't know if y'all knew this, but you can tell it some custom instructions, which is lovely and creepy all at the same time
That and I have a horrible memory. Do you? And right. A tweet about. Do do do do. So in chat, GPT, I don't know if y'all knew this, but you can tell it some custom instructions, which is lovely and creepy all at the same time So in these custom instructions, I uploaded some of my blogs that I've written so it knows how I talk, which is lovely. Like, it's just so much fun because it writes things in my language. Right. It's crazy how smart it is. I love it. Almost hate it, but it gets me unstuck for a lot of things
So in these custom instructions, I uploaded some of my blogs that I've written so it knows how I talk, which is lovely. Like, it's just so much fun because it writes things in my language. Right. It's crazy how smart it is. I love it. Almost hate it, but it gets me unstuck for a lot of things So it took, it's taking me like five minutes to write this. And instead of like half an hour trying to figure out how to minimize it. You should try to figure out. You're in. Wow, I can spell Aaron. Kissed me. Yes, you were way too long, but that's okay. You're in. What is your
So it took, it's taking me like five minutes to write this. And instead of like half an hour trying to figure out how to minimize it. You should try to figure out. You're in. Wow, I can spell Aaron. Kissed me. Yes, you were way too long, but that's okay. You're in. What is your What is your. You never remember it. You do do. Yes, I'm totally looking at this one off screen. I've learned that lesson. It's not worth it. Do you look at this stuff if you have like DMs open? You definitely could be awkward. Is awkward? Could be awkward? All of the above. Sweet
What is your. You never remember it. You do do. Yes, I'm totally looking at this one off screen. I've learned that lesson. It's not worth it. Do you look at this stuff if you have like DMs open? You definitely could be awkward. Is awkward? Could be awkward? All of the above. Sweet Sweet. I hope you have a cool client. And Alex, if you are still hanging out a bit, what jobs are you looking for? Oh, I can do it. I have glasses on. I'm like, I don't know, arms length away from it. I set really close. I am going to be working on the next project soon. I'm getting these posted
Sweet. I hope you have a cool client. And Alex, if you are still hanging out a bit, what jobs are you looking for? Oh, I can do it. I have glasses on. I'm like, I don't know, arms length away from it. I set really close. I am going to be working on the next project soon. I'm getting these posted But thank you for the call out. They are really small. Oh, okay, that one's really big. And this one, when we get to it, I'll be able to like super, actually, me do this. The tablet needs to move. There. So when we get to that, it will be much bigger. Okay. To be easier to read at that point
But thank you for the call out. They are really small. Oh, okay, that one's really big. And this one, when we get to it, I'll be able to like super, actually, me do this. The tablet needs to move. There. So when we get to that, it will be much bigger. Okay. To be easier to read at that point We get examples now. I don't know if this is good example. Like, I'm a little worried. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Does it look better now? And are you watching on mobile or on desktop? Oh, yeah. This is also just taking off way too much room
We get examples now. I don't know if this is good example. Like, I'm a little worried. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Does it look better now? And are you watching on mobile or on desktop? Oh, yeah. This is also just taking off way too much room I am working on some social posts because I went to go check out. You don't need this one. Um, uh, saw a copyright issue. And then I was like, oh, yeah, I didn't actually get this posted. So I should do that really quick. Use cup and paste this one
I am working on some social posts because I went to go check out. You don't need this one. Um, uh, saw a copyright issue. And then I was like, oh, yeah, I didn't actually get this posted. So I should do that really quick. Use cup and paste this one Lean Den will just be special and have its own special one. There. And I'm using a tool called buffer, even though a minute ago, I couldn't remember what they were called. And they're scheduled. And now I can actually move on. Yay. And we will get this much larger
Lean Den will just be special and have its own special one. There. And I'm using a tool called buffer, even though a minute ago, I couldn't remember what they were called. And they're scheduled. And now I can actually move on. Yay. And we will get this much larger Also, this is one of those like herb screens that I'm like, I'm pretty sure people, like it's so big that I'm like, maybe I shouldn't use this screen as my streaming screen, but you mean bigger? Oh, wrong screen, wrong one, wrong one
Also, this is one of those like herb screens that I'm like, I'm pretty sure people, like it's so big that I'm like, maybe I shouldn't use this screen as my streaming screen, but you mean bigger? Oh, wrong screen, wrong one, wrong one So what we got going on here is I stream with Josh, the author of this book, which I believe I can do a shout out on here. Y'all should definitely go follow Josh of he's been coming on the stream for oh gosh, almost a year now. And yes, uh, oh, ew, oh, that's a hard one pseudo
So what we got going on here is I stream with Josh, the author of this book, which I believe I can do a shout out on here. Y'all should definitely go follow Josh of he's been coming on the stream for oh gosh, almost a year now. And yes, uh, oh, ew, oh, that's a hard one pseudo Like, that's a, that's rough. Because we've been doing this for like two or almost a year, we have seven episodes. And I haven't done the homework. I'm also not always the best at remembering to do the homework
Like, that's a, that's rough. Because we've been doing this for like two or almost a year, we have seven episodes. And I haven't done the homework. I'm also not always the best at remembering to do the homework So if you want to check out the seven episodes, we've found so far a chapter per episode. That is here. And yeah, I'm skipping chapter one. So I have the summary
So if you want to check out the seven episodes, we've found so far a chapter per episode. That is here. And yeah, I'm skipping chapter one. So I have the summary I'm going to go through the summaries of each of these first and then go to the homework after I look through the summary, but I am skipping chapter one. Chapter one has what I hate the most. Hate the most classes. I don't understand them yet. So I'm just skipping chapter one homework
I'm going to go through the summaries of each of these first and then go to the homework after I look through the summary, but I am skipping chapter one. Chapter one has what I hate the most. Hate the most classes. I don't understand them yet. So I'm just skipping chapter one homework Uh, oh, okay. That works, pseudo. Well, if you need anybody to look at, um, yeah, you want to come on the stream and teach me classes, you can't not this stream, but you know, hit me up. I do, oh, I have a new link you can fill out. I just transferred everything over to Monday
Uh, oh, okay. That works, pseudo. Well, if you need anybody to look at, um, yeah, you want to come on the stream and teach me classes, you can't not this stream, but you know, hit me up. I do, oh, I have a new link you can fill out. I just transferred everything over to Mondaycom and actually have it where people can fill out their information and I can get them scheduled. So I can show you guys the form though. That's okay. That's safe. It's very easy. It's just getting all your information and then we'll get something scheduled. So let me put that
com and actually have it where people can fill out their information and I can get them scheduled. So I can show you guys the form though. That's okay. That's safe. It's very easy. It's just getting all your information and then we'll get something scheduled. So let me put that So let me put that. I'll put the form here. Have you, are you in our, uh, OSRG discord? I feel like I never know where anybody is. Just talking to zero about that. Zero and I are friends from Instagram. I mean, nothing. Well, if you decide to join, this is where I put a lot of the updates. Oh, yay
So let me put that. I'll put the form here. Have you, are you in our, uh, OSRG discord? I feel like I never know where anybody is. Just talking to zero about that. Zero and I are friends from Instagram. I mean, nothing. Well, if you decide to join, this is where I put a lot of the updates. Oh, yay Oh, yay. Oh, yay. W.A. Thank you for the follow. If you do decide to join the discord, it's cool because we have it where it's, we also play tabletop games. So it is, it's a fun, right, a guilt to hang out in or discord
Oh, yay. Oh, yay. W.A. Thank you for the follow. If you do decide to join the discord, it's cool because we have it where it's, we also play tabletop games. So it is, it's a fun, right, a guilt to hang out in or discord But it's where I put all of my updates and streams, which I should be copying, pasting in there as well. I'm not yet, but I will. And we also, I have a show called Shit You Don't Want to Talk About and I put that kind of stuff in there too
But it's where I put all of my updates and streams, which I should be copying, pasting in there as well. I'm not yet, but I will. And we also, I have a show called Shit You Don't Want to Talk About and I put that kind of stuff in there too It's been on pause while I get to teach Gen Tech back up and running, but I will get both working. But that's why I'm doing TypeScript is to, uh, do my homework so I can finish building my site because I've been stuck. Oh, see, like, I don't want to sell anybody on it
It's been on pause while I get to teach Gen Tech back up and running, but I will get both working. But that's why I'm doing TypeScript is to, uh, do my homework so I can finish building my site because I've been stuck. Oh, see, like, I don't want to sell anybody on it It's like wherever you find your community, I'm in a shit ton of servers. But this one's like special to my heart. Like, I don't know. It's just the easiest. They're super techy people in this discord that make me level up. And it's one of my favorite things is as a newbie
It's like wherever you find your community, I'm in a shit ton of servers. But this one's like special to my heart. Like, I don't know. It's just the easiest. They're super techy people in this discord that make me level up. And it's one of my favorite things is as a newbie They've been very patient with me and have learned to help me gauge on, okay, am I just really stuck and I need somebody to help me give me the answer or push back on like, no, Jen, go figure it out yourself. So it's like a mixture of the two. So I really appreciate them
They've been very patient with me and have learned to help me gauge on, okay, am I just really stuck and I need somebody to help me give me the answer or push back on like, no, Jen, go figure it out yourself. So it's like a mixture of the two. So I really appreciate them And that's why I love it because I get to talk about mental health and tech newbeness and super techy people. And we're playing the expanse, which is fun. I love it. It's like a, if you have it, have you all seen the expanse or read the books? Oh, so I can..
And that's why I love it because I get to talk about mental health and tech newbeness and super techy people. And we're playing the expanse, which is fun. I love it. It's like a, if you have it, have you all seen the expanse or read the books? Oh, so I can.... Yay! I don't know if my mouse just died. Right? Why did you disconnect? Did you just die? Why? Hmm, okay. Momentary pause of... Apparently I didn't realize my thing was in charging and I need to find... aha, there's a charger. My very messy desk. So messy. Okay, see if that works
.. Yay! I don't know if my mouse just died. Right? Why did you disconnect? Did you just die? Why? Hmm, okay. Momentary pause of... Apparently I didn't realize my thing was in charging and I need to find... aha, there's a charger. My very messy desk. So messy. Okay, see if that works I'm gonna plug that. Should work here, Mom and Kelly. I'll awkwardly use my laptop for now. And go say hi really quick. Yay! Oh, damn, you got like a full copy and paste bio. That is cool and smart. Wait, bye. Okay, that is smart. I'm like totally smart
I'm gonna plug that. Should work here, Mom and Kelly. I'll awkwardly use my laptop for now. And go say hi really quick. Yay! Oh, damn, you got like a full copy and paste bio. That is cool and smart. Wait, bye. Okay, that is smart. I'm like totally smart I'm gonna leave it there and other people will reply to you and say hi. Yay! That's exciting. Thank you. Okay, so I... But yes, if you want to come teach me classes, like let's connect because um..
I'm gonna leave it there and other people will reply to you and say hi. Yay! That's exciting. Thank you. Okay, so I... But yes, if you want to come teach me classes, like let's connect because um.... Have you ever heard of Josha or this book learning TypeScript? I have mine like inverted right now, but I have it on dark mode. Need to do, I'm gonna go to chapters. Chapter, chapter, chapter. Okay. Okay, okay. This book, definitely worthwhile
.. Have you ever heard of Josha or this book learning TypeScript? I have mine like inverted right now, but I have it on dark mode. Need to do, I'm gonna go to chapters. Chapter, chapter, chapter. Okay. Okay, okay. This book, definitely worthwhile Um, because it talks about like what we've gone through so far. And let me make this one. Oh yeah, it smells isn't working. You gotta use this one. Make this one bigger so you can see it. Is we've been going through..
Um, because it talks about like what we've gone through so far. And let me make this one. Oh yeah, it smells isn't working. You gotta use this one. Make this one bigger so you can see it. Is we've been going through.... Yes, it's a table of contents of this book, but we've gone through part one which went through um like the very beginning of TypeScript to the Type System, Unions and Literals, Objects, Functions, Arrays, oh my gosh, Interfaces
.. Yes, it's a table of contents of this book, but we've gone through part one which went through um like the very beginning of TypeScript to the Type System, Unions and Literals, Objects, Functions, Arrays, oh my gosh, Interfaces And we've done this over the last year and then top next is classes, which Josh was like, yo, we can totally go through this chapter or we could skip it, but maybe you should have someone on the show about classes
And we've done this over the last year and then top next is classes, which Josh was like, yo, we can totally go through this chapter or we could skip it, but maybe you should have someone on the show about classes And when we were going through this, we realized that chapter one homework had classes in it and that is that is why I'm skipping it. And let me go back to finding the correct chapter that I was on. Chapter is us. So summary of chapter one before I go look at homework for the other one
And when we were going through this, we realized that chapter one homework had classes in it and that is that is why I'm skipping it. And let me go back to finding the correct chapter that I was on. Chapter is us. So summary of chapter one before I go look at homework for the other one It's just a brief history of JavaScript, the pitfalls of... I think this is really smart because it's like the costly freedom, uh documentation and development tooling. I think it's been very interesting and pseudo just to give you a heads up and any like for background for everybody else too
It's just a brief history of JavaScript, the pitfalls of... I think this is really smart because it's like the costly freedom, uh documentation and development tooling. I think it's been very interesting and pseudo just to give you a heads up and any like for background for everybody else too I as much as I know about JavaScript, I know about TypeScript because I've been learning them at the same time where a lot of people are like, yeah, you should know JavaScript first. Even Josh was like, yeah, you should probably know JavaScript first
I as much as I know about JavaScript, I know about TypeScript because I've been learning them at the same time where a lot of people are like, yeah, you should know JavaScript first. Even Josh was like, yeah, you should probably know JavaScript first I, you know, like to do things the hard way apparently and have been learning this as I go, which has been very great because Josh has been very patient with helping me figure out, is this a JavaScript thing or a TypeScript which I'm very, very grateful for
I, you know, like to do things the hard way apparently and have been learning this as I go, which has been very great because Josh has been very patient with helping me figure out, is this a JavaScript thing or a TypeScript which I'm very, very grateful for So some of the what is TypeScript of the language, the TypeChecker compiler and language service, the advantages, which I think is pretty self-explanatory, but I like that he put freedom through restriction and I'm like, it's true, it brings structure
So some of the what is TypeScript of the language, the TypeChecker compiler and language service, the advantages, which I think is pretty self-explanatory, but I like that he put freedom through restriction and I'm like, it's true, it brings structure I have a talk coming out next week about that and then write some code and what TypeScript is not, it's not a remedy for bad code like if you don't know what you're doing, it's not going to get any better. You're still not going to know what you're doing, which is lovely
I have a talk coming out next week about that and then write some code and what TypeScript is not, it's not a remedy for bad code like if you don't know what you're doing, it's not going to get any better. You're still not going to know what you're doing, which is lovely It's such a wonderful experience and then extensions to JavaScript. It's not slower to JavaScript and it's not done and some of the favorite parts of the book are there's like little funny things in them. What happens if you spot errors running in TypeScript compiler? You better go catch them
It's such a wonderful experience and then extensions to JavaScript. It's not slower to JavaScript and it's not done and some of the favorite parts of the book are there's like little funny things in them. What happens if you spot errors running in TypeScript compiler? You better go catch them Okay, this is why I told Josh that I can get through his book because there's funny and funny things and I've been using my iPad to go through this and take notes. So chapter two, the Type System, you can kind of see that happening of JavaScript's power comes from flexibility. Be careful with that
Okay, this is why I told Josh that I can get through his book because there's funny and funny things and I've been using my iPad to go through this and take notes. So chapter two, the Type System, you can kind of see that happening of JavaScript's power comes from flexibility. Be careful with that I just like think they're so fun. They're so fun. But okay, I'm going to mute myself while the dog decides to go a little bananas. Maybe. Is she done? No, no, she's not. BRB on mute. Hopefully, it really dude. Okay, BRBL, I'm going to go see if I can get the dog to suspect
I just like think they're so fun. They're so fun. But okay, I'm going to mute myself while the dog decides to go a little bananas. Maybe. Is she done? No, no, she's not. BRB on mute. Hopefully, it really dude. Okay, BRBL, I'm going to go see if I can get the dog to suspect Okay, I think we're good. And just to go back here. Do you need you? So, pseudo-use stream and I'm curious, do you have any pets? Because I'm just like how many people does this happen to where it's like your animal is inevitably going to like be super annoyed
Okay, I think we're good. And just to go back here. Do you need you? So, pseudo-use stream and I'm curious, do you have any pets? Because I'm just like how many people does this happen to where it's like your animal is inevitably going to like be super annoyed Why I saw in your intro that you definitely work a ton, is that a big reason why you don't stream a lot? Okay, I'm not going to go through the entire chapter. But we have it here when we need it. I'm going to go here. I'm going to make this even bigger. Projects
Why I saw in your intro that you definitely work a ton, is that a big reason why you don't stream a lot? Okay, I'm not going to go through the entire chapter. But we have it here when we need it. I'm going to go here. I'm going to make this even bigger. Projects Projects. And if anyone wants to follow along, I have this is Josh's site or the book site. Okay. Oh yeah, I totally... I get that. I totally get that
Projects. And if anyone wants to follow along, I have this is Josh's site or the book site. Okay. Oh yeah, I totally... I get that. I totally get that I totally get that. For those watching back on the playback or just joining the conversation, a bit about like streaming on Twitch or being able to get followers is something I'm not great at. Because you need consistency. Consistency on like times and like Twitch gets happy and we'll show up
I totally get that. For those watching back on the playback or just joining the conversation, a bit about like streaming on Twitch or being able to get followers is something I'm not great at. Because you need consistency. Consistency on like times and like Twitch gets happy and we'll show up If you stream at the same time every week. And it's hard to do that. Like it is difficult to always do that no matter what. And even for me, if I have a guest, if I don't have a guest or if I just don't have the mental capacity to do it, it's a big reason my other show got put on the back burner
If you stream at the same time every week. And it's hard to do that. Like it is difficult to always do that no matter what. And even for me, if I have a guest, if I don't have a guest or if I just don't have the mental capacity to do it, it's a big reason my other show got put on the back burner And I feel it's a balance. And I think a lot of people don't get that unless you have done content creation or have live streamed because people, at least from talking to people, I found that they're like, yo, like you don't, like you just get a talk and hang out. And it's like, yes, I do
And I feel it's a balance. And I think a lot of people don't get that unless you have done content creation or have live streamed because people, at least from talking to people, I found that they're like, yo, like you don't, like you just get a talk and hang out. And it's like, yes, I do And it's so fun. But it's also a lot of energy because it's not me just sitting in bed napping, cuddling with the dog. So yes. And for networking pseudo, is there like anyone or any job in particular, you're like, I really want to meet this person. Curious. Because networking is so vital
And it's so fun. But it's also a lot of energy because it's not me just sitting in bed napping, cuddling with the dog. So yes. And for networking pseudo, is there like anyone or any job in particular, you're like, I really want to meet this person. Curious. Because networking is so vital And it's definitely not like the only place where you will or won't like get a job, but it helps so much. Incredible amount. And I'm currently trying to like find out more about slush, but I need to focus focus focus focus. We need to do system of the clown. That is very silly Josh
And it's definitely not like the only place where you will or won't like get a job, but it helps so much. Incredible amount. And I'm currently trying to like find out more about slush, but I need to focus focus focus focus. We need to do system of the clown. That is very silly Josh Josh isn't here, but I'm still going to tell him how silly it is. Okay. And yes, y'all as I heads up, I'm going to awkwardly read some of this out loud because if I don't, I will skip words and letters and that's what I do and why I hate dogs so much. But hey, practice practice practice practice
Josh isn't here, but I'm still going to tell him how silly it is. Okay. And yes, y'all as I heads up, I'm going to awkwardly read some of this out loud because if I don't, I will skip words and letters and that's what I do and why I hate dogs so much. But hey, practice practice practice practice That totally makes sense, pseudo. I agree with that. For me, I guess like one person I really want to meet that I feel like I would I'm going to stutter one day when I meet her. It's just I'm going to book out. You're so cool. I don't know what to say to you is Arlene Hamilton. Arlene Hamilton
That totally makes sense, pseudo. I agree with that. For me, I guess like one person I really want to meet that I feel like I would I'm going to stutter one day when I meet her. It's just I'm going to book out. You're so cool. I don't know what to say to you is Arlene Hamilton. Arlene Hamilton Arlene Hamilton. Yeah, see, I Google her way too much. This is Arlene. Okay, so anyone was curious and know her. You should be friends. And I would like to be friends too. She wrote this book it's about damn time. And I this may be a horrible paraphrase
Arlene Hamilton. Yeah, see, I Google her way too much. This is Arlene. Okay, so anyone was curious and know her. You should be friends. And I would like to be friends too. She wrote this book it's about damn time. And I this may be a horrible paraphrase It's talking about her experience from knowing that she wants to go out and do more to like she was living like she was homeless for a bit. And then working her ass off through networking through learning through doing so much to starting backstage capital when she wanted to go into VC funding
It's talking about her experience from knowing that she wants to go out and do more to like she was living like she was homeless for a bit. And then working her ass off through networking through learning through doing so much to starting backstage capital when she wanted to go into VC funding And it's just so cool. And then there's like she was a band manager for a while and traveled with me. I'm just yeah. There's so much. And hi Anthony. I'm going to meet her someday. We're going to be friends. Well, that sounds really creepy, but I do want to be friends. But yeah, that is Arlene
And it's just so cool. And then there's like she was a band manager for a while and traveled with me. I'm just yeah. There's so much. And hi Anthony. I'm going to meet her someday. We're going to be friends. Well, that sounds really creepy, but I do want to be friends. But yeah, that is Arlene In case anybody would like to go be friends with Arlene. You guys are just going to get the whole Google search so you can search it yourself later about how amazing. And pseudo, that's somebody that you could connect with is Anthony. Yeah, Anthony, I'm just fallen, fallen telling you
In case anybody would like to go be friends with Arlene. You guys are just going to get the whole Google search so you can search it yourself later about how amazing. And pseudo, that's somebody that you could connect with is Anthony. Yeah, Anthony, I'm just fallen, fallen telling you Anthony is my internet big brother, which congratulations you got married. I've been telling everybody. Yeah, I know Anthony. You don't connect with anyone. He's sarcastic. I mean, yeah, if you want to see, oh Anthony, well, a lot of people are a part of the talk. I just, I'm doing. Yeah
Anthony is my internet big brother, which congratulations you got married. I've been telling everybody. Yeah, I know Anthony. You don't connect with anyone. He's sarcastic. I mean, yeah, if you want to see, oh Anthony, well, a lot of people are a part of the talk. I just, I'm doing. Yeah Yeah. This is a problem with me live streaming by myself is I get really distracted. That's okay. We are going to edit it. So you guys can see it. Different pieces. You don't get to see the whole thing. You got to like go to the the talk
Yeah. This is a problem with me live streaming by myself is I get really distracted. That's okay. We are going to edit it. So you guys can see it. Different pieces. You don't get to see the whole thing. You got to like go to the the talk Yeah, Anthony, aren't you part of OSRG as well? You introduced me to everybody. So you should be. Yay. Okay. Look, look, look, I have a clip in this talk from my very first stream with the Gary and then oh, we're coming fear of mistakes. Just kidding. Making mistakes. And then it's Anthony
Yeah, Anthony, aren't you part of OSRG as well? You introduced me to everybody. So you should be. Yay. Okay. Look, look, look, I have a clip in this talk from my very first stream with the Gary and then oh, we're coming fear of mistakes. Just kidding. Making mistakes. And then it's Anthony I'm very excited about this. Anthony, do you know what clip this is? Like just by looking at it, do you remember what clip this is? I'm curious. Yep. Yep. Yes. Yay. And then I have Jay in here. And then I have Josh in here. Oh, I got Laura too. I need to tell Laura that she's in this talk
I'm very excited about this. Anthony, do you know what clip this is? Like just by looking at it, do you remember what clip this is? I'm curious. Yep. Yep. Yes. Yay. And then I have Jay in here. And then I have Josh in here. Oh, I got Laura too. I need to tell Laura that she's in this talk It's funny. I talk about Laura a lot, but I haven't talked to her in a while. Yes, this is a very fast scroll through of this talk about learning typescript too. And look, it's from last week. And apparently we're in the same shirt I was wearing last week on Tuesday. This might be my Tuesday shirt
It's funny. I talk about Laura a lot, but I haven't talked to her in a while. Yes, this is a very fast scroll through of this talk about learning typescript too. And look, it's from last week. And apparently we're in the same shirt I was wearing last week on Tuesday. This might be my Tuesday shirt I'm not sure. And yeah. So there's a clip from Josh. Is that right? I don't think there's any more clips. No. We. Oh, what is that? Oh, interesting. I don't know if I could do that. But it's cool. I also. Maybe I think it could be good practice. It could be good practice. But I do need to do this
I'm not sure. And yeah. So there's a clip from Josh. Is that right? I don't think there's any more clips. No. We. Oh, what is that? Oh, interesting. I don't know if I could do that. But it's cool. I also. Maybe I think it could be good practice. It could be good practice. But I do need to do this What up, Nami? And you are using it for your talk? Do you? How easy is it to do this? Y'all, you are distracting me with all the good info and curiosities. We need to stick to this. I kind of stick to this. I kind of get through at least one chapter. Okay. Easy. Subjective. That is so true
What up, Nami? And you are using it for your talk? Do you? How easy is it to do this? Y'all, you are distracting me with all the good info and curiosities. We need to stick to this. I kind of stick to this. I kind of get through at least one chapter. Okay. Easy. Subjective. That is so true That is so true. It is so true. I just started doing Moitai. And yesterday was my third day. And I was like, I cannot get the like movements. Like what the teacher kept telling me I was trying to do, but my body was not doing what I thought I was doing. And it was really funny
That is so true. It is so true. I just started doing Moitai. And yesterday was my third day. And I was like, I cannot get the like movements. Like what the teacher kept telling me I was trying to do, but my body was not doing what I thought I was doing. And it was really funny And he was just like, you know, if I try to go swim right now, I can't really swim. It's not going to get any better each time if I don't keep trying it. And I was like, oh, thanks. Maybe feel better because I just started learning swim too. And I am getting better. Okay
And he was just like, you know, if I try to go swim right now, I can't really swim. It's not going to get any better each time if I don't keep trying it. And I was like, oh, thanks. Maybe feel better because I just started learning swim too. And I am getting better. Okay Okay. System of a clown, a learning TypeScript type system appetizer project. You'll practice adding in TypeScript type annotations to JavaScript code to find bucks. Please help me. Help me please. See, look, I'm like already reading it backwards. Help me please
Okay. System of a clown, a learning TypeScript type system appetizer project. You'll practice adding in TypeScript type annotations to JavaScript code to find bucks. Please help me. Help me please. See, look, I'm like already reading it backwards. Help me please Help me please. I had planned an elaborate clown theme surprise party for my best friend. The whole event was planned with using a few files of TypeScript code I've written. My friends somehow caught wind of the party and enlisted the clown top to vandalize the program
Help me please. I had planned an elaborate clown theme surprise party for my best friend. The whole event was planned with using a few files of TypeScript code I've written. My friends somehow caught wind of the party and enlisted the clown top to vandalize the program Not only did the clowns remove or make incorrect my TypeScript type annotations, they introduced subtle bugs by suddenly changing some of the values. Could you please add correct type annotations in the files and fix any bugs detected in my TypeScript, your my surprise clown celebrations last hope
Not only did the clowns remove or make incorrect my TypeScript type annotations, they introduced subtle bugs by suddenly changing some of the values. Could you please add correct type annotations in the files and fix any bugs detected in my TypeScript, your my surprise clown celebrations last hope And I really just want to say, Josh, like why so creepy? Data structures and algorithms. Oh, what part of data structures? Who do we need to have on the show? And algorithms
And I really just want to say, Josh, like why so creepy? Data structures and algorithms. Oh, what part of data structures? Who do we need to have on the show? And algorithms I don't do a lot of algorithms, but I mean, between all the people's, we could find people to be on the show about algorithms. That would be, we could definitely do that. So many notifications. I hear things. That's a. Sorry, I just said I hear things. It's like I hear a ghost. It's my sixth set
I don't do a lot of algorithms, but I mean, between all the people's, we could find people to be on the show about algorithms. That would be, we could definitely do that. So many notifications. I hear things. That's a. Sorry, I just said I hear things. It's like I hear a ghost. It's my sixth set It's my sixth set. Okay. Too distracted. Oh, that's true, Anthony. Consistency and try to solve a few things each day. Why we're doing this? I don't think I've set that up yet. Oh my god, I have so many reboes that I don't use. I think it's well, that's weird. And there we go. Planting TypeScript
It's my sixth set. Okay. Too distracted. Oh, that's true, Anthony. Consistency and try to solve a few things each day. Why we're doing this? I don't think I've set that up yet. Oh my god, I have so many reboes that I don't use. I think it's well, that's weird. And there we go. Planting TypeScript What? Oh, wow, I haven't updated this in a hot minute. And I didn't put all the other stuff in here. Well, let's do that. We don't need Canva. I'm going to put this in different browsers so I don't close it. Like, it was from eight months ago when we were working on chapter two
What? Oh, wow, I haven't updated this in a hot minute. And I didn't put all the other stuff in here. Well, let's do that. We don't need Canva. I'm going to put this in different browsers so I don't close it. Like, it was from eight months ago when we were working on chapter two Oh, on February 3rd. Okay, that's pretty cool. And so if I want to do these, and do these, y'all, I haven't done this in a hot minute. Because I know I want to fork it, but I want to put it in this repo. So I would fork this. I'm going to think this one through. And then upload to here. I think
Oh, on February 3rd. Okay, that's pretty cool. And so if I want to do these, and do these, y'all, I haven't done this in a hot minute. Because I know I want to fork it, but I want to put it in this repo. So I would fork this. I'm going to think this one through. And then upload to here. I think I think. I think. I don't know. Let's try it. Let's uh. Don't fork it as much as I just want to local. I need to clone it. Or do I fork it? My hat hurts. Um. Yeah, I just want to copy it. Okay, cool. That's, thank you. Yeah. And then when I upload it, I can upload it to here. Wait
I think. I think. I don't know. Let's try it. Let's uh. Don't fork it as much as I just want to local. I need to clone it. Or do I fork it? My hat hurts. Um. Yeah, I just want to copy it. Okay, cool. That's, thank you. Yeah. And then when I upload it, I can upload it to here. Wait Wait. So I want to put the copy in here. So if I download it, I can just move the files manually. It'll be fine. We'll figure it out. It'll, it'll be great. It's going to be. This is why I need to do this more often. Because my work has been mostly not this stuff for a while. Okay, cool
Wait. So I want to put the copy in here. So if I download it, I can just move the files manually. It'll be fine. We'll figure it out. It'll, it'll be great. It's going to be. This is why I need to do this more often. Because my work has been mostly not this stuff for a while. Okay, cool Okay, cool. And I'm also going to. Copy this one. You can't miss it in the way. Okay, cool. And then. Do weird shit over here. Why does it sound so? And then projects. I don't like if I just put projects in there. Should work. I don't think so. I don't know. We're going to feel it
Okay, cool. And I'm also going to. Copy this one. You can't miss it in the way. Okay, cool. And then. Do weird shit over here. Why does it sound so? And then projects. I don't like if I just put projects in there. Should work. I don't think so. I don't know. We're going to feel it Find out if I just broke shit. And I call what is this we call? Learning to create. And let me, if you're still there, have you already gone back to work? Because I thought you guys were like going on a honeymoon and stuff. And I'm like, you've been online a lot. Oh, okay. Oh, that's so fun
Find out if I just broke shit. And I call what is this we call? Learning to create. And let me, if you're still there, have you already gone back to work? Because I thought you guys were like going on a honeymoon and stuff. And I'm like, you've been online a lot. Oh, okay. Oh, that's so fun Oh, that's so fun. How long are you guys going to be in Italy? Okay. Oh, you want to do this? Yay. And. We are going to update us. We are. I'm going to say. I mean, I've script. How do I dox? What part of. Billy, are you going to? Are you not letting me commit? Oh, my god
Oh, that's so fun. How long are you guys going to be in Italy? Okay. Oh, you want to do this? Yay. And. We are going to update us. We are. I'm going to say. I mean, I've script. How do I dox? What part of. Billy, are you going to? Are you not letting me commit? Oh, my god Why do you look so weird? Come on. Oh, fun. Oh, can you not going to be. There we go, maybe. Now put projects within it. So why is it not uploading? I'm going to figure this out. At the moment I really hate you. What the bluerner? Changes. Okay, maybe that will tell you to stop being so weird
Why do you look so weird? Come on. Oh, fun. Oh, can you not going to be. There we go, maybe. Now put projects within it. So why is it not uploading? I'm going to figure this out. At the moment I really hate you. What the bluerner? Changes. Okay, maybe that will tell you to stop being so weird I uploaded the folder so I don't understand why you're telling me that it hasn't updated at anything. Okay, look, it's there.

So Anthony was, I like to call him my internet big brother. He's also one of the first people I made friends with on about all of this stuff It was weird to not just like do whatever he was suggesting and learning that there's different ways of doing things, which was nice to learn, but also really weird to go against it. And the added benefit of remote development. I've. I've been curious about that because
It was weird to not just like do whatever he was suggesting and learning that there's different ways of doing things, which was nice to learn, but also really weird to go against it.

And to do. Okay, to this update. So I can actually go work on what I was supposed to be working on. Oh, that helps. And. These like over. Ah, that could be it. Yay. For those of you that are still here, I am curious if there was something that you wanted to learn about on Jason show or more of a newer newbie perspective, what's something that you would want to learn. And we're talking about algorithms earlier. The algorithms were a big thing. There we go. And these. Oh, yeah. I like that. And thank you for the follow. Yay. I. One of my first streams was with React
Jason show or more of a newer newbie perspective, what's something that you would want to learn. And we're talking about algorithms earlier. The algorithms were a big thing. There we go. And these. Oh, yeah. I like that. And thank you for the follow. Yay. I. One of my first streams was with React And I haven't been doing a tons since then. I'm just trying to think of. All the different streams we've done. I don't know if I've done much more than that. This is why I'm slowly getting these updated because I'm like, I need to actually remember what streams. I've done. That would help
And I haven't been doing a tons since then. I'm just trying to think of. All the different streams we've done. I don't know if I've done much more than that. This is why I'm slowly getting these updated because I'm like, I need to actually remember what streams. I've done. That would help That would help. Which I think is just going to be a lot of coming on here and asking chat GPT help me. Maybe I'll get to it today. Let's see. I have like an hour left before I got to start heading out. Do some things. That was the other thing. I wanted to change before I stop. I need
That would help. Which I think is just going to be a lot of coming on here and asking chat GPT help me. Maybe I'll get to it today. Let's see. I have like an hour left before I got to start heading out. Do some things. That was the other thing. I wanted to change before I stop. I need I need. We don't want that either. The sooner I'm done with this, the sooner I can go work on the homework. I'm so excited. Oh wow. There's so many different sevens now. I did not know that. Let's go. Oh, I didn't mean six o'clock. Yo. See you. Let's see if this looks any more readable
I need. We don't want that either. The sooner I'm done with this, the sooner I can go work on the homework. I'm so excited. Oh wow. There's so many different sevens now. I did not know that. Let's go. Oh, I didn't mean six o'clock. Yo. See you. Let's see if this looks any more readable I guess I could do that too. Let's see. Let's put this at the beginning too. That way the homework is at the top as well. Yay. Is there a homework type? I don't know if that really reminds me of homework
I guess I could do that too. Let's see. Let's put this at the beginning too. That way the homework is at the top as well. Yay. Is there a homework type? I don't know if that really reminds me of homework Is there an emoji that reminds you all of homework? Is it like a pencil? Well, thank you for hanging out and lurking. There we go. That one just kind of reminds me of a teacher instead of school. That does make sense
Is there an emoji that reminds you all of homework? Is it like a pencil? Well, thank you for hanging out and lurking. There we go. That one just kind of reminds me of a teacher instead of school. That does make sense What do you guys think of this pencil icon that I found? You think it should be one of those students dead? I'm going to update it and then we can change it. Yeah. Thank you, Anthony. Yes, let's do one of those two. Why? I think it's easier to read if they weren't on the same line
What do you guys think of this pencil icon that I found? You think it should be one of those students dead? I'm going to update it and then we can change it. Yeah. Thank you, Anthony. Yes, let's do one of those two. Why? I think it's easier to read if they weren't on the same line You know, that would help. I'm going to do it. Why not how you spell it for me? I think you're right. Okay. Let's see. Please, I want to be done with this. I just want to have it figured out. Oh, I didn't think that would help. Yes, you do need to do that, Jen. Yes, please. Please do that
You know, that would help. I'm going to do it. Why not how you spell it for me? I think you're right. Okay. Let's see. Please, I want to be done with this. I just want to have it figured out. Oh, I didn't think that would help. Yes, you do need to do that, Jen. Yes, please. Please do that Please do that. Thank you. I feel like this is easy enough to read. To find the projects. Maybe not that one, but I won't update the rest. I won't update until I do the rest of them. Okay. Do do do. Get the rest of their projects and their about only five more to go. No big deal
Please do that. Thank you. I feel like this is easy enough to read. To find the projects. Maybe not that one, but I won't update the rest. I won't update until I do the rest of them. Okay. Do do do. Get the rest of their projects and their about only five more to go. No big deal No big deal. No, no, that needs that too. Do do do do. Okay. Smallest font offer. Okay, so you have. Okay. I'm just missing chapter. What did I do? I don't know. I have two five. That's fun. Chapter three is unions and minerals. Chapter four is objects. I don't know when that was very spot. Okay
No big deal. No, no, that needs that too. Do do do do. Okay. Smallest font offer. Okay, so you have. Okay. I'm just missing chapter. What did I do? I don't know. I have two five. That's fun. Chapter three is unions and minerals. Chapter four is objects. I don't know when that was very spot. Okay Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Shh. Okay. Yes, you need these things. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I know I kept saying that I'm going to get to you doing the chapter, but my hunger may not agree with me, which would be very annoying. Okay. Chapter four. Do do do. Okay
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Shh. Okay. Yes, you need these things. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I know I kept saying that I'm going to get to you doing the chapter, but my hunger may not agree with me, which would be very annoying. Okay. Chapter four. Do do do. Okay Do do do. Okay. What time is it where all of you are? Because it's noon here, 1214. So not too early, not too late. But I start my day at 5 a.m., like my first call normally starts at 5 a.m. Oh, dude, 10 p.m
Do do do. Okay. What time is it where all of you are? Because it's noon here, 1214. So not too early, not too late. But I start my day at 5 a.m., like my first call normally starts at 5 a.m. Oh, dude, 10 p.mm. Oh, dude, 10 p.m. These, I think it's like midnight-ish or later where learner is, if learner is still online. That's late. I can't even imagine. But it's because I talk to people. And let's see. I think Finland is 10 hours ahead. From where I'm at now, not nine hours. So yeah, I have my 5 a.m
m. Oh, dude, 10 p.m. These, I think it's like midnight-ish or later where learner is, if learner is still online. That's late. I can't even imagine. But it's because I talk to people. And let's see. I think Finland is 10 hours ahead. From where I'm at now, not nine hours. So yeah, I have my 5 a.mm. calls because it's 3 p.m. there. That makes sense. At least time zone, I think, same time area. Where are you fun, Perseus? Did I say it right? Perseus is one of the great gods or Roman gods. He was the slayer of Medusa. Okay. Yeah. That's cool. I'm like, I don't know my Greek mythology enough
m. calls because it's 3 p.m. there. That makes sense. At least time zone, I think, same time area. Where are you fun, Perseus? Did I say it right? Perseus is one of the great gods or Roman gods. He was the slayer of Medusa. Okay. Yeah. That's cool. I'm like, I don't know my Greek mythology enough Like, I know who Medusa is with turning men just own and with all the stakes. But not enough to be like, yeah, she deserved it. Or, no, how could you do that? That one I don't know. What would you say, Perseus? Do you think she deserved it? You probably know the story better. Type
Like, I know who Medusa is with turning men just own and with all the stakes. But not enough to be like, yeah, she deserved it. Or, no, how could you do that? That one I don't know. What would you say, Perseus? Do you think she deserved it? You probably know the story better. Type Type. Does it take anybody else as long to do read me's when they're like this? I mean, I get that I keep getting distracted, but I feel like it's taking me a really long time. Ah! Fair enough. That's a good call out because she's kept turning everybody to stone. That makes sense
Type. Does it take anybody else as long to do read me's when they're like this? I mean, I get that I keep getting distracted, but I feel like it's taking me a really long time. Ah! Fair enough. That's a good call out because she's kept turning everybody to stone. That makes sense That makes sense. Protects everybody else. Yeah. Functions. Yeah. Well, Perseus, what are you working on today? Are anybody else joining? Are y'all up to anything fun? Are we working? Are co-working? Two more chapters left. Oh my gosh. I'm going to get there. It's going to happen
That makes sense. Protects everybody else. Yeah. Functions. Yeah. Well, Perseus, what are you working on today? Are anybody else joining? Are y'all up to anything fun? Are we working? Are co-working? Two more chapters left. Oh my gosh. I'm going to get there. It's going to happen It's going to happen. A card system for e-commerce website with next and redux. I feel like this is one of the hardest things that I've learned while learning live and also just being new to tech. I think that I would know something or when somebody references it. I'm like, oh, I should know that
It's going to happen. A card system for e-commerce website with next and redux. I feel like this is one of the hardest things that I've learned while learning live and also just being new to tech. I think that I would know something or when somebody references it. I'm like, oh, I should know that I'm not going to ask people about what is redux. Is an open source JavaScript library? Y'all, I don't know how long my camera or my lights been off back there, but I just heard the dog. And she just knocked it over. She like cuddles on the lights. It's not hot, but it's okay. She's really cute
I'm not going to ask people about what is redux. Is an open source JavaScript library? Y'all, I don't know how long my camera or my lights been off back there, but I just heard the dog. And she just knocked it over. She like cuddles on the lights. It's not hot, but it's okay. She's really cute She's really cute. But... Oh. With React or Angular. Okay. That's cool. Interesting. Oh. It's fancy. Nice. Are they going to be selling cool things? Or you're like, I don't even care because they just need to... They just pay you to do it. Oh. Is that all? Why is it odd? Please tell me
She's really cute. But... Oh. With React or Angular. Okay. That's cool. Interesting. Oh. It's fancy. Nice. Are they going to be selling cool things? Or you're like, I don't even care because they just need to... They just pay you to do it. Oh. Is that all? Why is it odd? Please tell me Do more chapters. Okay. I'm raised. Oh, shit. Thank you for the follow. R4BC31. That just means we think of like, RAB4. Which is like a mini SUV-ish car. Hand states. That does. That does. And... Two bowls. I remember this one. And that I thought it was such a weird word
Do more chapters. Okay. I'm raised. Oh, shit. Thank you for the follow. R4BC31. That just means we think of like, RAB4. Which is like a mini SUV-ish car. Hand states. That does. That does. And... Two bowls. I remember this one. And that I thought it was such a weird word I don't know if it's a real word. I don't know if it's a real word. And that's what I'm talking about. Speaking next, JS handles getting data via get server side props and get static procs. So, Redux and next JS is an interesting combo. Not knocking it. It's like a lot of things
I don't know if it's a real word. I don't know if it's a real word. And that's what I'm talking about. Speaking next, JS handles getting data via get server side props and get static procs. So, Redux and next JS is an interesting combo. Not knocking it. It's like a lot of things And some of the stuff that I was thinking about. I feel like we need to drop it again. It's the best discord server ever. And he yells at me to do good things in my life. And he does that to everybody. It's lovely. uh, his Twitter space tomorrow. What is? So I know, everybody go follow Jacob
And some of the stuff that I was thinking about. I feel like we need to drop it again. It's the best discord server ever. And he yells at me to do good things in my life. And he does that to everybody. It's lovely. uh, his Twitter space tomorrow. What is? So I know, everybody go follow Jacob We need to follow Jacob. Tell him nice things about himself. No, you guys don't need to see that. Yeah. I do need to follow up with people though. Uh. Go here, go here, go follow Jacob. Oh, I can, I can cry. I can kind of type. It's fine. It's cute
We need to follow Jacob. Tell him nice things about himself. No, you guys don't need to see that. Yeah. I do need to follow up with people though. Uh. Go here, go here, go follow Jacob. Oh, I can, I can cry. I can kind of type. It's fine. It's cute It's cute. But we need to tell him that we want to talk about this next time. Okay, I want to talk about it next time. Shay and I just associate you with it. So therefore it's a we. Post you post Jacob and the next code wireless address
It's cute. But we need to tell him that we want to talk about this next time. Okay, I want to talk about it next time. Shay and I just associate you with it. So therefore it's a we. Post you post Jacob and the next code wireless address She co never theta void of human cannot but I think you don't want him toziap. Post you post cheekup. And the next code and life life. I mean, yeah, yeah. Yeah, code in life. Wait
She co never theta void of human cannot but I think you don't want him toziap. Post you post cheekup. And the next code and life life. I mean, yeah, yeah. Yeah, code in life. Wait Wait. Unless you're like the not the person I thought you were and then that would be cool and you should just join code in life. Which is totally fine too. Because I just get people mixed up all the time, especially because everybody has different user names in different places
Wait. Unless you're like the not the person I thought you were and then that would be cool and you should just join code in life. Which is totally fine too. Because I just get people mixed up all the time, especially because everybody has different user names in different places And it gets really confusing. Oh, well, that's where I met you. So I'm associated with you there. Like, I met you there. Uh, need some state changes without changing page. And components are related and need client side changes
And it gets really confusing. Oh, well, that's where I met you. So I'm associated with you there. Like, I met you there. Uh, need some state changes without changing page. And components are related and need client side changes You'd use context API, but need redust, redux, thunk, and redux toolkit. Makes it so much. Makes so much easier. Well, I cannot read. I'm like skipping words. This is the frustrating thing about code and just lives dreaming. I just got my face out already. Like it's you. Oh, no, it's not you
You'd use context API, but need redust, redux, thunk, and redux toolkit. Makes it so much. Makes so much easier. Well, I cannot read. I'm like skipping words. This is the frustrating thing about code and just lives dreaming. I just got my face out already. Like it's you. Oh, no, it's not you Please know that that it is not you. So it is I honestly do skip words. And so it makes it really hard when like a big reason before every before many of you joined with the raid. I will have to read a lot of this out loud because I skip words
Please know that that it is not you. So it is I honestly do skip words. And so it makes it really hard when like a big reason before every before many of you joined with the raid. I will have to read a lot of this out loud because I skip words So even when I'm reading out loud, I still skip words because in my mind, if somebody is saying in first person, I mean, I could say they said in first person and read it that way. But I also translate it from first person to talking about that person. And then I mix up my free tenses
So even when I'm reading out loud, I still skip words because in my mind, if somebody is saying in first person, I mean, I could say they said in first person and read it that way. But I also translate it from first person to talking about that person. And then I mix up my free tenses But I'm really bad at English as it is. It's yeah, it's a thing. It is a thing. I'm going. I need here. Okay. Cool. And you need analyzing data. I don't really speaking if. Oh, rude. Oh, it does that. I'm surprised it made it as long. It randomly thank you for telling me that
But I'm really bad at English as it is. It's yeah, it's a thing. It is a thing. I'm going. I need here. Okay. Cool. And you need analyzing data. I don't really speaking if. Oh, rude. Oh, it does that. I'm surprised it made it as long. It randomly thank you for telling me that See, yeah, it just like stops in the. Like my OBS camera just like tries to take over like my camera is still connected and everything, but. It's just like no bro. Let me see. Okay. Let's try this. And this one. Yay. Hello again. Yeah, I was like, I don't want to see you guys anymore
See, yeah, it just like stops in the. Like my OBS camera just like tries to take over like my camera is still connected and everything, but. It's just like no bro. Let me see. Okay. Let's try this. And this one. Yay. Hello again. Yeah, I was like, I don't want to see you guys anymore I'm just kidding. We can't hang out. And generally speaking, if you. Oh, really? Oh, geez. I was hiding from creating the tweet. You can't prove that it was me. Wow. That's actually really weird. Yeah, I don't know why, but like it will
I'm just kidding. We can't hang out. And generally speaking, if you. Oh, really? Oh, geez. I was hiding from creating the tweet. You can't prove that it was me. Wow. That's actually really weird. Yeah, I don't know why, but like it will It may happen a few times, but normally it will happen like twice and then be fine. And it hasn't been happening at the very beginning. When I start using the camera, like it used to. But like it happens in a browser, but it doesn't happen in the computer
It may happen a few times, but normally it will happen like twice and then be fine. And it hasn't been happening at the very beginning. When I start using the camera, like it used to. But like it happens in a browser, but it doesn't happen in the computer Like if I have a photo booth up in the background. And just so that way, I can see if it stops as well. It doesn't. It's still going just fine. But the computer or the browser like kicks it to OBS. Which is just really weird and annoying. Let's hate. That's that's life. But okay
Like if I have a photo booth up in the background. And just so that way, I can see if it stops as well. It doesn't. It's still going just fine. But the computer or the browser like kicks it to OBS. Which is just really weird and annoying. Let's hate. That's that's life. But okay But okay. I'm going to read the things. Generally speaking, if you need state across components get across other UI. Other than UI state, it should be moved to the server. It's UI state. It should be in the context or via local state. I'm going to pretend like I know what that means
But okay. I'm going to read the things. Generally speaking, if you need state across components get across other UI. Other than UI state, it should be moved to the server. It's UI state. It should be in the context or via local state. I'm going to pretend like I know what that means I feel like I know what it means. I'm also thinking a lot about when Roy was on the show. We were talking about a lot of this. I have to think about this. I'm going to analyze DNA. Analyzing DNA. Here we go
I feel like I know what it means. I'm also thinking a lot about when Roy was on the show. We were talking about a lot of this. I have to think about this. I'm going to analyze DNA. Analyzing DNA. Here we go Here we go. How long did it take all of you to learn all of this? Because I get that I've only been in this for a year. But I feel like it is taking forever. I'm going to read the things. I'm going to read the things. I'm going to read the things. Okay. Good shot, Jaden. Like
Here we go. How long did it take all of you to learn all of this? Because I get that I've only been in this for a year. But I feel like it is taking forever. I'm going to read the things. I'm going to read the things. I'm going to read the things. Okay. Good shot, Jaden. Like Like. I get like never stop learning. I feel like it's like also. Is it ever going to get easier? Like, I don't I don't think that's the right way of saying it. But like, is it ever going to. The concepts. I feel like they start to click and then they don't click. I don't know
Like. I get like never stop learning. I feel like it's like also. Is it ever going to get easier? Like, I don't I don't think that's the right way of saying it. But like, is it ever going to. The concepts. I feel like they start to click and then they don't click. I don't know I don't know. What are things that you all recently learned? I'm curious. What other people are working on in learning? Ooh. I feel like Rust is really up and coming right now. Which only makes me grumpy because their icon is a crab. And the company I work for has a really adorable crab
I don't know. What are things that you all recently learned? I'm curious. What other people are working on in learning? Ooh. I feel like Rust is really up and coming right now. Which only makes me grumpy because their icon is a crab. And the company I work for has a really adorable crab And so people are like, is it Rust? But you know. Erryson. T.I.L. the places. Place items. Yes, that's property. Huh. I feel like I need to show you guys the pillow of the. The crabs. Because they're cute. Hold on to second. And maybe I'll fix my light. If my dog will let me. Let's see
And so people are like, is it Rust? But you know. Erryson. T.I.L. the places. Place items. Yes, that's property. Huh. I feel like I need to show you guys the pillow of the. The crabs. Because they're cute. Hold on to second. And maybe I'll fix my light. If my dog will let me. Let's see Let's see. Let's see if she let's see. Hey. Can I have this? Maybe. Just a little bit lighter. Okay. We're going. Now we're down to no lights on it. It's fine. It's fine. Right. Without heading my mic. Without heading the mic. Yeah. Look how adorable it is. It's so adorable. It is Ivan
Let's see. Let's see if she let's see. Hey. Can I have this? Maybe. Just a little bit lighter. Okay. We're going. Now we're down to no lights on it. It's fine. It's fine. Right. Without heading my mic. Without heading the mic. Yeah. Look how adorable it is. It's so adorable. It is Ivan It is Ivan. It's adorable. But not Rust. Other than that, I have no context of Rust. So. What is Rust about? Is it. No. Thank you. Thank you. But no. This crab's name is Rappo. And which is finished for crab because I work for a finished company. Uh
It is Ivan. It's adorable. But not Rust. Other than that, I have no context of Rust. So. What is Rust about? Is it. No. Thank you. Thank you. But no. This crab's name is Rappo. And which is finished for crab because I work for a finished company. Uh Uh. Oh, you guys are still talking about the server stuff. I feel like I'm going to have to like recap this one. Interesting. Steve. That is something that I do definitely want to get to. But I'm also just really loving learning about all the databases and data and all things data. A lot of fun
Uh. Oh, you guys are still talking about the server stuff. I feel like I'm going to have to like recap this one. Interesting. Steve. That is something that I do definitely want to get to. But I'm also just really loving learning about all the databases and data and all things data. A lot of fun A lot of fun. I forgot to do this. and ex then Learner, that is like, what ever I had. Like the words you're using make sense
A lot of fun. I forgot to do this. and ex then Learner, that is like, what ever I had. Like the words you're using make sense Russ is a programming language that doesn't use garbage collectors yet still lets you not deal with the complexity of manual, deallocating memory yourself in potentially undesirable ways
Russ is a programming language that doesn't use garbage collectors yet still lets you not deal with the complexity of manual, deallocating memory yourself in potentially undesirable ways I feel like that's when I start to get really confused as I'm like, um, how does that compare to like JavaScript then
I feel like that's when I start to get really confused as I'm like, um, how does that compare to like JavaScript then Because like the only context I have for like something like going is no, no, no, no, like, it wasn't, I mean, they're all kind of complicated, but, oh, Anthony is that for JavaScript then or for Rust that you have to declare how many bytes
Because like the only context I have for like something like going is no, no, no, no, like, it wasn't, I mean, they're all kind of complicated, but, oh, Anthony is that for JavaScript then or for Rust that you have to declare how many bytes I feel like I haven't done that in JavaScript, but I don't know
I feel like I haven't done that in JavaScript, but I don't know Okay. Interesting. Huh. Oh, there's so much to learn. Jaden, are you having, if you're still here, are you having fun learning Rust? Like what other languages do you know? Interesting
Okay. Interesting. Huh. Oh, there's so much to learn. Jaden, are you having, if you're still here, are you having fun learning Rust? Like what other languages do you know? Interesting I will say, I mean, if the school does find out, if y'all end up telling on me, it's okay, because it's been so long, I've never got a degree, but I went to school and took a semester and thought I was like, this is back when I was like, I want to be a developer
I will say, I mean, if the school does find out, if y'all end up telling on me, it's okay, because it's been so long, I've never got a degree, but I went to school and took a semester and thought I was like, this is back when I was like, I want to be a developer And like 12 years ago, and I took a C++ class and it did not click. No matter what I did, I could not get it. Back then I also didn't know that I was like ADHD or when I learned the best or any of that or that I'm dyslexic
And like 12 years ago, and I took a C++ class and it did not click. No matter what I did, I could not get it. Back then I also didn't know that I was like ADHD or when I learned the best or any of that or that I'm dyslexic So I paid somebody off a Craigslist to do my homework for me, but make the mistakes in there for me. Not the proudest moment, but also I still don't understand C++. That's okay
So I paid somebody off a Craigslist to do my homework for me, but make the mistakes in there for me. Not the proudest moment, but also I still don't understand C++. That's okay Perseus, I'm okay, this sounds weird because I'm not trying to push the server, I'm just trying to give a resource of if you wanted to join our discord server, we talk about this stuff a lot in there too, of how to use something, what's the best way to use it, like those type of things or resources
Perseus, I'm okay, this sounds weird because I'm not trying to push the server, I'm just trying to give a resource of if you wanted to join our discord server, we talk about this stuff a lot in there too, of how to use something, what's the best way to use it, like those type of things or resources So that is, if you want to check it out, you can join that server too. K, containing the conversation

I'm trying to think of where I can. I don't know. What is our 404? Needy, needy, needy. Needy, needy, needy

Probably way too much into this because I'm going to go to this. And then we're going to go to press kits. Because that's where my mind goes. Brand guide. Maybe. Did you all know that a lot of websites have this because
Now they don't have it on the 404. That's fine. We will go to. Probably way too much into this because I'm going to go to this. And then we're going to go to press kits.

Just look how cute our crepes. Look. I mean. I personally think our crepes cuter. It's friendlier. It's like, hey, how's it going? Not what up. I don't know. What do you guys think? Hughes is cuter. Rust. And I guess that's the other thing

That makes sense to me. I think crabs are crusty, but not rusty. They're not metal. Personal opinion here. I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm not going to be able to do that.

This is also what happens when you don't do them for. Like you're planning on. Okay. Okay. Look. It's that those giantus read me ever. I'm not. I'm not. Okay. We got to take waves. We got the breakdowns
All right. All right. Okay, I think I'm finally done with stupid read me. Amit. Yes. This is also what happens when you don't do them for. Like you're planning on. Okay. Okay. Look. It's that those giantus read me ever. I'm not. I'm not. Okay. We got to take waves. We got the breakdowns Some of them didn't go exactly right and I forgot to put the word project in them. Whatever. Probably bold that final thing. Huh. If anybody has time or feels like it, thank you Shane, that is awesome
Some of them didn't go exactly right and I forgot to put the word project in them. Whatever. Probably bold that final thing. Huh. If anybody has time or feels like it, thank you Shane, that is awesome If anybody has time and wants to go through and actually make sure that my links go to things and and all right, that would be awesome. And I'm really hoping it does not take me this long to get through. Okay, you guys can buy the book. I didn't know I had this up. But let's go up and paste it
If anybody has time and wants to go through and actually make sure that my links go to things and and all right, that would be awesome. And I'm really hoping it does not take me this long to get through. Okay, you guys can buy the book. I didn't know I had this up. But let's go up and paste it Oh yeah, because it's one of the links I have in the read me. There is the. But I actually wanted to do two hours ago when I started this stream. No big deal. Okay. We're going to go to system of the cloud. We've got it downloaded. We got it here. What are we doing? We probably need this. Maybe
Oh yeah, because it's one of the links I have in the read me. There is the. But I actually wanted to do two hours ago when I started this stream. No big deal. Okay. We're going to go to system of the cloud. We've got it downloaded. We got it here. What are we doing? We probably need this. Maybe Maybe. Maybe we need that. And I should already have node and all that. And go into. See me. Alex. The type is system. We're in flash system of a cloud. Really. Okay, fine. We're just going to mean only go through it over here. Yes. Projects. Oh, there's a project within projects
Maybe. Maybe we need that. And I should already have node and all that. And go into. See me. Alex. The type is system. We're in flash system of a cloud. Really. Okay, fine. We're just going to mean only go through it over here. Yes. Projects. Oh, there's a project within projects Well, that's okay. My bad. Um, the type system. System of the cloud. Okay. Oh, did it. I didn't realize that. It's definitely in my opinion worth the investment. I was like, this makes it has made it so much easier. And I think it's a great way of breaking it down. It's not like the normal
Well, that's okay. My bad. Um, the type system. System of the cloud. Okay. Oh, did it. I didn't realize that. It's definitely in my opinion worth the investment. I was like, this makes it has made it so much easier. And I think it's a great way of breaking it down. It's not like the normal How to say it like the normal. A lot of these books are really boring. That's that's an easier way of saying it. They're they're so overly academic and dull that it's like, I'm how am I going to learn? Okay, we don't need this. We don't need to put her up anymore. We can ignore the Twitter's

Oh, and snag it. And these folders. Yay. We got left. There we go. So. Let me move these vice versa. Open the your editor and the project's dress. Gray and your terminal run the TypeScript compiler via. TSC script within whichever step you're working on For example, to start the TypeScript compiler on the first step. And okay. We'll copy this, key up and see what happens. Okay. Okay, AST. Ah! Why wouldn't I have to... Yeah! Yeah! Are you okay? I'm fine

Let me see this one. Maybe I just... You know? Let me try this just to see if I didn't have it installed
