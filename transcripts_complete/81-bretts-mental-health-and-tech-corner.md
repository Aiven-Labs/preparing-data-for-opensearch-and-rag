Go check it out. Our things to ecam for their support of this show and relay ecam. Okay, sorry about that. So Brett, I tend to listen to this show that you do regularly called over tired And one, I want this to be a giant advertisement for over tired because I think people who listen to conduit should listen to over tired. One I think the shows sink really well. And one of the first things that I want to ask you about is the idea of a mental health corner
And one, I want this to be a giant advertisement for over tired because I think people who listen to conduit should listen to over tired. One I think the shows sink really well. And one of the first things that I want to ask you about is the idea of a mental health corner Like I forgot where this came from, but I've benefited from it so much. Like some of my favorite episodes were the entire show is just a mental health corner. Middle health corner for three hours. And then you're like, oh, crap, we got to also do this like gratitude thing
Like I forgot where this came from, but I've benefited from it so much. Like some of my favorite episodes were the entire show is just a mental health corner. Middle health corner for three hours. And then you're like, oh, crap, we got to also do this like gratitude thing And then like call it a day. But tell the audience a little bit more about one over tired as a show, but then two specifically the mental health corner portion of it. Well, over tired started Christina Warren and I were in San Francisco. I don't remember what for I think it was a Mac world
And then like call it a day. But tell the audience a little bit more about one over tired as a show, but then two specifically the mental health corner portion of it. Well, over tired started Christina Warren and I were in San Francisco. I don't remember what for I think it was a Mac world And we were in an elevator and we were having our typical rapid fire ADHD conversation. And we were like, man, we should record this. And Dan Benjamin was in town. And we presented the idea of a just an ADHD podcast. And he was all in on it. I was currently at systematic on five by five
And we were in an elevator and we were having our typical rapid fire ADHD conversation. And we were like, man, we should record this. And Dan Benjamin was in town. And we presented the idea of a just an ADHD podcast. And he was all in on it. I was currently at systematic on five by five And we started, we started with a live show and we hated that. And went to an edited up what do you call it live live to tape? I don't remember the words. But yeah, and it became that and that was almost a decade ago. And we've kept it going on and off
And we started, we started with a live show and we hated that. And went to an edited up what do you call it live live to tape? I don't remember the words. But yeah, and it became that and that was almost a decade ago. And we've kept it going on and off And we recently added Jeff Severin's console who has been a welcome addition to the show to kind of temper like Christina. And I can get very hyper focused. And Christina especially is a Wikipedia of knowledge, especially about like 90s teen dramas on TV
And we recently added Jeff Severin's console who has been a welcome addition to the show to kind of temper like Christina. And I can get very hyper focused. And Christina especially is a Wikipedia of knowledge, especially about like 90s teen dramas on TV And but she knows she knows so much about everything. And she can just talk and talk and talk. And and that's kind of half the appeal of the show, I think, to a good portion of our listeners. It's just here in Christina, like nerd out about stuff. But we're both ADHD. I am also bipolar
And but she knows she knows so much about everything. And she can just talk and talk and talk. And and that's kind of half the appeal of the show, I think, to a good portion of our listeners. It's just here in Christina, like nerd out about stuff. But we're both ADHD. I am also bipolar I am also bipolar. Jeff is bipolar and ADHD. And we found ourselves just kind of checking in at the beginning of every show in one week. Someone was like, well, I guess that's it for the mental health corner almost sarcastically. And that's what it became called
I am also bipolar. Jeff is bipolar and ADHD. And we found ourselves just kind of checking in at the beginning of every show in one week. Someone was like, well, I guess that's it for the mental health corner almost sarcastically. And that's what it became called And now it's a regular segment of the show. We usually kick it off with the mental health corner. Every once in a while, we'll skip it when there's more pressing things to talk about. And sometimes the mental health corner devolves would not devolves, but expands into like other topics
And now it's a regular segment of the show. We usually kick it off with the mental health corner. Every once in a while, we'll skip it when there's more pressing things to talk about. And sometimes the mental health corner devolves would not devolves, but expands into like other topics And it's not self-contained. It's not like, no, the mental health corner is over. And it kind of again, it does span the whole show. But yeah, it's the part of the show that we hear the most about
And it's not self-contained. It's not like, no, the mental health corner is over. And it kind of again, it does span the whole show. But yeah, it's the part of the show that we hear the most about I get a lot of a lot of our email and discourse or discord posting is specifically about things like ADHD, especially, but people that have found, found themselves, I guess, like a mirror in hearing us talk and also people who have found the voice to talk about their own mental health by hearing us be very open about issues that we have
I get a lot of a lot of our email and discourse or discord posting is specifically about things like ADHD, especially, but people that have found, found themselves, I guess, like a mirror in hearing us talk and also people who have found the voice to talk about their own mental health by hearing us be very open about issues that we have And yeah, did that answer the question? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Okay. I think one of the things that the mental health corner in general has helped me with, especially like in my career, because I mean, again, like this, like, over tired has spanned my entire like career intake
And yeah, did that answer the question? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Okay. I think one of the things that the mental health corner in general has helped me with, especially like in my career, because I mean, again, like this, like, over tired has spanned my entire like career intake And now I've gone from like, you know, very junior level several years into being at like a staff level advocate
And now I've gone from like, you know, very junior level several years into being at like a staff level advocate And like, while I don't have direct reports, I have people that ask me about mentorship and people that I work with that are like, what should I do
And like, while I don't have direct reports, I have people that ask me about mentorship and people that I work with that are like, what should I do And often, often I find myself seeing the mental health struggle first, then seeing like the very clear corporate issue of, oh, hey, you didn't crank this widget or you didn't output whatever value enough times
And often, often I find myself seeing the mental health struggle first, then seeing like the very clear corporate issue of, oh, hey, you didn't crank this widget or you didn't output whatever value enough times So your review or your, you know, quarterly review or whatever is going to be negative, looking at that from the perspective of you're not a failure, you have things going on. And with me not being your manager, you don't have to, one, you don't have to tell your manager anything
So your review or your, you know, quarterly review or whatever is going to be negative, looking at that from the perspective of you're not a failure, you have things going on. And with me not being your manager, you don't have to, one, you don't have to tell your manager anything You don't want to tell your manager
You don't want to tell your manager But also not being your manager, there's a level of confidentiality that I can hold that maybe a manager can't that I can go, hey, is everything okay
But also not being your manager, there's a level of confidentiality that I can hold that maybe a manager can't that I can go, hey, is everything okay Or hey, I noticed this thing or I noticed in this meeting, you, you were kind of spoken over or talked over, how would you like me to handle this in the future? Would you like me to speak up? Are you good? Are you not good
Or hey, I noticed this thing or I noticed in this meeting, you, you were kind of spoken over or talked over, how would you like me to handle this in the future? Would you like me to speak up? Are you good? Are you not good And a lot of that comes from confidence that I get from, you know, you, Christina, and now, you know, more recently, Jeff, being able to empathize with one another, offer advice and offer it from like a level of like, criticalness or critique, not necessarily from like the, I'm sorry that happened, that really sucked
And a lot of that comes from confidence that I get from, you know, you, Christina, and now, you know, more recently, Jeff, being able to empathize with one another, offer advice and offer it from like a level of like, criticalness or critique, not necessarily from like the, I'm sorry that happened, that really sucked Moving on because I'm afraid to step on an egg shell. But yeah, that, the reason I think that that works so well with conduit is just, again, conduit's never really been about, if you do this, you'll be more productive
Moving on because I'm afraid to step on an egg shell. But yeah, that, the reason I think that that works so well with conduit is just, again, conduit's never really been about, if you do this, you'll be more productive It's more like, hey, have you noticed that this thing happens? And when this thing happens, you struggle like, no, just me, okay, cool, or not just me
It's more like, hey, have you noticed that this thing happens? And when this thing happens, you struggle like, no, just me, okay, cool, or not just me How did you, how did you go about fixing that because I don't know? So I feel like we don't necessarily, we don't necessarily tie directly our mental health into like the things that we're doing
How did you, how did you go about fixing that because I don't know? So I feel like we don't necessarily, we don't necessarily tie directly our mental health into like the things that we're doing But I definitely can tell that there have been episodes where maybe my mental health wasn't in the best place. And it directly correlated with struggles that I was having at work at home, whatever
But I definitely can tell that there have been episodes where maybe my mental health wasn't in the best place. And it directly correlated with struggles that I was having at work at home, whatever And just tying my productivity into my mental, whatever made me stop and go, oh, it's almost like if I don't feel good, I don't perform well. Yeah, I think in both cases, it's, it's descriptive and not prescriptive. Yeah. So I know to that, de-script was the app that I was thinking of

So as soon as you said it, I was like, ah, that's it. But I did want to ask kind of in kind of combining those veins, you've been on the internet through all of it I think you've gone through every, you know, as I'm not going to, I'm not going to label you as any generation, but you've gone through all of the internet, millennial traumas that have happened. And it seems like it doesn't prevent your output of Brett things

You know, the work stuff I don't know too much about, but in terms of like BrettTurbshtra.com, one avid, avid reader, but I see the list of active projects like continuing to increase What is there, is there a secret? Is there a tip to working through the, maybe the mental downs that you use? Well, first of all, I've been on the internet since before the web. Like I go way back to like, what was they called? PhytoNet, old BBS's Gofer
What is there, is there a secret? Is there a tip to working through the, maybe the mental downs that you use? Well, first of all, I've been on the internet since before the web. Like I go way back to like, what was they called? PhytoNet, old BBS's Gofer Gofer was the first time I read the anarchist cookbook was on Gofer. Anyway, being productive, I don't necessarily know how to work through like being bipolar. When I'm depressed, there's no like shaking that off
Gofer was the first time I read the anarchist cookbook was on Gofer. Anyway, being productive, I don't necessarily know how to work through like being bipolar. When I'm depressed, there's no like shaking that off There's no like, oh man, if I could just get myself started on something I could do it. There's, it's often insurmountable. I have found things like taking a shower and going for a walk and getting myself on some kind of schedule can help help me at least get through a day of work
There's no like, oh man, if I could just get myself started on something I could do it. There's, it's often insurmountable. I have found things like taking a shower and going for a walk and getting myself on some kind of schedule can help help me at least get through a day of work But like, after work, I'm done. I'm not working on personal projects. And then when I'm manic, I overdo it. And I publish things that I'll end up having to support for years, even though it was really just a weekend of brainstorm. But I've been stable for a long time now

And I just, I just, the nice thing about like personal projects is no one's telling me what to do. And if I get bored working on something, I usually have an idea what else I want to work on And the nice thing about ADHD is tons of ideas, but then the ability to hyper focus on something that's actually interesting.

And the nice thing about ADHD is tons of ideas, but then the ability to hyper focus on something that's actually interesting. And I get a major dopamine from like solving problems from getting a rejects to work perfectly Like this morning, I wrote an algorithm for doing best matching that didn't require, didn't rely on string distance, like Levinstein, that actually had a more curated approach to best string matching
Like this morning, I wrote an algorithm for doing best matching that didn't require, didn't rely on string distance, like Levinstein, that actually had a more curated approach to best string matching And it's like, it's a high, like when you get it to work, when you're running through your spec tests and it, everything's just like green. And you're like, I saw that I did it
And it's like, it's a high, like when you get it to work, when you're running through your spec tests and it, everything's just like green. And you're like, I saw that I did it And like for me, as an ADHD person who, especially like everyone seeks out dopamine to some extent, but for me, I just, I follow the dopamine. I am always in search of the next dopamine hit. And fortunately, I get those dopamine hits from being productive, from creating and solving problems
And like for me, as an ADHD person who, especially like everyone seeks out dopamine to some extent, but for me, I just, I follow the dopamine. I am always in search of the next dopamine hit. And fortunately, I get those dopamine hits from being productive, from creating and solving problems And it's not, it's not a secret. I can pass on to just anybody, I guess. Yeah.

And it's not, it's not a secret. I can pass on to just anybody, I guess. Yeah. Well, I think it's interesting in that, you know, one of the things that I tend to notice is when it's time for me to change a job, which apparently I've gotten flack for Conduit has survived three, three different jobs. And condo, it's only like, I think not even three years old. We started at the end of one job. So it was okay. But I tend to start working more on personal projects when I'm maybe like unfulfilled at work
Conduit has survived three, three different jobs. And condo, it's only like, I think not even three years old. We started at the end of one job. So it was okay. But I tend to start working more on personal projects when I'm maybe like unfulfilled at work And this is, this is one of those things that I've been trying to counteract or figure out for myself of like, at some point I'm going to have to do, I'm going to have to treat my personal projects almost as work where you have to do them even when you're not really feeling it
And this is, this is one of those things that I've been trying to counteract or figure out for myself of like, at some point I'm going to have to do, I'm going to have to treat my personal projects almost as work where you have to do them even when you're not really feeling it And some of that is just purely like, I have Python packages that I maintain that I would like for people to actually use. But a part of people using them is I need to make sure that they stay up to date. I need to make sure that, you know, critical bugs are fixed
And some of that is just purely like, I have Python packages that I maintain that I would like for people to actually use. But a part of people using them is I need to make sure that they stay up to date. I need to make sure that, you know, critical bugs are fixed There's also the side of this that now my biggest project of like of my entire life other than like getting married, having kids and all that stuff is this nonprofit that I started
There's also the side of this that now my biggest project of like of my entire life other than like getting married, having kids and all that stuff is this nonprofit that I started And there are so many times where the problem isn't necessarily right, right code and whatever language it is figure out how to send money to a country where your bank will not send money. And you've kind of already promised that you would do this
And there are so many times where the problem isn't necessarily right, right code and whatever language it is figure out how to send money to a country where your bank will not send money. And you've kind of already promised that you would do this So now like, fulfill the promise or talk to people who don't know about tech about your little tech community and why they should give you tens of thousands of dollars. And like, that is a, that is a thing that I have tried to do the developer advocate thing of just being on for
So now like, fulfill the promise or talk to people who don't know about tech about your little tech community and why they should give you tens of thousands of dollars. And like, that is a, that is a thing that I have tried to do the developer advocate thing of just being on for And it is such a struggle. Like if I'm, if I'm talking about work, I can be fake excited about a thing for work because it's my job to be fake excited about a thing for work. Yeah. And sometimes if there's authenticity in there, even better. But at the same time, like I want to be excited for it
And it is such a struggle. Like if I'm, if I'm talking about work, I can be fake excited about a thing for work because it's my job to be fake excited about a thing for work. Yeah. And sometimes if there's authenticity in there, even better. But at the same time, like I want to be excited for it If for my side projects, I want to be excited. But to be honest, talking to someone who's just like, yeah, yeah, how do I get the I points by writing you a check? Like, it becomes really hard to muster excitement up for those kinds of conversations. Sure. Yeah
If for my side projects, I want to be excited. But to be honest, talking to someone who's just like, yeah, yeah, how do I get the I points by writing you a check? Like, it becomes really hard to muster excitement up for those kinds of conversations. Sure. Yeah Sure. Yeah. Like for me, like, I've published enough projects that I get emails will say a few times a week from people that have like dug up one of my old projects and run into a bug. And it will like refocus me. And I'll be like, Oh, we got to solve this. I'll dig this old project back up
Sure. Yeah. Like for me, like, I've published enough projects that I get emails will say a few times a week from people that have like dug up one of my old projects and run into a bug. And it will like refocus me. And I'll be like, Oh, we got to solve this. I'll dig this old project back up And the next thing I know, I've spent a week like adding new features and reviving a project from, you know, three years ago. And so like customer support emails keep it a to your point, they make it like a job. You know, even if it's not for a paid application, it feels like work
And the next thing I know, I've spent a week like adding new features and reviving a project from, you know, three years ago. And so like customer support emails keep it a to your point, they make it like a job. You know, even if it's not for a paid application, it feels like work It feels like I've been assigned a task, but it's a task related to something I'm definitely interested in because I wrote it. And that is that that keeps me going. And also gives me lots of new ideas. So like just interaction with the community. I kind of see that as like they're all my manager
It feels like I've been assigned a task, but it's a task related to something I'm definitely interested in because I wrote it. And that is that that keeps me going. And also gives me lots of new ideas. So like just interaction with the community. I kind of see that as like they're all my manager Yeah. I like that. I feel like I had a second point there, but I lost it. That's okay. I think the one just that the community is a manager
Yeah. I like that. I feel like I had a second point there, but I lost it. That's okay. I think the one just that the community is a manager I mean, for us where, you know, a part of what we're doing and maybe a little less with what you're doing where like you have you have applications that are you need to pay to use these applications to some effect or you need to, you know, get a subscription to set up or something that's generating revenue
I mean, for us where, you know, a part of what we're doing and maybe a little less with what you're doing where like you have you have applications that are you need to pay to use these applications to some effect or you need to, you know, get a subscription to set up or something that's generating revenue You have so many other projects like one of my personal favorites, Bunch, that is very much like, I feel like I see it in like fits and starts. Like sometimes it'll sometimes I'll be like, hey, I'm trying to do this thing and it doesn't work. And you're like, oh, it should make that easier
You have so many other projects like one of my personal favorites, Bunch, that is very much like, I feel like I see it in like fits and starts. Like sometimes it'll sometimes I'll be like, hey, I'm trying to do this thing and it doesn't work. And you're like, oh, it should make that easier And then all of a sudden it's easier. And then there are like five other updates that come out because of that. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I mean. Like I'll get into, I'll like dig out the code and be like, oh, you know what this could do. And then I'm like adding new features
And then all of a sudden it's easier. And then there are like five other updates that come out because of that. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I mean. Like I'll get into, I'll like dig out the code and be like, oh, you know what this could do. And then I'm like adding new features But back to what you were saying, I do not think I would be capable of doing something like running a nonprofit. I just, that is really impressive to me that you do that. I just don't think that's in my skill set, that kind of administer administration that that would take
But back to what you were saying, I do not think I would be capable of doing something like running a nonprofit. I just, that is really impressive to me that you do that. I just don't think that's in my skill set, that kind of administer administration that that would take I mean, if I'm being honest, I would, I would say I don't think I'm fully the best person to running a nonprofit. Like we talk about this in some ways of like, you have, it's like when you have a CEO who's like a tech, like a tech founder. And like they really want to just play with a tech
I mean, if I'm being honest, I would, I would say I don't think I'm fully the best person to running a nonprofit. Like we talk about this in some ways of like, you have, it's like when you have a CEO who's like a tech, like a tech founder. And like they really want to just play with a tech I think like the seat, the old CEO of Evernote was like that where, oh yeah, Bill Lieben. Yeah, like he cared more about like the technical aspects of the product than like running the company. And that caused problems
I think like the seat, the old CEO of Evernote was like that where, oh yeah, Bill Lieben. Yeah, like he cared more about like the technical aspects of the product than like running the company. And that caused problems Like I feel like that is where I am knowingly the difference in that is that I have hundreds of people who are like, you're doing a fantastic job. And I'm like, I genuinely think if we could pay for someone else to do a job, they would do a better job
Like I feel like that is where I am knowingly the difference in that is that I have hundreds of people who are like, you're doing a fantastic job. And I'm like, I genuinely think if we could pay for someone else to do a job, they would do a better job How many people do you think run nonprofits that think they are actually the best person to run a nonprofit? I bet that's rare. I bet there's a lot of imposter syndrome out there. Yeah
How many people do you think run nonprofits that think they are actually the best person to run a nonprofit? I bet that's rare. I bet there's a lot of imposter syndrome out there. Yeah Yeah.

Yeah. Well, I think once I found out that like executive directors are an entire career path that you can like go to college for and do stuff like, I mean, that's a, that's like a whole thing And that's where I'm looking at like our, the way our setup works is we have like kind of a five year plan where we're going to operate under the umbrella of another organization, the Gennome Foundation
And that's where I'm looking at like our, the way our setup works is we have like kind of a five year plan where we're going to operate under the umbrella of another organization, the Gennome Foundation And in five years, we're supposed to come back and look at this and go like, where are we
And in five years, we're supposed to come back and look at this and go like, where are we Where could we be if we were our own nonprofit that had our own autonomy over these things, but also had a lot of the burdens that come with being your own nonprofit, hiring your own lawyers, having your own insurance policies, doing your own banking and stuff
Where could we be if we were our own nonprofit that had our own autonomy over these things, but also had a lot of the burdens that come with being your own nonprofit, hiring your own lawyers, having your own insurance policies, doing your own banking and stuff Like we did do the cheat code, which is Jay, focus on building the dream. And then if there's anything that's quote-unquote boring, like send an email to them and they take care of it
Like we did do the cheat code, which is Jay, focus on building the dream. And then if there's anything that's quote-unquote boring, like send an email to them and they take care of it And that's like, that's the secret is that we're a nonprofit where a lot of the nonprofit things are handled by the actual nonprofit.

You and Christina both always amaze me with the sheer amount of knowledge that you have when it comes to your disciplines, but also with like culture, what's happening, not necessarily like in popular culture, but what's happening around you Also, it probably doesn't help that you're both like you've both been writers for like news publications and stuff. So maybe there's like a lesson that comes into that. I also did have a joke for you. I did hear about the thing that happened with the unofficial Apple web blog
Also, it probably doesn't help that you're both like you've both been writers for like news publications and stuff. So maybe there's like a lesson that comes into that. I also did have a joke for you. I did hear about the thing that happened with the unofficial Apple web blog And in my mind, I was like someone should like brute force that that way you could hack to which that similar joke actually was what did did make the round. So I thought I was I thought I was unique there
And in my mind, I was like someone should like brute force that that way you could hack to which that similar joke actually was what did did make the round.

But yeah, like how do you how do you balance? And I mean, I guess these are like the questions everyone wants to know How do you do all these things and yet still have time for a social life or have time to read blogs or study up on new tech things or new new new happenings in tech? Like how do you figure out that balance
How do you do all these things and yet still have time for a social life or have time to read blogs or study up on new tech things or new new new happenings in tech? Like how do you figure out that balance Well, I guess like I have a kind of morning ritual that involves a playing New York Times word games

I limit my news intake to that kind of morning half hour. And otherwise by mental health can seriously deteriorate, especially with political news, but even with just like the the kind of information overload of of keeping up with things in general And then the rest of it just kind of filters into me.

Well, don't worry, we don't have three hours. So we'll do it in a quick hurry But there is another part of the show that you do on over tired called Grap to just I can't say Grapitude. There we go. First of all, tell people what Grapitude is. Oh man. So it's basically our favorite software of the week. Each one of us picks usually an indie developer app. And we discuss
But there is another part of the show that you do on over tired called Grap to just I can't say Grapitude. There we go. First of all, tell people what Grapitude is. Oh man. So it's basically our favorite software of the week. Each one of us picks usually an indie developer app. And we discuss And we discuss.

And I jokingly said Grapitude, which is a portmanteau of application and gratitude. And I hated it
And we discuss. And we were kind of it was another thing that we were naturally doing. And then we decided to make another corner out of it. And I jokingly said Grapitude, which is a portmanteau of application and gratitude. And I hated it And I hated it. I was like, absolutely, what we should not call it is Grapitude. And that became the name. And we use it enough that the Descript actually understands the word now and properly transcribes it for me. But yeah, it's our pick of the week. A lot of shows do that kind of thing
And I hated it. I was like, absolutely, what we should not call it is Grapitude. And that became the name. And we use it enough that the Descript actually understands the word now and properly transcribes it for me. But yeah, it's our pick of the week. A lot of shows do that kind of thing So we're just we're just keeping up. What are like the biggest things that you look for when you're like, oh, this is this is a Grapitude level app. If it's in my doc when the show starts and it has been in my doc most of the week, then it's worth talking about
So we're just we're just keeping up. What are like the biggest things that you look for when you're like, oh, this is this is a Grapitude level app. If it's in my doc when the show starts and it has been in my doc most of the week, then it's worth talking about And every once in a while, like it's sometimes it's just something new that I discovered that week that I thought was noteworthy, like someone doing something really cool with with existing or new technologies
And every once in a while, like it's sometimes it's just something new that I discovered that week that I thought was noteworthy, like someone doing something really cool with with existing or new technologies Or even sometimes the Grapitude Pick is a major update to one of our favorite apps that we've already talked about. But like kaleidoscope 5 was the pick last week for Christina. And I think we've talked about that at least two times before that
Or even sometimes the Grapitude Pick is a major update to one of our favorite apps that we've already talked about. But like kaleidoscope 5 was the pick last week for Christina. And I think we've talked about that at least two times before that But they came out with a cool update and it became a pick. So if I'm desperate and I cannot figure out what to talk about, I load up. What's the why am I blanking on? Hold on. Pudaspot. A load of Pudaspot. And I have a safe search that shows me my most used apps
But they came out with a cool update and it became a pick. So if I'm desperate and I cannot figure out what to talk about, I load up. What's the why am I blanking on? Hold on. Pudaspot. A load of Pudaspot. And I have a safe search that shows me my most used apps And I'll just I'll just filter down the list. What I haven't done yet, Christina was supposed to put together a website that kept track of our Grapitude picks. And she never has
And I'll just I'll just filter down the list. What I haven't done yet, Christina was supposed to put together a website that kept track of our Grapitude picks. And she never has And she never has. But what I wanted was to build an API that I could easily check my list of most used apps against apps we've already talked about and filter it down to apps we haven't talked about yet. That's yeah, no, that tracks
And she never has. But what I wanted was to build an API that I could easily check my list of most used apps against apps we've already talked about and filter it down to apps we haven't talked about yet. That's yeah, no, that tracks That's like a that's like a bread turps for thing easily, easily picture there. Which actually I was I was going to ask the second you mentioned who to spot like most of your app ideas that you've created come from these like I'm doing this thing
That's like a that's like a bread turps for thing easily, easily picture there. Which actually I was I was going to ask the second you mentioned who to spot like most of your app ideas that you've created come from these like I'm doing this thing And now the thing is you know now I've built this thing and then that thing evolves into its own app. Like what first of all like how did you even begin to think about the process of I'm going to use who to spot to figure out the most open to applications or like how does that work
And now the thing is you know now I've built this thing and then that thing evolves into its own app. Like what first of all like how did you even begin to think about the process of I'm going to use who to spot to figure out the most open to applications or like how does that work And then what's stopping that from becoming the next Brett Terpster project like what's preventing that from happening. Well, it actually I actually wrote a command line script that uses MD find with not terribly complex predicate to sort to find and sort by last opened in your applications folder
And then what's stopping that from becoming the next Brett Terpster project like what's preventing that from happening. Well, it actually I actually wrote a command line script that uses MD find with not terribly complex predicate to sort to find and sort by last opened in your applications folder And that will give me an ordered list of what I've opened in order. And I should who to spot can't actually tell me how many times I've opened an app. Okay. And it can't tell me how long an app was running. So if I were to take this on as a personal project. Oh, you know what could though
And that will give me an ordered list of what I've opened in order. And I should who to spot can't actually tell me how many times I've opened an app. Okay. And it can't tell me how long an app was running. So if I were to take this on as a personal project. Oh, you know what could though This is time. This is how it begins. Timing timing timing can do it. And timing can output JSON reports. So I could easily create an automation that used timing to tell me what apps were running the long or were focused on my system for the longest period of time. Yep
This is time. This is how it begins. Timing timing timing can do it. And timing can output JSON reports. So I could easily create an automation that used timing to tell me what apps were running the long or were focused on my system for the longest period of time. Yep Yep. That sounds like a Brett Terpster project. I would say I'm sorry, but I want to say you. Yep. Yep. Sounds like fun. Oh, man. Well, that I always like to do these types of interviews. But I haven't done an interview in forever, which is weird because I used to just do an interview show

But I always want to ask the same question as we as we wrap up. And that is what is what is the question that you wish I would have asked you? Oh, man. So I have like a real so when I'm focused, it's very much a hyper focused one track mind So if you had asked me anything about how is it, I could talk for an hour.
