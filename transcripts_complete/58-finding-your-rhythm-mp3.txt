From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that condue it after dark. This episode is brought to you by Micro.blog and Electric. I'm Kathy and with me is a friend who is even later in this time zone today and only half of the reason that we are recording this so late. Jay Miller. Hey Jay. It may be late, but we're always on time. Heck yeah. We are wizards. Thank you very much. Gandalf wizards, not hairy wizards. I prefer to be a time lord, but you know, we'll go with that. It's fine. I'd rather be a nice and I so it's all good. Anyways, this week in the discord, it has been all chaos all the time because it is the week of the podcast a thon, which means as we record this in 12 hours, I will be leaving my house to get on a plane to fly to Memphis to then spend 12 hours all day performing for you on Friday to raise money for the kids. It's for the kids. Jay, I need you to talk real quick so that I can pull up this stuff for St. Jude. So do your thing. You know, when I heard that Kathy was going to be on the podcast, the thon team in person, I immediately booked a trip to Tennessee as well. Unfortunately, I booked it to East Tennessee because geography be hard. No, no, no, no. I would as much as I would have loved to somehow like crash to the after party that of the podcast, the thon, which I'm guessing the after party is everyone being like, great work now. Everybody go to your hotels and go to sleep. Crashing. I'd be like, party, they'd be like, get out. So but I am looking forward to part of the podcast, the thon being, you know, the entertainment that keeps me awake as I fight traffic and head to visit my my relatives in East Tennessee, which is very, very far from West Tennessee, because people don't realize Tennessee is one of the widest, widest with a D. Wow. All right. Moving on. September is childhood cancer awareness month. And since our first relay FM switch on for St. Jude campaign in 2019, we've now raised over two point five million dollars as a community, which means we hit our first goal for twenty twenty three before the podcast, the thon even. But we're not stopping there because St. Jude won't stop their lifesaving work until no child dies from cancer. With your support, we'll be one step closer to that day. One cure closer, one child closer. St. Jude is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, but its work has a global impact. St. Jude has treated children from all 50 states of the United States and from all around the world. About 90 percent of children with cancer live in low and middle income countries. That's absolutely unacceptable to St. Jude. They launched St. Jude Global to ensure that every child with cancer and other catastrophic diseases has access to quality care and treatment no matter where they live. St. Jude Global shares knowledge, technology and expertise with health care institutions, researchers and fundraisers across the world to improve survival rates in their home countries. For example, they train the doctors and researchers of tomorrow, host conferences and share skills and help nonprofit foundations raise awareness and build sustainable sources of revenue to support children in their countries with cancer and other blood disorders. Today, St. Jude collaborates with more than 280 partners in St. Jude Global, representing more than 70 countries and growing. That's how far the reach of this work is. Check out how St. Jude Global partnerships help children in countries like Jordan, Lebanon and the Philippines on St. Jude dot org slash inspire. We are so incredibly grateful for the generosity of our community over the last five years, and we would love your support again this year to support the life saving mission of St. Jude. The fifth annual podcast is fast approaching. When this show comes out, it will be tomorrow live on Friday, September 22nd from 12 p.m. to 12 a.m. Eastern from noon to midnight. Yes, that's 12 hours this year. But we need your help to raise as much money as possible for St. Jude before that day, too. And after as well, donors who make an individual gift of six dollars or more will receive a digital bundle of Relay FM, wallpapers and screensavers. Last year, our screensavers sent shockwaves throughout the Relay FM switch on the community. So don't miss out. Also, donors who make an individual gift of one hundred dollars or more will receive our twenty twenty three sticker pack featuring all new designs. When you donate this year, please check the blue search employer button on the donation summary page to check if your employer offers a matching gift program. If they do, you'll get an email with details on how to have their match credited to our campaign total. And if you want to get even more hands on, you can start your own fundraising campaign to help us reach our goals while earning exclusive Relay FM switch on merch. Fundraisers who raise at least one dollar will receive a twenty twenty three face off edition of the Relay FM for St. Jude challenge coin and fundraisers raising two hundred and fifty dollars or more will also receive this year's incredible desk mat.

St. Jude won't stop until no child dies from cancer. With your support, we'll be one step closer to that day. One cure closer, one child closer this month and every month. This month and every month, let's cure childhood cancer together. Oh, thanks, Ramon. It's so sweet. And. Sorry, we recently conducted our Baldur's Gate three live stream, which we talked a lot about in last week's co-working because there was there was a lot of things that were happening. But like, oh, my goodness, just the the overall Baldur's Gate, and it's so that, oh, my gosh, it was that was bananas. It was so much fun. I think we both were wiped like at least once. They had to to use all of our scrolls of of Revenity. Um, Gail still is the worst. I always hated Gail in Hunger Games, so it was time to. Yeah, we needed to be gone and clearly we did fine without him. Yeah. Hashtag never Gail. So, yeah, if you missed that, I'm sorry. I think the VOD is available somewhere. You're going to have to look for it. It's too late for me to come up with logical. Links to things. If OK, if it's late night, show notes are optional. Or may not be something in the notes. Hopefully, when this comes out in two days from today, we will have rested a little bit because that will be before the podcast of on. But that basically what we're saying is that our co-working sessions are a lot of fun, even when we're not planning our Baldur's Gate situation. Or just playing ball. Just playing ball. Yeah. Oh, man. I think we also talked about new Apple equipment, Kathy. Was there any Apple equipment stuff? Oh, yeah, we we we watched kind of watched the iPhone Apple watch stream with our our buddy Douglas was the only friend there, which is totally fine. It was great because we got we got we got stuff done, which is how we need to watch the cringiest of sustainability videos. I'm sorry. That was like it was so that was really bad. I mean. I this OK, this isn't an Apple podcast. We're allowed to talk. Listen, it's not trash. It's a respectful disagreement or like an understanding. They needed to fill time. They it was trash. It was it was a choice. It was a choice. I love almost all that Octavia Spencer does. And before that event, I loved all the Octavia. I know I was like, wow. And I think I think if it hadn't been in the middle of a of an Apple keynote, I would have frickin loved it. But it was in the middle of that and it was it was a choice. But if you want to join, no, this is your thing. You read it. Yeah. If you want to hear opinions like this on a regular basis, because our co-working sessions, we are we are unprofessional as expletive, like it is it is completely off the rails. We're playing music. We're hanging out. People are showing stains, which if you were there, you would know what that actually is, because it's pretty cool. People are being productive and unproductive and quasi productive and semi productive. They're dogs. Yep. If you want, if that sounds like a great place to work, then, yeah, visit, I'm a superconductor dot com and become a member today. That's letter I, letter M, letter A, superconductor dot com. Become a member and caveat, of course, during September, we'd like to tell people if you have to make the decision of supporting St. Jude or supporting conduit, you 100 percent support St. Jude 10 out of 10 times. And then just catch us 10 out of 10. Just catch us in October when we're back on the scene. And exactly. So, yeah, I'm a superconductor dot com. Become a member only after you've donated to St. Jude. True. All right. It's time for our connection checks. Zap. How do you do, Jay? I would prefer if you went first, because I have storytime. OK, I also have storytime, but I have a big green checkmark on my connection check because finalize my system is a go. I am officially an OmniFocus user again for realsies this time. I don't know. Did you uninstall to do it? I did, actually. What? Yes. Wow. And I turned off the email reminders like something about the combination between Rosemary's Very Good Book that I definitely know the name of and I'm not. Oh, my goodness. You know how late it is, Kathy. I literally typed in Rosemary's Very Good Book. Oh, my gosh, that's amazing. Build your OmniFocus workflow is what it's called with Ryan Dotson as well. Between that and then I found a YouTube channel that I definitely know the name of him. That also the way that she uses OmniFocus is very similar to the way that my brain works. So I've been able to build this out in a way that makes a lot more sense for my brain, which is the point of productivity systems. So with the exception, OK, even though it's only been working technically for a week because I then got sick. And that means that it's been a little bit less of productivity based. But Kendra's productivity is the YouTube channel that it's called. And but the the folder ring and task projects, perspectives, tags, this whole situation will go over it when we when we get to a systems check. But it has already saved my butt when I've been sick. So something's working right, because if I can get stuff done that needs to happen while I'm sick, you know that the system is good. So I can't wait to see how this works when I'm healthy and I'm not not home, not not home when I'm oh, when I back home. That's the words that I was trying to say. Yep. When I back home. Hello. Late night, Jay here. I just want to go to the about page of the Build Your OmniFocus workflow book. Yeah, the the about section of that website. Rosemary is like day zero starting OmniFocus. So much hope. Ryan is like six years in. This is my life now. It's like the Castaway. Yes. Amazing. We love both of them. They're both absolutely amazing. I love them. I appreciate them very much. So I yeah, just just I didn't I didn't. It was bad. I worked a lot. I I've been stressing as I've been getting kind of praised for work. That seems really, really like, oh, attention on Jay. This is great. Like this is really, really good. And because of that, a lot of the time that I would have spent just hanging out with my kiddo was spent like hanging out with my kiddo with a laptop in my lap, trying to actually get the work done. I have never felt like an absentee parent more up until yesterday, where I absolutely felt like an absentee parent more because I went to drop off my child because I had to go to an event. And the one thing that I said in front of her teacher Oh, no, was like, don't be worried. Don't worry. I will be home to put you to bed. Yeah. 1030 rolled around and it was like, oh, like the the walk of of parental shame in that my child is already asleep. To which, as I was dropping her off this morning to go back to the event that I had to go to of her still being upset and me saying, don't worry, I will be home before dinner. Oh, no, Jay. And as she shouted as loud as possible, you said that yesterday. Oh, no. So I am publicly telling the world, yes, this this was a very low moment in parenting for me. I did try to redeem myself. I left the event early and surprised my daughter by picking her up from school today, to which she wasn't as excited about this as I was. She was like, hey, you're supposed to be working. And I was like, but I did I made I did this for you. And she was just like, yeah, no, that that you're not off the hook with this. So let me tell you a secret. Your kids will always like they will rail you. And it doesn't matter what you do. They will be there to like cause problems. Yeah. Yeah. So it was it was absolutely one of these moments of like I know that I did bad and I have zero excuses. I refuse to let work be an excuse for how how poor I was to to my poor child there. So, yeah, yep, that's that that's me. Yeah. Well, how did our conductors do better than me? I'll tell you that our identical twin of the show, Aaron, said green checkmark implemented a little skeleton enemy in my game. Sorry, I haven't built a unicorn or a KJNPC yet prepared. I will. I just want to throw out there, if you do make a KJNPC, that that NPC can be so annoying and just talk about like how it's so excited to finally be in the game. Yes. Same. Our pathologist of the show, Laura, says connection check Greenheart. I did well sticking more or less mostly more with a single system over the last two weeks, mostly analog bullet journal for daily work with Google Calendar and Apple Reminder support. Fan fricking task. Well done, Kathy. I have to tell you, I my two week system stuff, I ran out and I've tried to like remake them on my own. It's not the same. I am almost for sure buying a Hobanichi for next year. Oh, well, I have a really pretty one that I also bought, but we can talk about later. Our tire advocate of the show, Chinta, says Green Circle, I managed to clear my desk and surrounding area. Pity I didn't manage to do it in time for desk day, but I'll still count it as a win. That's OK. That's OK. Desk day is optional. Yes, definitely. Air the hem. The Canadian our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica, says connection check Greenheart. The deep clean went well, and I am well on the way to being comfortable that I've asked for that level of help. I am so flipping proud of you, Erica. You are doing amazing. Our soprano of the show, Debo, says Greenheart got started on the knit scarf and making my mom for Christmas. Hopefully she doesn't listen to the show, but you should totally get her to listen to the show. The next episode. Yes, not this one. And yeah, not this one. Also, as a bonus, also started a knit hat for my dad. Also should be listening to the show. But again, not skip this one. Right. Our fish bear of this show, fishy Kai connection check green turtle. I wanted to get at least two house projects done. No, Jay, I don't have only two house projects. Two is a drop in the bucket. And I did about one point eight, which rounds up to two, which means green. Heck, yeah. Absolutely. I love it. So good. So good. Our shark of the show, one pair of shoes says Greenheart connection this past four and I was complete and file six research progress projects I was able to complete and file four of them. Another one failed, but I think I have the problem fixed. And the sixth one needs samples before I can perform the study. I'll take the wins as I can get them. Side note used random dot org for doing sample randomizations in the project. Oh, random dot org sounds fun. We bring the random to you. I personally like to use Faker for a lot of stuff, but we can we can talk about that in a different. Our panda of the show, James connection check six colors heart because a mix of so many colors. I did successfully survive the Apple event and managed barely after that sustainability skit. I did manage to ship what I think are reasonable updates to all my apps, not to mention finish off a certain screensaver. But while I have technically survived being on my own for two weeks, the work stress also led to so many poor life decisions. I'm proud of you. You did survive. And I'm excited for you to no longer be a bachelor in your house. So someone can hopefully help you take better care of yourself. I got those updates and can confirm. Yeah, they're they're good. Good updates. Yeah. Mountain dweller of the show, looking low. Greenheart, the only bad part of solo dadding was now I want to quit my job and be a full time stay at home dad. I hope Jay's time. Listen here, Logang. OK, first you show me up on my own podcast and then and then you have the gall to be like, like, oh, yeah, best dad ever. Amazing dad experiences. I hope Jay had a fraction of the wonderful grace of hanging out with his child. Meanwhile, I'm over here barely remembering to feed myself, let alone the little one. She's well and fine. Don't call the authorities on me. OK, soup dad, train enthusiast of the show, Rails, the connection check red circle. It's been two weeks already. Yikes. I've not done a thing, but that's OK. I guess I had an accidental free connection to relax. I do need to get to applying to more jobs. Our Oracle show, so says Green Apple Research Report completed just in time for Conduit. We can't talk about this beforehand. I really hope that so finished it at about 10 o'clock Eastern time, because if that pressure was put on for a show that got recorded about 10 hours later than that usually does, I feel really bad. Yeah, yeah. This episode of Conduit is brought to you by Micro.Blog. Blogging is still the easiest way to share stuff on the web, and Micro.Blog is the easiest way to blog. Personal blogging is making a comeback thanks to all the disruption in social media, like we were discussing in our pre-show. So if you have always wanted to build your own place on the Internet to keep and share the stuff you love, Micro.Blog is for you. Micro.Blog is the blog you will actually use because we've made it so easy to write short or long blog posts, share photos, keep a log of the books you read and even create your own podcast. But more than a place to post your stuff, it's also a friendly community of people with a wide range of interests who share and comment via Micro.Blog social timeline, which is managed by humans, not bots. It's a social network you can feel good about. And because Micro.Blog is open, you can use your own domain name, cross post to Twitter or X, Tumblr and Mastodon. You can also follow and be followed by Mastodon users directly with conversations threading across both Micro.Blog and Mastodon. And finally, you could share your RSS feed so anyone can follow you. In our pre-show, Jay, you talked about wanting to throw this over here. What you want to say? So, yeah, I I would implore people to consider becoming a superconductor, not only because I get paid when you do this. Let's be honest, that's part of it, but also because we have very, very candid and open discussions. One of them was I made the decision after the. Podcasting encouragement of a few others who had also made that decision to try to try to make the dedicated decision to leave Twitter slash X. And I have struggled with it significantly due to the lack of of people that I was genuinely interested in engaging with on the other service. But one thing I can definitely say, the reason why Micro.Blog has been a part of my social media experience for a few years at this point is that the human beings on Micro.Blog are genuinely amazing individuals. And this isn't done with, you know, just a website, you know, put together where people are allowed to to just do whatever they want. The people behind the scenes of Micro.Blog genuinely care about their service. It is a it is a well moderated service that allows people to share themselves and do it in a way that allows them to feel safe from harassment and feel as if they belong. Even when I don't post for like days, weeks and at some points, even months, I come back and it's the same warm and absolutely cared for community. That I miss and I always wind up thinking to myself, why don't I just spend more time here? And I really should. And you should too. Micro.Blog hosting starts at five dollars per month. Head over to Micro.Blog and sign up for a 30 day free trial. Use the coupon code relay and you'll get a special deal with your standard subscription. You'll get a premium account at no extra charge.

Micro.Blog and code relay are thanks to Micro.Blog for their support of this show and all of Relay FM. And at the end of every sponsor read, Kathy, at the end of every sponsor read, I try to say thank you in a different language. Today, we are doing. Oh, I see what happened here. Hold on one second. We are doing Galician, which, yeah, we're going to try this. Grazas. So, Jay, when we were discussing what to talk about on this show, you said, I have a quirky topic idea. Finding rhythm, it's flow, but with style, to which I replied, am I too white to understand what that means? Not at all, Kathy. OK, good. Because, yeah, I read and I don't know if it was because I'm tired getting over being sick or what. But yeah, I read that and I didn't quite understand what you mean. So please discuss to my brain what your topic is. So yesterday I as I mentioned, I went to this event and completely shirked my responsibilities as a loving father. But in the event, I had an idea of I was there to be in the audience. I wasn't there to participate. But with most developer events, there's usually an opportunity for people to do a small presentation, usually like five minutes. And Kathy, have you ever heard of what's called an ignite talk? Is that where you set fire to things? To the rain, yes. No, that's that's not. However, here's the idea. You've given PowerPoint presentations before, correct? Mm hmm. OK. Most importantly, I did one with a group of friends where we each brought a five minute PowerPoint that we then had to give to our friends on a name topic. And no, sorry. Yeah, it was five minutes. And for every like 30 seconds, we went over the five minute. We had to take a drink. It was very good. This is this is perfect. So you understand the challenge of creating a talk that is five minutes. Yes. So now imagine that. But being told that you have to have 20 slides for your five minute talk. Wow. I mean, so I did mine on fountain pens. Oh, good topic. Yeah, it was great. But I did not have that many slides. You know, you just made all of our feedback. Kathy, we want to see the slideshow. No, you do not, because it was terrible. I made it literally 10 minutes before I had to go on. So it was awful. Absolutely awful. We're not you're not seeing it. So so, yeah, 20 slides. Now imagine that the slides auto progressed every 15 seconds. Oh, that's like an extra layer of difficulty. I love it. So this is an ignite talk. It is a five minute, a five minute presentation, 20 slides and the slides transition every 15 seconds. There is one 15 second slide that you don't get. That is enough time for you to basically grab the mic and make your way up to the stage as it's happening. I was the second to last ignite talk, and I had seen ignite talks given before, but I had never given one myself, which was why I wanted to do such. And the I did really well. It's not like a pat in my back moment. Like I I sincerely feel like I did a great job at doing this. I would believe that you are very good at giving talks because, you know, that's part of your job. Yeah, that's including with actual professional slides and like fancy slides. So I feel like you would slide into that. Oh, geez. Anyway, I did great. The person after me was a business founder that wanted to take five minutes to promote their company and what they do. Not a professional person that gets on stage and deals with things. So there was some struggling there during my talk because no one was touching the computer because the slides were audit, you know, auto transitioned. The screen went to sleep and and without a beat, I continued my presentation while someone walked over and reopened the the presentation. And I was still on time with the slides. This was this was like the I am a baller moment. You are a baller. That's amazing. And after the talk, someone came up to me and was like, how did you do that? It was like your talk was good. It was entertaining. People were laughing. People were excited. People were like intrigued with what you were doing. And when things went wrong outside of your control, you didn't miss a beat. How did you do it? And I told them it was all about the rhythm because that 15 seconds that I had to get onto the stage and do something, I was in my head counting to get an internal beat to how long it would take before each slide changed. And once I had that, I knew that I could just keep going and just do my thing and be, you know, within a second of when the slides were going to change. And the reason I was thinking about this, Kathy, is this was something that is super simple, but comes from a background of just loving music and, you know, having some background in music and understanding of that. Like, you know, as a musician, you're doing things, but you're also trying to to keep the beat in your head or listen to the drummer as they're doing their thing and just being able to go with it. And I wanted to know, Kathy, in the world of productivity, there are a lot of times when things mess up, when things don't look right or when you just have an opportunity to just look like a straight up G. Kathy, what is your rhythm moment? Oh, gosh. I think. I have had, OK. I wish I had, you know, let me let me let me bring my words together this moment right now. Ha ha. I'm just kidding. There's something this type of rhythm thing. I don't I don't have the same rhythm as you. Music is not a deep part of my life. I never really listened to a lot of music growing up. It was only in when I rode a bus that I had my walk in that I listened to the radio. Like music is involved, but it's not like deeply, deeply part of my life. But something that is a part of my life is listening to people when they're kind of explaining where they're they're finding pain points in their business. And I know this is it's kind of cheesy or whatever. But this is what I've made my business on is listening to what people are saying. Not like what listening to what people. Are saying and in hearing the words around that. So a lot of times the initial consultations that I'm having with my clients or potential clients or future clients or whatever, it's it's a it's a different conversation that we're having than your usual like company one of someone coming and saying, oh, I need help invoicing. It's like, OK, but do you is that really what you need? And, you know, talking to them and learning what takes them a lot of time versus not like takes them so much energy to do versus something that comes innately. Being able to pull that out of them through a series of questions or the conversations that I'm having with them to like just. Almost magically figure out what's going on, which is something that I really like I don't even think about anymore, which is really painful when I'm in a situation with something that I cannot contribute to if I'm watching an event or I'm at a company or a business, you know, as as a. A guest, and I'm I'm watching this lack of efficiency, and I'm just like, oh, my gosh, if I just give me ten minutes, please, to have a conversation with somebody in charge to try and like adjust things, please, please let this happen. But it's not, you know, having to turn that off in my life is is difficult. But I wish I had the ability to do a speech and keep it on time. That's a pretty cool magic trick. No, no, Kathy, I think that truly is like your rhythm moment, because I have been privy to this. I have experienced the like. I don't know what I need, so I just have to. Talk around what I think I need. And this is this is like this is the Henry Ford moment. This is the, you know, we need we need a better horse, you know, versus a car. Like. Your ability to hear, you know, my systems are jacked up. Out of I need someone to send these emails is like truly a gift. And to me, I wanted to bring this up because I feel like there are, you know, this is one of those things that's relatable. Like I part of these events that I go to, you know, there's always, you know, someone that wants to talk to me about like, hey, you know, you're in this industry that's relatively, you know, new in technology. It's kind of mystical, I guess. People think that we're influencers when we're not. People think that we're like super like all star speakers when that's also not true. Like we get the same anxieties that people that, you know, don't speak that often also get. And there is this this moment of. Me me saying things that. You know, I forget them until someone is in front of me asking me those questions. And, you know, I think Christina Warren, who, you know, one of the hosts of Rocket, also my colleague at it for GitHub, which is a company that, you know, is under the whole umbrella of all of us. She actually used to be a coworker. She's referred to this this idea of like being on. And it's like whether you're an introvert or an extrovert, when you are when you're on, it's different. It's like a switch that flips. And we have so many amazing people just in our community that I see this in. You know, we have people who are, you know, good habit, you know, habit setters. That can use those skills to write a book or, you know, complete a really challenging task. You have people who can see beauty in some of the nastiest things on the planet and use that to bring, you know, joy into kind of a gloomier topic. And then you have people who. Genuinely just, you know, know exactly what to say to to just bring joy to the to that moment. And it's so cool to see all of these different like, wow, I'm just seeing a little bit of the rhythm in that person's life. And I just wonder, like how they're using it in their own way. I just wonder, like how they're using it in their day to day. Or do they even know that they're using it or do they know that they have it? Because, I mean, that's the beautiful thing about learning how to dance is everyone can learn how to dance. You just have to find the rhythm inside of you first. Yeah, I think it's this is a good reason, a good thing to to. Why you need friends that maybe not in the same industry as you, but that can understand kind of what. Like how best to vibe with it, shall we say. So being able to recognize the fact that your rhythm and your ability to present with slides is so innate and so honed that you're able to keep that rhythm. My ability to question Rosemary's amazingness to get that automation skills of just like, oh, well, I could just automate this. Boom, done. Like having friends and colleagues that can identify those pieces and be comfortable enough to point that out. I have a friend of mine that I am constantly just. Overwhelmed with her ability to recognize people by their face by they'll be like across the street, a block away, walking away with us, away from us with a baseball hat and a big, you know, fluffy jacket and be like, oh, hey, there's so and so we should message them and see if they want to come get coffee with us. And I'm just like, I could barely tell that was a human, let alone like who that who they were. And I am constantly just like making sure she remembers that this is a magic, like amazing thing to identify. And so I don't know if this is your purpose, but my thought from this episode is to make sure that you are identifying those special features in people that you interact with, I even if it's just a micro interaction, somebody that, you know, I, my almost cousin works like manages one of my favorite pubs around here. And he is so good at handling drunk people like scary good. It's just magic when he's working with them that he he's setting the boundaries and managing them in a way that doesn't make them feel managed. And it's just a beautiful thing to watch. And I make sure to tell him that when I see it. So maybe over this next fortnight, see if you can identify those moments in people and call it out and make sure that they know that they have some rhythm in their life. And help them remember for themselves what that magic is. Yeah, I was hoping that that could be, you know, kind of the obviously I don't think it's going to be our connections because I have a good feeling. I know what Kathy's connection might be. Um, but I, I definitely have this, this feeling of. A lot of folks don't don't realize that what they are doing is, is the rhythm is, you know, again, oh, I'm, I'm dancing. I didn't even realize it. Like, yeah, for someone who grew up around that their entire life, you don't realize that your, your light on your feet and you're dancing and you're doing things. And I, I wanted this to be a wonderful opportunity for people to, you know, do a couple of things. One, take, take a second just to go, yeah, oh, wow, that's actually a pretty interesting trait. I wonder how if I, if I know or I acknowledge that this is something that I'm doing, how do, how do I use that to my benefit in my career or in my day to day or in some of my routines, but then also stopping to see that skill in others and, and just highlight that and just be like, wow, you know, I really admire how you're able to do this thing. It truly is a skill because I didn't think about it until someone stopped and asked me about it. And like, even when it happened, people were like, wow, like great job. And I was like, oh yeah, you know, I, I do this. But then like, it took someone going, how are you able to do this specific thing? And that's when it was like, oh yeah, that was kind of cool actually. And I think that, you know, we, we talk a lot about just the emotional space that you're in to do your best work. And I think that genuinely that moment where you can go, oh, I am kind of awesome. Aren't I? Like, I think that that just brings about a light, a level of like productivity unlocked in that. So I'm, I'm super excited. Kite This episode of conduit is brought to you by electric. When you think of the phrase boss move, you might think of making a bold business decision or maybe giving a great presentation in front of a big crowd. The reality is, I know it is legitimately, legitimately in the ad read that was copy and pasted before we had this conversation. The reality is sometimes being a boss in a small business means gathering up everything your new employee needs to get started while your own to do list keeps growing. The team over at electric knows small businesses, maybe like yours face these challenges. That's why they're on hand to help with time consuming parts of your business like standardized device security with best in class device management software so you can implement best practices across the board and be ready to scale and employee onboarding and offboarding done for you, saving you an average of eight hours per request. Plus electric will help you keep a single point of visibility into your it environment to control your devices, networks and applications while simplified reporting allows you to achieve and maintain compliance and proactive it recommendations and automated workflows make it easy to manage for even non-technical users. And look, if you're hearing this and you think your company could use some of those services, but you're not quite sure where to start, electrics experts will guide you through the process of establishing standardized IT processes for your organization. The importance of delegating in order to focus on what you're good at is the absolute baseline of my company. The unicorn sidekick comes in to help pull those things from your to do list to make sure that you can concentrate on what you're good at. And the best thing for this, like having something like electric come in and take care of this, especially if you have that mid-sized business, so something more than like 10 employees, it becomes so much easier to use a company like electric than to try and have and hire a chief technical officer that's in charge of all of this device management. What a waste of time and money. Yeah. I mean, we are spending, like right now, my primary thing that I'm doing at my job is building a system that helps people do the things that they do best. And it's like basically they have hired me to bang my head against the wall so that others don't have to. And I mean, as someone who has done this before, not just as a developer, but as an IT specialist, there have been so many moments where I was just like, I wish I had some tool that just made this easier. And it sounds like electric is that tool. It definitely does. For conduit listeners, electric is offering a free pair of Beats Solo three headphones for taking a qualified meeting. Just go to electric.ai slash conduit. That's electric.ai slash conduit. Go there now to get your free pair of Beats Solo three headphones today for scheduling a meeting. Our thanks to electric for their support of this show and all of Really FM. And this time around, we are going to Catalan and saying gracias. Hey Jay, what is your connection? So it is the time is approaching where lots of time is it conference. Time. Oh, it's it's it's it's okay. Sorry. It's about that. We've been listening to a lot of Hamilton. Like it is on repeat in our car in shuffle. I was just told that something is happening sooner than we communicated on on our team internally, and I was not really prepared for that. So what I want to accomplish in the next conduit, because it might literally just be a conduit that this thing that I thought I had months to do is going to happen. I want to create some long term support structure for this work project. I don't even know what it looks like yet. I have a meeting with one of my one of my colleagues that is helping in this project, and we're going to kind of lay out the game plan for this. And it'll be my job as the project lead to to make sure that that's a reality and kind of put those pieces in place and, you know, stay on track with it. So my goal, my connection for this conduit is to get the organization plan set up and underway. And hopefully I'll be able to do that. Who knows, I might have to to go reach for for OmniFocus and start start logging stuff and getting stuff in there. Maybe. I don't know. Maybe. My connection is to survive the podcast. I have looked at the schedule so many times and I'm already tired, but it's OK because the day of the energy is going to be lit. I'm super excited. Jason and I are flying together for the last like span of our trip into Memphis, which is going to be so much fun. We're not sitting together because I upgraded to whatever the economy plus or whatever. I want some more extra room. And I had a couple Comfort Plus, whatever. I don't know, through Delta, whatever it's called. Yeah. Yeah. So I wanted a little bit of leg room. So I'm pretty sure we are not seated next to each other, but that's OK because we will arrive at the same time and get picked up and it's going to be a party and a lot of hard work. So yeah, it's going to be it's going to be fun, but it's going to also be a lot of hard work. And I am hoping to have my rhythm on. But make sure you check out the podcast on 12 hours. And our schedule is jam. It is it is so full. It's going to be bananas, but I cannot wait. I cannot wait. I am looking forward to a very special podcast on this time. I mean, they've they've all been fantastic. But this time, just again, having having seen Kathy in her element, whether we were on a ship with these, you know, I leech things or we were trying to kick Gail off of our team together or even getting help and just making sure that people are staying hydrated and are being taken care of. I I just feel like bringing Kathy in is like calling in the specialists. So I can't wait to see you in your element, see everybody else in their element. And again, it's for the kids. And I absolutely love I absolutely love watching and getting to participate in some small level for this event. Amazing. What about our conductors, including our brand new conductor? Brand new. No name. I'm trying to find the thing on the slide. I know it's it's it's so Carly Knight Art. So I think artists of the show might be temporary artists of the show until they can let us know what their name is. Yes. Connection just discovered the show. Love it. Hey, I like that. Just became a conductor. I love it. Job hunting right now. And the goal is to rewrite the resume. How do I access the co-working session? Do I get an email about it? Yes, you will get an email about it. It happens usually the day of because we're really day before. Day before. OK, Kathy's in charge of all of that. So 98 percent of the time it has come out the day before it. Thank you very much. Absolutely. So, yes, you will get an email about this about the co-working session the day before with the link. There's no particular topic. Just be there. Be ready to have a great time. And we're so excited that we have a new conductor. I you would think that I read the notes before we do a show. Spoiler alert. No. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron, says new connection. Figure out what supplies slash tools I need for a camping trip in October. Since it'll be a little cooler than I'm used to, I want to make sure I am prepared. Yes, please don't freeze to death. And our pathos, professional podcasters, our pathologists of the show, Laura says, try to get some of the sometimes try to get some of the sometimes small, sometimes big tasks that have been sitting on my list forever done, at least started setting a current remind a recurring. Wow. Words recurring reminder to pick up one of these types of tasks daily. We'll see. I think you'll do great in this. Our tire advocate of the show, Chinta says next connection. I have a couple of sewing projects that I'd like to do, so I should inventory my fabric stash before I buy more of the same. Whoa, that's a thing you could do. You. Not just go to the store and like buy more. I'm just kidding. You can do it. And our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica says new connection, clean out and sort at least one drawer of my dresser. Remind yourself it's it's as you're doing it. It's one drawer. It's one thing in the drawer at a time until eventually there are no more things in the drawer. You can do that. If you're feeling the rhythm, feel free to do more drawers. Yes. Our soprano of the show, Debo says next connection. I need to start sorting through my clothes and the next conduit. I should sort at least one drawer drawer of clothes. Maybe you and Erica can hang out and sort your drawers together. A good suggestion would be Tuesday during our coworking session. And our fish bear of the show, Fishakai says help a fifth grader learn how to use a planner for school. OK, this is the nerdiest most conduit thing ever. And I'm absolutely here for it. So much. Have you like if you can teach a fifth grader about the tire method and you get that trending in a school. Oh, my goodness. It will absolutely make my day. It'll make my year. Our shark of the show, one pair of shoes says my next connection is to do a rough outline of a book that I have been thinking of writing for a while. Details will be shared in due time. I cannot wait to hear about the book. And I'm so excited for you to do that rough outline. That's amazing. What a good start. What a good way to start a book. And it's almost an ariamo. So you're already like prepped. And also just the pure fact that we have authors in in our channel just gives me the like, hey, we could you could very likely get some support inside of the relay FM switch on Discord. Absolutely. Yeah, that it's going to be great. You got this. The panda of the show, James says, try to fix the bugs in the app as they are found, but also try to fix the bugs in myself. I think I think there's medicine for that and recover from all the unhealthy living. There's still time to find the cave from a few find that cave from a few episodes. What is this cave from a few episodes ago? He wanted to run away and go live in a cave. There's probably more bugs in the cave. And if you have some in you that you're trying to get out, you shouldn't go to the cave where there are more. Yeah, remember, we got this the suction eyeball lizard slime things in a cave. Yeah. Oh, that's right. That's where I wiped it. Yeah. Yeah. Our mountain dweller of the show, Logan says next, next connection. Fall has fallen around here. So I really need to winterize the house to prevent critters from taking up residence for the winter. Speaking of bugs, let's get those bugs out of there. It's never winter here, at least not at night. Um, our train enthusiast of the show, Relsie says, apply for at least 10 jobs by the next co working session. And another another 10 by the next conduit. That's a lot of jobs. I don't have a lot of time to do nothing. And I think having a strict goal. Oh, sorry, it's really late out here. It's need to we're almost done. Keep it together. But it's also but it's also low at the same time in reality. Yeah, the the thing that I remember someone saying is when you are searching for a job, you're probably working harder than you are when you are actually in said job. So I wish you the best. Stay hydrated. Stay positive. I know that it feels super demoralizing just going through the process again and again and again. And unfortunately, our systems aren't always the best for handling stuff. So stay positive if you need if you need a reminder of that reach out to us. I'm sure that we'll be always be happy to to give you a big thumbs up and a pat on the back. And of course, the you can do it. Absolutely. And follow up to Railsie's previous connection between him panicking about not doing it on time. Love do to finding out that conduit is being delayed and not knowing what to do delayed. I from when they put this in, I've done some good work while listening to the same track over and over again. So I've done my resume and made sure it was right and applied for a QA lead job at BT. I feel somewhat under qualified for. But we shall see what happens. I can do it. We only apply to jobs that were under qualified for. Yes. Because we always put ourselves down. And we often think of ourselves lower than where we actually are. So yeah, that's that's actually a trick that someone once told me, like always apply for something that you don't feel qualified for because it'll help you understand where you actually are. Yep. And our Oracle of the show, Soph says it's time to actually write the next journal articles, two of them in the next fortnight. I will submit a proposal for one and write two sections of the other. I need to Soph, like, can we get a workshop on how you do this? Like, what is this process? Because I would love to be able to write and just be like, it's writing time and actually write the thing and then be done writing the thing because I hate writing almost as much as I hate reading.
