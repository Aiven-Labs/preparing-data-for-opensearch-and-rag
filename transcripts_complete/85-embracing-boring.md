So yeah, give us some ideas for episode 100, what we should do. But send them into feedback into the. Yeah, use the feedback form
This is episode 85. So 15 episodes while yes, we are like by month, like not by monthly. We are by weekly. That means it's going to happen faster than you think. So yeah, give us some ideas for episode 100, what we should do. But send them into feedback into the. Yeah, use the feedback form Yes, that. And last but not least, our nameless of the show, nameless says, fence has been built, new, but now repeat on the other side. Also course was done before the VK and we got to really enjoy the Pacific Northwest. Good. I'm so glad. Also I don't remember how school was going
Yes, that. And last but not least, our nameless of the show, nameless says, fence has been built, new, but now repeat on the other side. Also course was done before the VK and we got to really enjoy the Pacific Northwest. Good. I'm so glad. Also I don't remember how school was going So I'm wondering if like is school done? Are we done with school now? Time is weird. I don't know how time works, but super happy for you. This episode of conduit is brought to you by Ecam. Ecam live is the leading video production and live streaming studio built for the Mac
So I'm wondering if like is school done? Are we done with school now? Time is weird. I don't know how time works, but super happy for you. This episode of conduit is brought to you by Ecam. Ecam live is the leading video production and live streaming studio built for the Mac Ecam does all aspects of video, not just live streaming. It's perfect for simplifying your workflow. It's easy enough to get started quickly, but powerful enough that you can create just about anything with video. You can do it all with the Ecam app
Ecam does all aspects of video, not just live streaming. It's perfect for simplifying your workflow. It's easy enough to get started quickly, but powerful enough that you can create just about anything with video. You can do it all with the Ecam app Kathy, every time I get an ad read for Ecam, I talk about some awesome things that I'm doing, but I want to talk about to this time. Let's start with the quick one. You and I did a live stream. We did for Saint Jude. It was raising what? $500,000. Way back when? Once upon a time
Kathy, every time I get an ad read for Ecam, I talk about some awesome things that I'm doing, but I want to talk about to this time. Let's start with the quick one. You and I did a live stream. We did for Saint Jude. It was raising what? $500,000. Way back when? Once upon a time Yeah, that was the thingy. The milestone. The milestone. Yes, thank you. Kathy, what was your experience with Ecam? I mean, it was great. I just like hung out and you did the magic. Right? But that's the beauty of it was that we used the Zoom integration with Ecam
Yeah, that was the thingy. The milestone. The milestone. Yes, thank you. Kathy, what was your experience with Ecam? I mean, it was great. I just like hung out and you did the magic. Right? But that's the beauty of it was that we used the Zoom integration with Ecam And for people who are attending the Zoom call, it's seamless. You don't have to do anything. You share your screen like you would share your screen in Zoom because you are sharing your screen in Zoom
And for people who are attending the Zoom call, it's seamless. You don't have to do anything. You share your screen like you would share your screen in Zoom because you are sharing your screen in Zoom And the person who's running the stream, it's just another, it's a window that pops open that you say, hey, Kathy, screen, add it to the stream. And then it just pops up on the stream. Kathy's camera added to the stream
And the person who's running the stream, it's just another, it's a window that pops open that you say, hey, Kathy, screen, add it to the stream. And then it just pops up on the stream. Kathy's camera added to the stream And then also it made it so easy for me because I could send messages to Kathy. And I could also send messages to the chat. And I only had to do it in one window. And when Kathy sent messages in Zoom, it also showed up in the Ecam window. So that was like the first really awesome use
And then also it made it so easy for me because I could send messages to Kathy. And I could also send messages to the chat. And I only had to do it in one window. And when Kathy sent messages in Zoom, it also showed up in the Ecam window. So that was like the first really awesome use And I've been using the Zoom integration and getting better, better at using it every single time and thinking of new ways to include it into my stream workflow, my streaming workflow. But that's not all that I've done with Ecam in the last couple of weeks
And I've been using the Zoom integration and getting better, better at using it every single time and thinking of new ways to include it into my stream workflow, my streaming workflow. But that's not all that I've done with Ecam in the last couple of weeks Kathy, I put on our entire leadership summit live on stream using Ecam. That is, I believe it was from eight from sorry, from nine to 11. So a good two hour little stream to warm it up and make sure things were going. And then from one to six, like we did like a five hour conference live streaming
Kathy, I put on our entire leadership summit live on stream using Ecam. That is, I believe it was from eight from sorry, from nine to 11. So a good two hour little stream to warm it up and make sure things were going. And then from one to six, like we did like a five hour conference live streaming And then I got the screen accession all through Zoom using a camera to capture cards. And that was just so that like presenters could, oh, the setup was amazing. Presidents would basically plug into the projector
And then I got the screen accession all through Zoom using a camera to capture cards. And that was just so that like presenters could, oh, the setup was amazing. Presidents would basically plug into the projector The projector would project on the screen, but the cable was actually connected to a capture card. So then I got the feed of their screen also as a source in Ecam. So basically what the audience saw on the screen is exactly what the people watching the live stream saw
The projector would project on the screen, but the cable was actually connected to a capture card. So then I got the feed of their screen also as a source in Ecam. So basically what the audience saw on the screen is exactly what the people watching the live stream saw And my camera was just pointed at them. So it was just another webcam. So I was able to literally set up an experience for the live folks that had almost no delay. I believe the delay was less than I think it's like a two second delay or something like that. It was fantastic. And it was so easy
And my camera was just pointed at them. So it was just another webcam. So I was able to literally set up an experience for the live folks that had almost no delay. I believe the delay was less than I think it's like a two second delay or something like that. It was fantastic. And it was so easy And it was so easy. It was easy to manage people commenting in the chat. We were able to get we had panels and we were able to ask questions from people in the live stream to the panelists because it was real time. Everything was super easy
And it was so easy. It was easy to manage people commenting in the chat. We were able to get we had panels and we were able to ask questions from people in the live stream to the panelists because it was real time. Everything was super easy It was really easy to favorite questions to say for later and do so many amazing things. Ecam was literally like the cornerstone of that live streaming session. And it made our leadership our leadership summit something that I feel confident in saying that we will do again in the future
It was really easy to favorite questions to say for later and do so many amazing things. Ecam was literally like the cornerstone of that live streaming session. And it made our leadership our leadership summit something that I feel confident in saying that we will do again in the future And I know that Ecam is going to be the solution at the heart of those future ones as well. I love that. I love that so much. Yep

I now have a shirt that says it. Never forget switch on. Yeah. Oh, really? That's cool I'm telling you that. For ever, never mind. I'm not going to say that. Forever switched on in our hearts. Love a memorial for it. It'll be great. So, Kathy, we talked about this a little bit in the pre show. Kind of a little bit in the pre show
I'm telling you that. For ever, never mind. I'm not going to say that. Forever switched on in our hearts. Love a memorial for it. It'll be great. So, Kathy, we talked about this a little bit in the pre show. Kind of a little bit in the pre show But what are some boring things that you do in your day to day? Forever week to week? I do a lot of boring things. I love it. I pay people. I send invoices like, ultimately very boring things. But it happens consistently, which makes it even more boring. But I love boring
But what are some boring things that you do in your day to day? Forever week to week? I do a lot of boring things. I love it. I pay people. I send invoices like, ultimately very boring things. But it happens consistently, which makes it even more boring. But I love boring But I love boring. I'm tired of not not all exciting things. Like don't get me wrong. Throw me in the middle of a podcast with on and I'm thriving. You know, am Thank you. We've seen a lot of folks coming on. Let's do it. When the end of the week, they were almost alone
But I love boring. I'm tired of not not all exciting things. Like don't get me wrong. Throw me in the middle of a podcast with on and I'm thriving. You know, am Thank you. We've seen a lot of folks coming on. Let's do it. When the end of the week, they were almost alone That's why the minute I wait for it, they're not ready for it. It's always going to take no time. and I've been doing it long enough now that like, you don't have to think a whole lot, and that's pretty great to kind of have a little bit of a brain break and still be productive
That's why the minute I wait for it, they're not ready for it. It's always going to take no time. and I've been doing it long enough now that like, you don't have to think a whole lot, and that's pretty great to kind of have a little bit of a brain break and still be productive And I kind of love that. Well, I am for one excited that you have embraced boring because I hear this a lot in some of the mentorship stuff that I do is that people get into things for the excitement. And in our world of like, I want to be a software engineer
And I kind of love that. Well, I am for one excited that you have embraced boring because I hear this a lot in some of the mentorship stuff that I do is that people get into things for the excitement. And in our world of like, I want to be a software engineer They always point to the most exciting part of being a developer, which is like seeing the thing that you've built running in production and being able to like go, oh, I solved this really hard coding problem. And the reality is is that you don't get to that point without embracing the boring
They always point to the most exciting part of being a developer, which is like seeing the thing that you've built running in production and being able to like go, oh, I solved this really hard coding problem. And the reality is is that you don't get to that point without embracing the boring Like you mentioned doing the podcast, the podcast, the podcast, can not happen without a bunch of meetings, like a bunch of coordination has to happen. So much. There's so many checklists that get ran, that get done
Like you mentioned doing the podcast, the podcast, the podcast, can not happen without a bunch of meetings, like a bunch of coordination has to happen. So much. There's so many checklists that get ran, that get done And while you may not be the person that's executing everything on that checklist, there's someone probably at all sack that is like doing this thing and making it a reality. Jill is like, my life is 10% exciting, 90% just boring. Yes. You're probably not wrong. Yeah
And while you may not be the person that's executing everything on that checklist, there's someone probably at all sack that is like doing this thing and making it a reality. Jill is like, my life is 10% exciting, 90% just boring. Yes. You're probably not wrong. Yeah Yeah. But I wanted to talk about this from the lens of like how we embrace boring and not just saying, hey, be grateful that you're doing boring things, boring things, and able to exciting things. But like being able to really embrace the boring
Yeah. But I wanted to talk about this from the lens of like how we embrace boring and not just saying, hey, be grateful that you're doing boring things, boring things, and able to exciting things. But like being able to really embrace the boring And the first way that I thought about was the way that everyone does, which is turn boring to exciting by automating it out of your life. Kathy, you taught me how to edit photos, which I will never again ever do. It was so hard. I hated every second of it
And the first way that I thought about was the way that everyone does, which is turn boring to exciting by automating it out of your life. Kathy, you taught me how to edit photos, which I will never again ever do. It was so hard. I hated every second of it I enjoyed it, but oh my gosh, it was so much harder than I thought it was. And it's so funny to me because I was like, I was worried that it was going to be too easy
I enjoyed it, but oh my gosh, it was so much harder than I thought it was. And it's so funny to me because I was like, I was worried that it was going to be too easy But even even in that moment as I was adjusting the brightness and the contrast and not the contrast, the brightness and something else, the shadows and the highlights. And then I was cropping things and I like, I quickly got into a rhythm of all the things that needed to be done
But even even in that moment as I was adjusting the brightness and the contrast and not the contrast, the brightness and something else, the shadows and the highlights. And then I was cropping things and I like, I quickly got into a rhythm of all the things that needed to be done And then immediately started thinking about like, okay, if I were doing this all the time, how would I make it so that I don't have to, I don't have to think about the boring bits. I still have to do them. I just don't have to think about them nearly. It's hard. And I thought about this
And then immediately started thinking about like, okay, if I were doing this all the time, how would I make it so that I don't have to, I don't have to think about the boring bits. I still have to do them. I just don't have to think about them nearly. It's hard. And I thought about this This is a thing that I actually already do with the show that we, the show that we're recording right this moment. I have an audio hijack recipe that used to be a bunch thing
This is a thing that I actually already do with the show that we, the show that we're recording right this moment. I have an audio hijack recipe that used to be a bunch thing But literally I just opened up, or sorry, not audio hijack, Alfred, I just opened up Alfred, the Alfred command and I just type in conduit and it opens up our drive so that I can quickly get to the notes
But literally I just opened up, or sorry, not audio hijack, Alfred, I just opened up Alfred, the Alfred command and I just type in conduit and it opens up our drive so that I can quickly get to the notes It opens up the zoom call and it opens up audio hijack and puts us in the right session type so that I can just hit record. And again, like this is a boring task that has to happen every time. But you know what? It's a lot less boring when it takes two seconds. So I'm as long as it works
It opens up the zoom call and it opens up audio hijack and puts us in the right session type so that I can just hit record. And again, like this is a boring task that has to happen every time. But you know what? It's a lot less boring when it takes two seconds. So I'm as long as it works Yeah, as long as it, and that's one of the reasons why I switched over to audio hijack because it was like not audio hijack. Alfred. Because with Alfred, like I can look at it and see what it's doing
Yeah, as long as it, and that's one of the reasons why I switched over to audio hijack because it was like not audio hijack. Alfred. Because with Alfred, like I can look at it and see what it's doing And what I've even learned is even though I've automated it, I've gotten in such a rhythm of doing those steps anyway that sometimes I do like one or two of the steps before I run the command. And then it's like, oh, let me reload all of this for you. I'm like, oh, darn it. Okay
And what I've even learned is even though I've automated it, I've gotten in such a rhythm of doing those steps anyway that sometimes I do like one or two of the steps before I run the command. And then it's like, oh, let me reload all of this for you. I'm like, oh, darn it. Okay Okay. Well, thanks, I guess. But have you, have you considered or what automation steps have you added into your boring tasks? Uh, yeah. So anytime my kids dance studio or the high school team perform, I take a lot of photos. This past weekend we had a city wide October Fest event. Uh, September
Okay. Well, thanks, I guess. But have you, have you considered or what automation steps have you added into your boring tasks? Uh, yeah. So anytime my kids dance studio or the high school team perform, I take a lot of photos. This past weekend we had a city wide October Fest event. Uh, September Uh, September. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's traditionally when October Fest happens. Don't ask me why. Don't ask me why it don't understand it, but it's fine. It's not it's not for me. It's not my choice. But yes, it happens in September. Um, so there are four teams that perform
Uh, September. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's traditionally when October Fest happens. Don't ask me why. Don't ask me why it don't understand it, but it's fine. It's not it's not for me. It's not my choice. But yes, it happens in September. Um, so there are four teams that perform And I took about 2000 photos, uh, both myself and my second shooter of those four performances. Um, and I am not going to do what you were doing for each of those individual images, uh, on the stream, um, because no, I don't mean trying to edit photos in a design tool. Yeah. Yeah
And I took about 2000 photos, uh, both myself and my second shooter of those four performances. Um, and I am not going to do what you were doing for each of those individual images, uh, on the stream, um, because no, I don't mean trying to edit photos in a design tool. Yeah. Yeah Yeah. Yeah. That, that definitely, that definitely helped, uh, contribute to that. Um, so I have a process where, uh, in light room, I will sink the images because it's the same, um, or close enough to the same lighting condition
Yeah. Yeah. That, that definitely, that definitely helped, uh, contribute to that. Um, so I have a process where, uh, in light room, I will sink the images because it's the same, um, or close enough to the same lighting condition So I can just edit and change, you know, the exposure and the white highlights shadows, et cetera, to make it look the best that it can. Um, and then I export, uh, all of those images
So I can just edit and change, you know, the exposure and the white highlights shadows, et cetera, to make it look the best that it can. Um, and then I export, uh, all of those images And then you run it through a Photoshop batch processing thing, which will add an, uh, pretty filter type thing to just kind of make it all look consistent, resize and slap my logo on there. Uh, this runs through Photoshop automatically. So I don't have to do it
And then you run it through a Photoshop batch processing thing, which will add an, uh, pretty filter type thing to just kind of make it all look consistent, resize and slap my logo on there. Uh, this runs through Photoshop automatically. So I don't have to do it And, uh, so I also, I don't, I no longer call anything, which is what it, when you take out the bad pictures, um, before you're sharing, and that has saved me probably 10 hours easily each time. Um, and I don't know why I didn't just skip that in the past because nobody cares
And, uh, so I also, I don't, I no longer call anything, which is what it, when you take out the bad pictures, um, before you're sharing, and that has saved me probably 10 hours easily each time. Um, and I don't know why I didn't just skip that in the past because nobody cares Um, if there are some blurry pictures or bad pictures or anything like that, it's totally fine. And so I just let myself run it through, uh, and then upload them and I'm done. And so my actual, like, process that I am physically doing things is about an hour total
Um, if there are some blurry pictures or bad pictures or anything like that, it's totally fine. And so I just let myself run it through, uh, and then upload them and I'm done. And so my actual, like, process that I am physically doing things is about an hour total And that includes having to, like, troubleshoot when the upload problem doesn't work for some reason. Like this last time where I had to, um, like use Chrome instead. And that was for some reason. So far, I was in working
And that includes having to, like, troubleshoot when the upload problem doesn't work for some reason. Like this last time where I had to, um, like use Chrome instead. And that was for some reason. So far, I was in working You mentioned, uh, a point there that I think is really amazing, which is like, you could do more. However, nobody cares. Yeah. It's that I think that that's one of the things that we kind of forget about in terms of, like, oh, I want it to be perfect
You mentioned, uh, a point there that I think is really amazing, which is like, you could do more. However, nobody cares. Yeah. It's that I think that that's one of the things that we kind of forget about in terms of, like, oh, I want it to be perfect And it's like, honestly, it doesn't have to be perfect. It just needs to be like, mostly good. Like, you could probably save yourself, you know, a little bit of like, this is, this is something that I will say has gotten me slightly far
And it's like, honestly, it doesn't have to be perfect. It just needs to be like, mostly good. Like, you could probably save yourself, you know, a little bit of like, this is, this is something that I will say has gotten me slightly far Um, but I think I have probably prevented myself from getting even further is that I often want to automate the entire process versus like getting it like 80% of the way there. And there is so much value in like, it doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be better than what it currently is
Um, but I think I have probably prevented myself from getting even further is that I often want to automate the entire process versus like getting it like 80% of the way there. And there is so much value in like, it doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be better than what it currently is And that's a win. Yes. Agreed. I agree. And yeah, I think that's, that's the important thing to think about the overall like, hey, we're, what is the bare minimum and being not necessarily being okay with that. But also being okay with that
And that's a win. Yes. Agreed. I agree. And yeah, I think that's, that's the important thing to think about the overall like, hey, we're, what is the bare minimum and being not necessarily being okay with that. But also being okay with that Like, there is the, what are the priorities? What is a requirement? What is the, what constitutes a successful thing? Um, and leaning into that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and, and then the third piece of this is, is kind of where I, I came from in, in the idea for this as a topic
Like, there is the, what are the priorities? What is a requirement? What is the, what constitutes a successful thing? Um, and leaning into that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and, and then the third piece of this is, is kind of where I, I came from in, in the idea for this as a topic Uh, it's a blog post that I wrote called what I learned from a boring contribution. And that post was mostly in response to, we've been doing this mentorship thing. And the mentorship thing was purely like, hey, we're going to give you experience doing these things
Uh, it's a blog post that I wrote called what I learned from a boring contribution. And that post was mostly in response to, we've been doing this mentorship thing. And the mentorship thing was purely like, hey, we're going to give you experience doing these things Uh, almost like a small internship of some sort. Um, but the reality was like, people were like, oh, this is boring. Like I, I wanted to do the, you're, you're asking me to do all the boring bits. Like, I want to do the fun stuff. I want to do the, the coding that Kathy got to do
Uh, almost like a small internship of some sort. Um, but the reality was like, people were like, oh, this is boring. Like I, I wanted to do the, you're, you're asking me to do all the boring bits. Like, I want to do the fun stuff. I want to do the, the coding that Kathy got to do Like, Kathy gets to write code. How come I got to write documentation? And my answer is Kathy does not want to be a programmer. So don't make me do it. Don't make me do it ever again. I think you can do it. The, but the reality is, oh, I could. No doubts, but I don't want to. True
Like, Kathy gets to write code. How come I got to write documentation? And my answer is Kathy does not want to be a programmer. So don't make me do it. Don't make me do it ever again. I think you can do it. The, but the reality is, oh, I could. No doubts, but I don't want to. True True. Um, but the reality is for these folks who want to be full time software engineers, is that, or full time open source contributors or whatever. Like, you're going to have to do the boring. The boring is the boring has to happen
True. Um, but the reality is for these folks who want to be full time software engineers, is that, or full time open source contributors or whatever. Like, you're going to have to do the boring. The boring is the boring has to happen And there are a lot of things that you can learn from doing the boring. Like, I, I've had this issue where, um, Kathy, some would say less is more. Would you agree with that? Um, yeah, for the most part, I would. Yes
And there are a lot of things that you can learn from doing the boring. Like, I, I've had this issue where, um, Kathy, some would say less is more. Would you agree with that? Um, yeah, for the most part, I would. Yes Yes. So yeah, there's, there's a thing in open source contribution where some people will try to solve all the problems. And then they submit to you all of the problems being solved. And most cases, the people who are, who have to review those changes, just go, no, I'm not going to review this
Yes. So yeah, there's, there's a thing in open source contribution where some people will try to solve all the problems. And then they submit to you all of the problems being solved. And most cases, the people who are, who have to review those changes, just go, no, I'm not going to review this It's too big. It's too many changes at one time. And the problem with that is if something is broken down the road. Now we have to give up all those changes just to revert back. Whereas if we, if each little thing does a little problem, then each little thing solves a small problem
It's too big. It's too many changes at one time. And the problem with that is if something is broken down the road. Now we have to give up all those changes just to revert back. Whereas if we, if each little thing does a little problem, then each little thing solves a small problem Now it's easier for us to go and correct these things if there are issues. So as a part of that, we tell people like, oh, hey, sorry, submit a smaller request
Now it's easier for us to go and correct these things if there are issues. So as a part of that, we tell people like, oh, hey, sorry, submit a smaller request And I've never thought about like what actually goes into the, not the correct way, because I don't think there's a right or wrong way of doing that. But imagine if you just spent 15 hours of like work day, so like almost three days of business time, implementing a thing, you submit it
And I've never thought about like what actually goes into the, not the correct way, because I don't think there's a right or wrong way of doing that. But imagine if you just spent 15 hours of like work day, so like almost three days of business time, implementing a thing, you submit it And then all of a sudden, I tell you, no, do it again, but smaller this time. You're probably going to be really, really frustrated. You're going to be really upset. But if you're doing that with a bunch of boring stuff, then it gives you the time to be able to go like, okay, I did the thing
And then all of a sudden, I tell you, no, do it again, but smaller this time. You're probably going to be really, really frustrated. You're going to be really upset. But if you're doing that with a bunch of boring stuff, then it gives you the time to be able to go like, okay, I did the thing I messed up, Jay personally messed up in doing the thing that I just talked about. And I said, you know what? In doing this boring thing, I made a mistake and I did too much
I messed up, Jay personally messed up in doing the thing that I just talked about. And I said, you know what? In doing this boring thing, I made a mistake and I did too much I'm going to learn the correct way of how to fix this and document it so that in the future, I can save myself time and energy, but also I can now share this as a resource for so many other developers so that instead of feeling dejected or instead of feeling as if now they've got to work, they basically lost all that time and they got to do it all over again
I'm going to learn the correct way of how to fix this and document it so that in the future, I can save myself time and energy, but also I can now share this as a resource for so many other developers so that instead of feeling dejected or instead of feeling as if now they've got to work, they basically lost all that time and they got to do it all over again Here is a significantly faster way to fix that mistake. And again, like if I were working on the most complicated of problems, and then I was like, I know it's big. I'm going to justify myself into like just breaking my own rule. You know what I mean? Like I'm going to do it anyway
Here is a significantly faster way to fix that mistake. And again, like if I were working on the most complicated of problems, and then I was like, I know it's big. I'm going to justify myself into like just breaking my own rule. You know what I mean? Like I'm going to do it anyway I know I messed up. Yep, I own it. However, I don't want to do it again. So therefore we're just going to go with it. But because it was a boring thing, I was like, all right, it's not hard. It's kind of like daunting to do
I know I messed up. Yep, I own it. However, I don't want to do it again. So therefore we're just going to go with it. But because it was a boring thing, I was like, all right, it's not hard. It's kind of like daunting to do But because it's like not the end of the world, I'm just going to learn the right way to do it. And I benefited from it well beyond, like not just that documentation, but I also was able to write a blog post about it, which is actually doing really well on social media. Like I was able to learn
But because it's like not the end of the world, I'm just going to learn the right way to do it. And I benefited from it well beyond, like not just that documentation, but I also was able to write a blog post about it, which is actually doing really well on social media. Like I was able to learn I was able to create a small little graphic. I'm talking about it now. Like this whole podcast episode is based on that boring thing that I did. But then also like the boring thing that encouraged me to do the boring thing was, you know, I've given conference talks about it
I was able to create a small little graphic. I'm talking about it now. Like this whole podcast episode is based on that boring thing that I did. But then also like the boring thing that encouraged me to do the boring thing was, you know, I've given conference talks about it I literally got paid to give a conference talk about the boring thing that I did because I chose to do the boring thing. Well, and not to, you know, to to tout my blow my own horn. I don't know how it works. That's what I do. That's what I do. I do not know how to teach your own Macedon post
I literally got paid to give a conference talk about the boring thing that I did because I chose to do the boring thing. Well, and not to, you know, to to tout my blow my own horn. I don't know how it works. That's what I do. That's what I do. I do not know how to teach your own Macedon post Yeah, not to not to to my own Macedon. Um, this is exactly what my company does. This is what unicorn is all about coming in and taking the boring things off of entrepreneurs plates so that they can concentrate on the exciting and the things that only they can do. I love it. Give us bookkeeping
Yeah, not to not to to my own Macedon. Um, this is exactly what my company does. This is what unicorn is all about coming in and taking the boring things off of entrepreneurs plates so that they can concentrate on the exciting and the things that only they can do. I love it. Give us bookkeeping Give us like the boring. Like let's make sure all the numbers match. Oh, yeah, maybe. Make me a spreadsheet collecting data on people that attended certain event that we can then send like information to with consent. Yes, on it. Perfect. Amazing. Let's do it
Give us like the boring. Like let's make sure all the numbers match. Oh, yeah, maybe. Make me a spreadsheet collecting data on people that attended certain event that we can then send like information to with consent. Yes, on it. Perfect. Amazing. Let's do it Let's do it. I think that is a really good like wrap up topic to that like not everyone's boring is your boring. Yes. You're boring isn't everyone else is boring. Sometimes you're boring is someone else is exciting. Yes
Let's do it. I think that is a really good like wrap up topic to that like not everyone's boring is your boring. Yes. You're boring isn't everyone else is boring. Sometimes you're boring is someone else is exciting. Yes Yes. So maybe it is an opportunity to make a new connection, make a new friend learn why something is really exciting for them. Perhaps you'll be like, oh, hey, cool. I understand why it's exciting now. It became slightly less boring or hey, you like it. I love it
Yes. So maybe it is an opportunity to make a new connection, make a new friend learn why something is really exciting for them. Perhaps you'll be like, oh, hey, cool. I understand why it's exciting now. It became slightly less boring or hey, you like it. I love it I love it. How about I let you do it and give you money. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. That being said, I do think that we have to embrace the boring from time to time. And I do want to shout out a podcast that I think does a really good job of this in some ways. And they are on the relay family
I love it. How about I let you do it and give you money. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. That being said, I do think that we have to embrace the boring from time to time. And I do want to shout out a podcast that I think does a really good job of this in some ways. And they are on the relay family They're in the relay family of podcasts. And I have completely forgotten the name of the podcast because IQ drops as soon as the bike turns on under the radar. Okay. So like I think I think you have like two examples of this
They're in the relay family of podcasts. And I have completely forgotten the name of the podcast because IQ drops as soon as the bike turns on under the radar. Okay. So like I think I think you have like two examples of this Like you have thoroughly considered, which is very much like folks who are like we're building physical things. And it's all exciting all day in and day out, not a boring moment for us whatsoever. It's how they present it
Like you have thoroughly considered, which is very much like folks who are like we're building physical things. And it's all exciting all day in and day out, not a boring moment for us whatsoever. It's how they present it But I would argue that they probably have they have to talk to like supply chains. That's yeah, that's probably a package. Yeah, yeah, they literally have to put things in box. Oh, and put things together. Yeah
But I would argue that they probably have they have to talk to like supply chains. That's yeah, that's probably a package. Yeah, yeah, they literally have to put things in box. Oh, and put things together. Yeah Yeah. I know that they did, I think on Instagram, they did like live streams of like putting pens together. Yeah. So like you can make exploring things somewhat more exciting with a little bit of imagination and a podcast, you know, sometimes podcasting helps
Yeah. I know that they did, I think on Instagram, they did like live streams of like putting pens together. Yeah. So like you can make exploring things somewhat more exciting with a little bit of imagination and a podcast, you know, sometimes podcasting helps But then you also have under the radar, which are two other software engineers talking about the apps that they make. And a lot of what they're talking about are like support management and marketing and things like that. And not going to lie, it's a lot of boring stuff
But then you also have under the radar, which are two other software engineers talking about the apps that they make. And a lot of what they're talking about are like support management and marketing and things like that. And not going to lie, it's a lot of boring stuff A lot of stuff that if they weren't independent developers, if they were a part of a development team, they would not be doing because usually software engineers don't do that. Like you have a support staff or you have marketing professionals that do those things. But they have to learn it
A lot of stuff that if they weren't independent developers, if they were a part of a development team, they would not be doing because usually software engineers don't do that. Like you have a support staff or you have marketing professionals that do those things. But they have to learn it And it's probably mind numbingly boring at times. But I think that it's also really valuable to them as independent app developers in that if they learn marketing, you know, really well, that gives them the advantage over other software engineers
And it's probably mind numbingly boring at times. But I think that it's also really valuable to them as independent app developers in that if they learn marketing, you know, really well, that gives them the advantage over other software engineers And because then they can better market their products, they can better market their applications to us, the people who are going to eventually download those apps. Yep, I agree. That being said, Kathy, I hope that this wasn't a boring episode. But I'm yawning, but that's just because I'm tired
