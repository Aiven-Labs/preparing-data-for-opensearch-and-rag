Maybe it'll be like, you like my channel. I have an account. I'm. You know. I mean, a hacker from Austin. You know hacking today. Hey, I remember my log in. That is always exciting. Um. You all. Lifestreams. Can we just. I'm
We've already signed up. I'm. Well, Okay, we'll just sign up. Maybe it'll be like, you like my channel. I have an account. I'm. You know. I mean, a hacker from Austin. You know hacking today.

I don't think so because I don't think I'm sharing the screen. Volume. Okay. Let's say. I'm. Share. I know. And only let's be selected. I will come up with another way. Let's go back sharing that one
Can we just. I'm. No, I can't hear myself. Thank you. Good fighter. Can you guys hear that though? I don't think so because I don't think I'm sharing the screen. Volume. Okay. Let's say. I'm. Share. I know. And only let's be selected. I will come up with another way. Let's go back sharing that one Yay. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. It's where I've learned how to do this in OBS now. But like you don't do the same thing in stream yard. Stream yard is different. Music. And music. Uh. Let's see. I'm. And they do say that you can use this for streaming to. So I'm not using this illegally. I thank you
Yay. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. It's where I've learned how to do this in OBS now. But like you don't do the same thing in stream yard. Stream yard is different. Music. And music. Uh. Let's see. I'm. And they do say that you can use this for streaming to. So I'm not using this illegally. I thank you I thank you. Yeah, I have a ton of different glasses, which I should probably actually look into. But. Like I need to get my eyes checked because I've had the same script for so long. I'll hide this. Okay, thank you. Need to need to me. Oh, but I won't continue playing
I thank you. Yeah, I have a ton of different glasses, which I should probably actually look into. But. Like I need to get my eyes checked because I've had the same script for so long. I'll hide this. Okay, thank you. Need to need to me. Oh, but I won't continue playing I think I have to make like a full playlist. That one was cool too. Okay, we're going to look into this another time because me trying to do it and. Want me to work. We're going to listen to feeding the ducks in the background. This one did probably
I think I have to make like a full playlist. That one was cool too. Okay, we're going to look into this another time because me trying to do it and. Want me to work. We're going to listen to feeding the ducks in the background. This one did probably Because it's through stream yard, but it only does the one song at a time. It's really loud. Oh, well, we can loop this one song. Maybe I should find a longer song to loop. And then we will get started. Let's go search. That's a decent song. I want a long song. Hmm. We can't listen to me
Because it's through stream yard, but it only does the one song at a time. It's really loud. Oh, well, we can loop this one song. Maybe I should find a longer song to loop. And then we will get started. Let's go search. That's a decent song. I want a long song. Hmm. We can't listen to me Yeah, this one's a new release. I don't know. Is that something? Hmm. I know what I'm just doing. I'm just going to do it. This is very. I don't know why I'm getting so confused on this one right now, but. We will browse some music and try to find something. That is longer to repeat
Yeah, this one's a new release. I don't know. Is that something? Hmm. I know what I'm just doing. I'm just going to do it. This is very. I don't know why I'm getting so confused on this one right now, but. We will browse some music and try to find something. That is longer to repeat Like it just lets you like do it like this. That's why I'm like, I don't know. I just want a longer song. So it doesn't get super annoying. In stream yard when I have a loop. Come on, we need like a five minute song. We got a three minute song. Now, okay
Like it just lets you like do it like this. That's why I'm like, I don't know. I just want a longer song. So it doesn't get super annoying. In stream yard when I have a loop. Come on, we need like a five minute song. We got a three minute song. Now, okay Now, okay. No, no, we're going to put this on the background. Okay. Let's go with database design. Because I was working on this this weekend. And then I haven't looked at it. And when I was trying to explain it earlier today, it got a bit confusing for me
Now, okay. No, no, we're going to put this on the background. Okay. Let's go with database design. Because I was working on this this weekend. And then I haven't looked at it. And when I was trying to explain it earlier today, it got a bit confusing for me I'm going, what was I working on? All right. So those who are new on the stream. Thank you for joining. My name is Jen. I'm a teacher and tech or as I have it of Jen makes tech today. And I have two shows. One's called shit. You don't want to talk about the other is called teach Jen tech
I'm going, what was I working on? All right. So those who are new on the stream. Thank you for joining. My name is Jen. I'm a teacher and tech or as I have it of Jen makes tech today. And I have two shows. One's called shit. You don't want to talk about the other is called teach Jen tech And since I have both of them going on. I am using Astro to work on my website. And I made it so that way this is my homepage. You know, a little bit about. And then I'm going to have something link out to. Teach Jen tech where it has all of that information
And since I have both of them going on. I am using Astro to work on my website. And I made it so that way this is my homepage. You know, a little bit about. And then I'm going to have something link out to. Teach Jen tech where it has all of that information So of each of the episodes, something for shit. You don't want to talk about the podcast. Have everything go there. And then eventually I'm going to get like a virtual business card for work. And that will link out there
So of each of the episodes, something for shit. You don't want to talk about the podcast. Have everything go there. And then eventually I'm going to get like a virtual business card for work. And that will link out there So when this is all said and done, people can go into my name and be able to find all the things. And I'm really looking forward to that. Yet. I haven't. I figured out what I kind of wanted to do. And I was like, you know. This is as far as I got when Chris and I started of. Hey
So when this is all said and done, people can go into my name and be able to find all the things. And I'm really looking forward to that. Yet. I haven't. I figured out what I kind of wanted to do. And I was like, you know. This is as far as I got when Chris and I started of. Hey Hey. These are all things I want as part of my database. I think I have no idea how to do any of this. Like I didn't realize that you have to have different tables. And then being able to call each of them, which does totally make sense. But before last week, it didn't really make sense
Hey. These are all things I want as part of my database. I think I have no idea how to do any of this. Like I didn't realize that you have to have different tables. And then being able to call each of them, which does totally make sense. But before last week, it didn't really make sense And I'm going to go to YouTube and grab that video. It was good video. It's fun. Thank you Chris. I really appreciate it. It. Data. Face. Face. Read. Peace. Here we go. And so I learned a lot that day and going to
And I'm going to go to YouTube and grab that video. It was good video. It's fun. Thank you Chris. I really appreciate it. It. Data. Face. Face. Read. Peace. Here we go. And so I learned a lot that day and going to Moving on from there, I took what we previously had written out, which was like a version of this, which was like show table. It or show is one table. Channel is one table. If we create a table for show, then it's going to go into show ID in the episode. Table
Moving on from there, I took what we previously had written out, which was like a version of this, which was like show table. It or show is one table. Channel is one table. If we create a table for show, then it's going to go into show ID in the episode. Table Table. And then episode channel is going to go into. Episode ID pulling it from there and then channel ID pulling it from channel. Totally made sense to me. I was like, cool. I got this. Yet. And this is my graphic of all of this
Table. And then episode channel is going to go into. Episode ID pulling it from there and then channel ID pulling it from channel. Totally made sense to me. I was like, cool. I got this. Yet. And this is my graphic of all of this What up Anthony? Anthony, have you met Christian yet? Such dope human. More people to get excited about databases. Which. Okay, we'll get there. We'll get there. Let's. Let's learn one thing at a time. One thing at a time
What up Anthony? Anthony, have you met Christian yet? Such dope human. More people to get excited about databases. Which. Okay, we'll get there. We'll get there. Let's. Let's learn one thing at a time. One thing at a time If I use day, no SQL database, I could have just, uh, just shove a JSON object in. Well. Okay. I was going to say it because I did do JSON files previously. If. Anthony is good hub working for you because it wasn't working for me or Chris. I don't know why. Let's see if it works out. It works now

And you're okay. Well, even though it's that I'm still going to go back to my mirror board and work on this for a bit. Because. I'm trying to think. If. These are all like their own tables.

I just sent you the form to fill out to be on the show. On Twitter. Is basically making your tables so reusable and clean as possible. Oh. That's. And. So last week when we, when Chris and I were working together, we were talking about that. To be able To be able. And the reason I have these lines, we should go actually look up. PGM and so I remember what I was doing. Of. And I was thinking about it because it was using the information we had in another table. It is called something. Functional. Feel like that's on it. I'm going to look it up
To be able. And the reason I have these lines, we should go actually look up. PGM and so I remember what I was doing. Of. And I was thinking about it because it was using the information we had in another table. It is called something. Functional. Feel like that's on it. I'm going to look it up See. Oh, hey. Okay. Hey, yay. Hmm. Hmm. I might have deleted it. That would have been annoying. But I might have. Yeah, I liked it into the right accounts. Hmm. No, I don't think so. No. Okay. Let's see this. Log out. I don't think I deleted it
See. Oh, hey. Okay. Hey, yay. Hmm. Hmm. I might have deleted it. That would have been annoying. But I might have. Yeah, I liked it into the right accounts. Hmm. No, I don't think so. No. Okay. Let's see this. Log out. I don't think I deleted it It's one of those things where the definition might come up in a technical interview. But if you follow good logical practices, understanding the ins and outs of it, were trivia, then inherent value. And Anthony, yeah, I still really don't know how to do normalization in use databases all the time
It's one of those things where the definition might come up in a technical interview. But if you follow good logical practices, understanding the ins and outs of it, were trivia, then inherent value. And Anthony, yeah, I still really don't know how to do normalization in use databases all the time But that's mainly because you're deploying them and not data model more than data modeling. Yes. And something that I'm very, I'm very, very fortunate that the like sales
But that's mainly because you're deploying them and not data model more than data modeling. Yes. And something that I'm very, I'm very, very fortunate that the like sales The sales architect and the customer success manager is letting me like hit them up from time to time because I've been their target helping me understand like why people may like have multiple use cases of like different database
The sales architect and the customer success manager is letting me like hit them up from time to time because I've been their target helping me understand like why people may like have multiple use cases of like different database And then also something they first told me about was, which like I knew it, but I didn't know it of dropping data. Like you don't necessarily like it's not going to store the data the entire time. And I'm like, what? What? It's totally logical, but I don't know why I hadn't thought of it
And then also something they first told me about was, which like I knew it, but I didn't know it of dropping data. Like you don't necessarily like it's not going to store the data the entire time. And I'm like, what? What? It's totally logical, but I don't know why I hadn't thought of it Oh, that's good. Yeah. Did code first databases with some of the T3 stack app that Theo has a tutorial on. And I was like, so during our, the Jacob has a Twitter space every week that is called code in life
Oh, that's good. Yeah. Did code first databases with some of the T3 stack app that Theo has a tutorial on. And I was like, so during our, the Jacob has a Twitter space every week that is called code in life So I got really excited to tell them I was like, I did go first and I actually knew what it was. It was very exciting. Okay, you have scheduled scheduled maintenance, but that doesn't mean that's I don't think it's this, but let's find out. It's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I should look at tables that
So I got really excited to tell them I was like, I did go first and I actually knew what it was. It was very exciting. Okay, you have scheduled scheduled maintenance, but that doesn't mean that's I don't think it's this, but let's find out. It's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I should look at tables that Is this one? It is this one. Okay. Oh, okay. I will look it for that now. Do you need any of you? Do you need me? Maybe I just had the other one listed safe. Yay. Okay. That is not great. I do not like all the logins. Nope. That's not what we want. Oh. Hmm. I don't think this is the one we used
Is this one? It is this one. Okay. Oh, okay. I will look it for that now. Do you need any of you? Do you need me? Maybe I just had the other one listed safe. Yay. Okay. That is not great. I do not like all the logins. Nope. That's not what we want. Oh. Hmm. I don't think this is the one we used Damn it. I don't know what it is. Prisma. I like Prisma. It's also what I've been using the most. It's like the OG for me, because I first did it when I was trying to get a job. It is. I really love Prisma. It's just so easy to use. Even before I didn't really understand databases, it's so easy
Damn it. I don't know what it is. Prisma. I like Prisma. It's also what I've been using the most. It's like the OG for me, because I first did it when I was trying to get a job. It is. I really love Prisma. It's just so easy to use. Even before I didn't really understand databases, it's so easy And yes, this is not. Wow. No, no, no, no, no. Well, I'm going to have to start it from scratch. Which is fine. I don't know what it is. I don't think it is. I don't remember what we used. Drizzle and kai-sili. Are they like prisma? They help connect on the back end. Hmm. Hmm. Okay, fine
And yes, this is not. Wow. No, no, no, no, no. Well, I'm going to have to start it from scratch. Which is fine. I don't know what it is. I don't think it is. I don't remember what we used. Drizzle and kai-sili. Are they like prisma? They help connect on the back end. Hmm. Hmm. Okay, fine Hmm. Okay, fine. We will set up anyone. Because I don't think this is it. Let me just go ahead and set. Can I just go leave all of these? Maybe. No, it's not that one either. Remove from server. Yes. And that one was when I used when I was doing it via. I was doing it on the server
Hmm. Okay, fine. We will set up anyone. Because I don't think this is it. Let me just go ahead and set. Can I just go leave all of these? Maybe. No, it's not that one either. Remove from server. Yes. And that one was when I used when I was doing it via. I was doing it on the server I was doing it on the server. So that was the reason. Yeah, you have no tables. It's a-okay, though, because until I'm about to start this new one. Yeah. Yeah. No, you can't delete a server. Okay. Because what I will do is. Luckily, when you are just trying a bunch of things, it's okay
I was doing it on the server. So that was the reason. Yeah, you have no tables. It's a-okay, though, because until I'm about to start this new one. Yeah. Yeah. No, you can't delete a server. Okay. Because what I will do is. Luckily, when you are just trying a bunch of things, it's okay If you delete things because you. It's not as detrimental. And how delete service. There we go. Yes. Yes. Okay. We're going to create a service. And it's going to be Postgres. And we're going to do the free plan. And we're on the way. We're going to name this one. Peach Gen. Okay
If you delete things because you. It's not as detrimental. And how delete service. There we go. Yes. Yes. Okay. We're going to create a service. And it's going to be Postgres. And we're going to do the free plan. And we're on the way. We're going to name this one. Peach Gen. Okay Peach Gen. Okay. Now actually we should call it. N Genad-Website. Don't do. Not delete. That's going to be a complicated name. But hey. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Oh, hey, everybody. Do you have examples of why, like, if I were setting up my website
Peach Gen. Okay. Now actually we should call it. N Genad-Website. Don't do. Not delete. That's going to be a complicated name. But hey. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Oh, hey, everybody. Do you have examples of why, like, if I were setting up my website Just for me, why you might want to do. Secure any inbound IP addresses. Like, it makes a lot of sense when you're working with teams. But I'm just wondering if anybody has ideas of a way. Are you talking about this in a skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, finish. Okay
Just for me, why you might want to do. Secure any inbound IP addresses. Like, it makes a lot of sense when you're working with teams. But I'm just wondering if anybody has ideas of a way. Are you talking about this in a skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, finish. Okay Okay. If you're using Prisma, really recommend doing code first. Uh. Oh, that's a good call. Hmm. I'm debating that because you are absolutely right. I'm going to have a hard time conceptualizing it. That's what I'm doing. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it
Okay. If you're using Prisma, really recommend doing code first. Uh. Oh, that's a good call. Hmm. I'm debating that because you are absolutely right. I'm going to have a hard time conceptualizing it. That's what I'm doing. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it I'm doing it. I'm doing it on doing it. That way because it would be cleaner. Yet. I'm wondering if I'm going to have a hard time conceptualizing it. Because I'm doing it from code first. Instead of the database first
I'm doing it. I'm doing it on doing it. That way because it would be cleaner. Yet. I'm wondering if I'm going to have a hard time conceptualizing it. Because I'm doing it from code first. Instead of the database first You probably won't want to, we didn't want to secure individual IPs, but you might want to block some. That does make sense. And then you need to remember this one. Yeah. Just so that way you guys can see more about it
You probably won't want to, we didn't want to secure individual IPs, but you might want to block some. That does make sense. And then you need to remember this one. Yeah. Just so that way you guys can see more about it I'm just trying to think of is there anything else that I would want to add here? What? Me. I'm going to take a screenshot of this just in case I need earlier. Yeah, that was fun. Okay. Well then we will get hub is wiki now. Let's see. Guest hub. Code. Oh, I do not like it when it's in this form
I'm just trying to think of is there anything else that I would want to add here? What? Me. I'm going to take a screenshot of this just in case I need earlier. Yeah, that was fun. Okay. Well then we will get hub is wiki now. Let's see. Guest hub. Code. Oh, I do not like it when it's in this form Mer. Columns. Thank you. I'm going to delete this because I don't know how old that is on the website. Why am I moved to trash? Wow. I'm blind right now. We're not seeing things as clearly. Hi, Bray. Um. Pathos is a code first GraphQL library
Mer. Columns. Thank you. I'm going to delete this because I don't know how old that is on the website. Why am I moved to trash? Wow. I'm blind right now. We're not seeing things as clearly. Hi, Bray. Um. Pathos is a code first GraphQL library So it's what's used if you had GraphQL and want to do code first approach. Oh. Oh. Um. You can do code first with Prisma and with Postgres and it is. Yes, I'm going to go back up. I think it's NPX. Push. Oh, it's going up. Go up. Go up. Go up. Keep going. It's going to go. It's going to. Yes
So it's what's used if you had GraphQL and want to do code first approach. Oh. Oh. Um. You can do code first with Prisma and with Postgres and it is. Yes, I'm going to go back up. I think it's NPX. Push. Oh, it's going up. Go up. Go up. Go up. Keep going. It's going to go. It's going to. Yes It's going to. Yes. And the X Prisma DB push. Oh, I don't like Prisma issues. I got excited because I I learned this from doing the T3 stack. And. Let me show you. Maybe, maybe. Okay. One. And we're going to see. Okay. It's. You need to mean you need to need to need to need
It's going to. Yes. And the X Prisma DB push. Oh, I don't like Prisma issues. I got excited because I I learned this from doing the T3 stack. And. Let me show you. Maybe, maybe. Okay. One. And we're going to see. Okay. It's. You need to mean you need to need to need to need Do you need to need to need. Do you need to need to. Um. Yes, I'm referencing this is because this is where I learned it. Um, so. I don't. Honestly, no, schema. I've been doing it off of the video so I'm just curious if I'm not seeing it in here, but the video itself, I don't want noise
Do you need to need to need. Do you need to need to. Um. Yes, I'm referencing this is because this is where I learned it. Um, so. I don't. Honestly, no, schema. I've been doing it off of the video so I'm just curious if I'm not seeing it in here, but the video itself, I don't want noise It's like back here. It's before clerk. I'm trying to do this off a memory and I haven't been able to, because it's setting it up with clerk and for authorization. And then he set up planet scale, but I set it up with Ivan just to see if it did it. I'm going to do this just that way
It's like back here. It's before clerk. I'm trying to do this off a memory and I haven't been able to, because it's setting it up with clerk and for authorization. And then he set up planet scale, but I set it up with Ivan just to see if it did it. I'm going to do this just that way I can try to see. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You know, you can. You know what? It may be... I don't know. I will look it up later and see if I can... We'll see if I can figure it out, but I originally learned from watching this video
I can try to see. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. You know, you can. You know what? It may be... I don't know. I will look it up later and see if I can... We'll see if I can figure it out, but I originally learned from watching this video I will say something that I wish, maybe if I open it in YouTube, it will help. No, I don't want to see your ads. Go away. So more. Ah! Oh, we got to watch the ad really quick, guys. Please, and bye. Good news. It's silent. No, I don't want the trial. What I wanted was... No, it was the first one
I will say something that I wish, maybe if I open it in YouTube, it will help. No, I don't want to see your ads. Go away. So more. Ah! Oh, we got to watch the ad really quick, guys. Please, and bye. Good news. It's silent. No, I don't want the trial. What I wanted was... No, it was the first one Yeah. Anyway, in here it shows how it's setting it up and... Okay, that is a... Okay, first question. Anthony, I don't think you're doing it. I like that answer. Yes, because it's way dober on Ivan. The way like Ivan working on understanding it is with..
Yeah. Anyway, in here it shows how it's setting it up and... Okay, that is a... Okay, first question. Anthony, I don't think you're doing it. I like that answer. Yes, because it's way dober on Ivan. The way like Ivan working on understanding it is with.... And this is again, me, newer in the industry. So trying to understand why..
.. And this is again, me, newer in the industry. So trying to understand why.... Why would people go to AWS or Google Cloud or something? The way I've been interested is you can have your database host like put there and then it will charge you as you expand it in the storage you have, but you have to manage all of like your updates and your security on it, your all of that
.. Why would people go to AWS or Google Cloud or something? The way I've been interested is you can have your database host like put there and then it will charge you as you expand it in the storage you have, but you have to manage all of like your updates and your security on it, your all of that And with Ivan, you don't have to. So especially they just launched their free tier about a month ago. And so that's kind of what I've been learning on and a big reason. I'm only like three months old as at Ivan
And with Ivan, you don't have to. So especially they just launched their free tier about a month ago. And so that's kind of what I've been learning on and a big reason. I'm only like three months old as at Ivan So a lot of my learning has been based on using Ivan just so that way I understand the product. Yeah. I don't know what neon is and... Okay, that's good to know. I will say with Ivan, it's still hosted on Google Cloud or AWS. The... Hold on. I'll have to log into another account
So a lot of my learning has been based on using Ivan just so that way I understand the product. Yeah. I don't know what neon is and... Okay, that's good to know. I will say with Ivan, it's still hosted on Google Cloud or AWS. The... Hold on. I'll have to log into another account I'm going to close it. Let's go back. Okay. I know that I said don't delete on this, but I'm totally going to delete it since it's brand new. Just because I think this will help me be able to explain to you. Okay, create a service under Postgres. So you can still set up your cloud provider
I'm going to close it. Let's go back. Okay. I know that I said don't delete on this, but I'm totally going to delete it since it's brand new. Just because I think this will help me be able to explain to you. Okay, create a service under Postgres. So you can still set up your cloud provider So it's still being hosted on your cloud provider of your choice. So when we go with the free plan, it's on AWS. And then you can still like choose your service region and name it. Literally just going to set it up. Know you're telling me learn. It's really important
So it's still being hosted on your cloud provider of your choice. So when we go with the free plan, it's on AWS. And then you can still like choose your service region and name it. Literally just going to set it up. Know you're telling me learn. It's really important And it's hard to when you don't know the ins and outs of databases or like what they all do to be able to talk to it. Granted, I am three months old. And I believe in, oh my gosh, y'all. Teach Gen. Tech. It's almost a year old. All those exciting
And it's hard to when you don't know the ins and outs of databases or like what they all do to be able to talk to it. Granted, I am three months old. And I believe in, oh my gosh, y'all. Teach Gen. Tech. It's almost a year old. All those exciting All those exciting. That is really crazy to think that I didn't know the difference between CSS HTML and JavaScript three months ago. Oh, just as like a rims I know that has nothing to do with databases is. I'm going to start applying for talks on TypeScript to. Because that's cool
All those exciting. That is really crazy to think that I didn't know the difference between CSS HTML and JavaScript three months ago. Oh, just as like a rims I know that has nothing to do with databases is. I'm going to start applying for talks on TypeScript to. Because that's cool I like databases and typescript. Why? So weird. I never would have imagined that. But yes. Oh, yeah, talks are the easy part. If I know a topic, I'll talk about it. Talks are, that sounds really weird. It's not like they're easy. It's
I like databases and typescript. Why? So weird. I never would have imagined that. But yes. Oh, yeah, talks are the easy part. If I know a topic, I'll talk about it. Talks are, that sounds really weird. It's not like they're easy. It's It's. I don't know the tech and how to talk about it is what I have a hard hard time with where. If somebody wants me to go out and say, and talk to people about stuff, yeah, I've been handed the mic many times that they're like, hey, Jen, go talk. Okay
It's. I don't know the tech and how to talk about it is what I have a hard hard time with where. If somebody wants me to go out and say, and talk to people about stuff, yeah, I've been handed the mic many times that they're like, hey, Jen, go talk. Okay Okay. I will say that also live streaming and having a podcast makes it a lot easier too because then you learn how to work on it. On the fly as well. See you. Oh. That's a good call. That's a good call Anthony
Okay. I will say that also live streaming and having a podcast makes it a lot easier too because then you learn how to work on it. On the fly as well. See you. Oh. That's a good call. That's a good call Anthony I, it's something that I, I don't know why the both two of them like are really cool to me. I still feel like that's weird, but that's okay. Let's skip the step. We are skipping the step. Skip again. Then you're set up. Okay. And we're gonna go to
I, it's something that I, I don't know why the both two of them like are really cool to me. I still feel like that's weird, but that's okay. Let's skip the step. We are skipping the step. Skip again. Then you're set up. Okay. And we're gonna go to Oh, now I have to remember how to install my stuff. Good. Keep it this. Get my website on my computer. Maybe. Maybe. What? No. For the sponsor one. Is that what gets the sponsorship on here? That goes to you. I'm not, I'm not mad at it. I don't know. I don't know what to talk about it a lot
Oh, now I have to remember how to install my stuff. Good. Keep it this. Get my website on my computer. Maybe. Maybe. What? No. For the sponsor one. Is that what gets the sponsorship on here? That goes to you. I'm not, I'm not mad at it. I don't know. I don't know what to talk about it a lot I tried to reference that. I don't mind. I think it's a good thing because you're the one who built it. Okay. Yes. Yes. That is something y'all. I am working on is I'm you start looking for sponsorships. I'm going to do a post episodes on both on both like shows. Then I can get my podcast back
I tried to reference that. I don't mind. I think it's a good thing because you're the one who built it. Okay. Yes. Yes. That is something y'all. I am working on is I'm you start looking for sponsorships. I'm going to do a post episodes on both on both like shows. Then I can get my podcast back That would be exciting. Because that's the biggest thing is I'm not great at the pre and post stuff. I can do them. I can't do them. I know how to do them. I don't enjoy doing them. Okay. Let's do an update. That's fine. Maybe it doesn't take that one. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
That would be exciting. Because that's the biggest thing is I'm not great at the pre and post stuff. I can do them. I can't do them. I know how to do them. I don't enjoy doing them. Okay. Let's do an update. That's fine. Maybe it doesn't take that one. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can close this one. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. See the website. Yeah. Yeah. I have to go look at the docs. Oh my goodness. Is this. Anthony, I feel like I'm actually listening to you. I'm going to the docs. You and Josh. I'm giggling because it's kind of funny when. Yeah
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can close this one. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. See the website. Yeah. Yeah. I have to go look at the docs. Oh my goodness. Is this. Anthony, I feel like I'm actually listening to you. I'm going to the docs. You and Josh. I'm giggling because it's kind of funny when. Yeah Yeah. If I like you miss something on the book or something along the lines, it was. They are important. I just I forget about them a lot. I'm like, I'm going to do it. Especially when they have a quick start thing. I'm like, oh, quick start. I can just do that
Yeah. If I like you miss something on the book or something along the lines, it was. They are important. I just I forget about them a lot. I'm like, I'm going to do it. Especially when they have a quick start thing. I'm like, oh, quick start. I can just do that I can just do that. And then I'm not reading through everything. That's the problem. They are so good. I know. I know. They are. They are. And. I want to add it to an existing project. Yes, we're doing it with those. Yay. I will say that asterisks have definitely improved
I can just do that. And then I'm not reading through everything. That's the problem. They are so good. I know. I know. They are. They are. And. I want to add it to an existing project. Yes, we're doing it with those. Yay. I will say that asterisks have definitely improved Or I got more knowledge, but I'm pretty sure it's both. I'm not really sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I was going to say that. I said that way because. But it was also my first website that I ever built with asterisks on my old website. And since then, I actually know what to look for
Or I got more knowledge, but I'm pretty sure it's both. I'm not really sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I was going to say that. I said that way because. But it was also my first website that I ever built with asterisks on my old website. And since then, I actually know what to look for But it's also just pretty. These stocks are pretty. Oh, hey, this one's newer. Learn in reference. That is fun. Set up Prisma. Okay. Yeah. Then that would be what I wanted. I'm going to use. This should be fine. I don't need. Thank you go over here. Minimize that. Oh, we got the angry unicorn
But it's also just pretty. These stocks are pretty. Oh, hey, this one's newer. Learn in reference. That is fun. Set up Prisma. Okay. Yeah. Then that would be what I wanted. I'm going to use. This should be fine. I don't need. Thank you go over here. Minimize that. Oh, we got the angry unicorn I feel like something. I would want to work on at some point would be like postgres stocks. At least as a new user, it was very, very confusing to get started. But I'm also waiting to see if it's something. That I just didn't understand very well. Oh, you should be on his show. You'd be an Anthony
I feel like something. I would want to work on at some point would be like postgres stocks. At least as a new user, it was very, very confusing to get started. But I'm also waiting to see if it's something. That I just didn't understand very well. Oh, you should be on his show. You'd be an Anthony So that would be cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to build weight. Before you do that, Anthony, is your whisper AI thing live yet? I want to use it. Can you feel that please? Thanks. Okay. That would be totally happy. I'm going to use it. I really want to use it
So that would be cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to build weight. Before you do that, Anthony, is your whisper AI thing live yet? I want to use it. Can you feel that please? Thanks. Okay. That would be totally happy. I'm going to use it. I really want to use it I can start putting that as part of in the database. I'm using an existing project. I'm using an existing project. I'm using an existing project. I'm pretty sure I do have guests next week. I don't know. What am I doing next week? I do have a veil next week. Monday and Tuesday, Anthony
I can start putting that as part of in the database. I'm using an existing project. I'm using an existing project. I'm using an existing project. I'm pretty sure I do have guests next week. I don't know. What am I doing next week? I do have a veil next week. Monday and Tuesday, Anthony But I know you've been on this show like a million times, but I finally got like a form for all this setup. So I'm going to send it to you. I'm going to send it to you. I can actually keep track and be like, Hey, this person was on the show. I should probably follow up with them
But I know you've been on this show like a million times, but I finally got like a form for all this setup. So I'm going to send it to you. I'm going to send it to you. I can actually keep track and be like, Hey, this person was on the show. I should probably follow up with them Granted, everybody is really cool and normally comes to hang out. Give me a second. I'm going to send it to you. I'm going to send it to you. Or Tuesday at the same time. 12 PM at my time. 1 PM your time. I'm going to send it to you. I'm going to send it to you.

Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I gave it a great name That way I know that I don't call it something else. In the connection. Hmm. Okay. And y'all I'm going to do the password off screen because actually do you want to keep this one. It's kind of fun. It's the first time I've actually wanted to keep it going. Yay. Okay. It's thinking about it. Okay
That way I know that I don't call it something else. In the connection. Hmm. Okay. And y'all I'm going to do the password off screen because actually do you want to keep this one. It's kind of fun. It's the first time I've actually wanted to keep it going. Yay. Okay. It's thinking about it. Okay Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I know this is a lot of fun, but I'm working on keeping it working. And see. Oh, I know what I'm missing. Actually, no one ever seen this is kind of exciting. I need to do a PG connect for it for Postgres. That may help. Okay. Okay
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I know this is a lot of fun, but I'm working on keeping it working. And see. Oh, I know what I'm missing. Actually, no one ever seen this is kind of exciting. I need to do a PG connect for it for Postgres. That may help. Okay. Okay Okay. Okay. You're not going to let me open anything. Okay. Open. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It has been saved. Now we can follow directions. And hopefully make this work. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So we're going to do yes, close. Tools, import, export. This one. Next
Okay. Okay. You're not going to let me open anything. Okay. Open. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It has been saved. Now we can follow directions. And hopefully make this work. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So we're going to do yes, close. Tools, import, export. This one. Next This one. Next. Fine. We will select that group. Hold the bananas. Hold the bananas. It's a lot of steps. Which do get easier with practice, but it's like, I'm again. Okay. So what tables, databases, defaults. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to put the tables in there. Okay. Okay
This one. Next. Fine. We will select that group. Hold the bananas. Hold the bananas. It's a lot of steps. Which do get easier with practice, but it's like, I'm again. Okay. So what tables, databases, defaults. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to put the tables in there. Okay. Okay Okay. Okay. Okay. Not this. Okay. Oh, this is going to make me. This is going to update it. And then update it on GitHub. And then I'm going to have to read. Oh, agreed. I'm going to add the four things that I want. And I just like totally named it wrong. It was just supposed to be episode
Okay. Okay. Okay. Not this. Okay. Oh, this is going to make me. This is going to update it. And then update it on GitHub. And then I'm going to have to read. Oh, agreed. I'm going to add the four things that I want. And I just like totally named it wrong. It was just supposed to be episode And I called it episode table. You are correct. I just named it episode table when I didn't mean to. But hey, I can fix this here. I believe. Yes, I want to change it. And then I'm going to do a reference properly in the. Here because I wanted to reference tags in show. And I can get it to do
And I called it episode table. You are correct. I just named it episode table when I didn't mean to. But hey, I can fix this here. I believe. Yes, I want to change it. And then I'm going to do a reference properly in the. Here because I wanted to reference tags in show. And I can get it to do Yes, yes. I probably wouldn't have noticed it for. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have like noticed for a while, which could have an awkward. So let's see. Can I rename you? Let's. I don't know. Hmm. Properties. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can rename you right here. But this is going to make me
Yes, yes. I probably wouldn't have noticed it for. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have like noticed for a while, which could have an awkward. So let's see. Can I rename you? Let's. I don't know. Hmm. Properties. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can rename you right here. But this is going to make me Not have accurate data. And I'll have to do it. Yeah, that is OK. OK, what do I have one named table? What is the one called table? Oh, it is this one. OK. So there were two. Wow, y'all. I am doing phenomenal. I'm glad that I saw a different one than the one you even meant. This one is cooked
Not have accurate data. And I'll have to do it. Yeah, that is OK. OK, what do I have one named table? What is the one called table? Oh, it is this one. OK. So there were two. Wow, y'all. I am doing phenomenal. I'm glad that I saw a different one than the one you even meant. This one is cooked This one is cooked. Properties. channel. Okay so we got show channel episode. Cool we're doing better now and I need episode to reference show tags and show ID
This one is cooked. Properties. channel. Okay so we got show channel episode. Cool we're doing better now and I need episode to reference show tags and show ID So what's going here? We're gonna go to properties and we're gonna go to constraints for and key and plus and what are we gonna name it? Let's make the smallest I can look at them side by side. We are going to name this one. Why is this so difficult to see? Bro that's annoying. Okay fine
So what's going here? We're gonna go to properties and we're gonna go to constraints for and key and plus and what are we gonna name it? Let's make the smallest I can look at them side by side. We are going to name this one. Why is this so difficult to see? Bro that's annoying. Okay fine Okay fine. Why is this? This is up here. Fine fine we will play by your rules. Don't like your rules but we will play by them. Alright so I want to name this one. Show tags. Oh it is tags. In show. Oh no okay no except. Wanted to have its own tags. So do I have to create that first? Oh my god
Okay fine. Why is this? This is up here. Fine fine we will play by your rules. Don't like your rules but we will play by them. Alright so I want to name this one. Show tags. Oh it is tags. In show. Oh no okay no except. Wanted to have its own tags. So do I have to create that first? Oh my god Yes we said it. Cool. Goons. We will add a column. We will show tags. And it's next. Not known. Save. Back. Back. Back. Properties. Constraints. Foring here. We will add one. And it's the name is show tags. Ons. It's gonna go into show tags. It is reference scene. Show tags. Add. Save
Yes we said it. Cool. Goons. We will add a column. We will show tags. And it's next. Not known. Save. Back. Back. Back. Properties. Constraints. Foring here. We will add one. And it's the name is show tags. Ons. It's gonna go into show tags. It is reference scene. Show tags. Add. Save Add. Save. Oh there is no unique constraint matching giving keys for reference tables. Show. I don't even know what that means. Let's Google. Google is fun. Google is a lot of fun. But show tags use this tags reference tables. Yes changes will be lost. Let's go show and go into properties. Colors
Add. Save. Oh there is no unique constraint matching giving keys for reference tables. Show. I don't even know what that means. Let's Google. Google is fun. Google is a lot of fun. But show tags use this tags reference tables. Yes changes will be lost. Let's go show and go into properties. Colors Colors. Ideas primary key. So local column it is going to go in show tags. And it's going to pull from show reference even the tags there. And so it grabs it. Action. Save. There's no you. Okay Google is fine. You win. You win. We go. There is no unique constraint
Colors. Ideas primary key. So local column it is going to go in show tags. And it's going to pull from show reference even the tags there. And so it grabs it. Action. Save. There's no you. Okay Google is fine. You win. You win. We go. There is no unique constraint Imagine giving keys for reference take Okay, let's take... Guess we all look at this one? Okay, table four... Table R... Hmm... It's because the name... column on bar does not have a unique constraint. Okay, now I get a figure out what a unique constraint is. Lee. Okay. Or form a unique constraint
Imagine giving keys for reference take Okay, let's take... Guess we all look at this one? Okay, table four... Table R... Hmm... It's because the name... column on bar does not have a unique constraint. Okay, now I get a figure out what a unique constraint is. Lee. Okay. Or form a unique constraint What is a unique constraint? Hmm... Okay. Okay, that's hard to read. Oh! Thanks! I would have been googling for a while. Okay. Unique constraint. Okay. Hmm... Yes, yes and yes to both of you. So... I think I get why it's telling me that now. So I have channel episode and show. And..
What is a unique constraint? Hmm... Okay. Okay, that's hard to read. Oh! Thanks! I would have been googling for a while. Okay. Unique constraint. Okay. Hmm... Yes, yes and yes to both of you. So... I think I get why it's telling me that now. So I have channel episode and show. And.. And... under show, I have the columns ID tags and name. And under episode... I have something similar, which is fine. But I think under episode, I need to rename... Instead of trying to import the show tags... or tags as well, and importing show tags, maybe she just renamed this as episode tags
And... under show, I have the columns ID tags and name. And under episode... I have something similar, which is fine. But I think under episode, I need to rename... Instead of trying to import the show tags... or tags as well, and importing show tags, maybe she just renamed this as episode tags So that way when I finally get to my last table of... that I... let me go back over here. Episode channel where everything is... like... the final like step of it. I just need to have episode tags and show tags. I think... I think. This makes my head hurt. Hmm... Hmm... Okay
So that way when I finally get to my last table of... that I... let me go back over here. Episode channel where everything is... like... the final like step of it. I just need to have episode tags and show tags. I think... I think. This makes my head hurt. Hmm... Hmm... Okay Hmm... Hmm... Okay. What happens if I rename this? Rabbities. Name. What's under constraints for show table? Please hold. The... Peaky. And I don't think anything else. Post-crested and I will be friends eventually. But I will say it's like a..
Hmm... Hmm... Okay. What happens if I rename this? Rabbities. Name. What's under constraints for show table? Please hold. The... Peaky. And I don't think anything else. Post-crested and I will be friends eventually. But I will say it's like a.... a kind of weird thing where it's like this is totally frustrating. Yeah, at the same time, it's really fun. I feel like that's probably not a natural reaction. Not sure. And... Hmm... Let's see. Hmm... Let's see. Hmm... Actually, I don't think I need to do it here
.. a kind of weird thing where it's like this is totally frustrating. Yeah, at the same time, it's really fun. I feel like that's probably not a natural reaction. Not sure. And... Hmm... Let's see. Hmm... Let's see. Hmm... Actually, I don't think I need to do it here I need to do it on the last one. Hmm... Yes. Um, meaning that if I create... tags under the show... and then tags under the episode... I can have both of them go to... I think. Just go here. Like... This. Go here. Go here. I think... I think this will work. You go over the... Ah! Or you just..
I need to do it on the last one. Hmm... Yes. Um, meaning that if I create... tags under the show... and then tags under the episode... I can have both of them go to... I think. Just go here. Like... This. Go here. Go here. I think... I think this will work. You go over the... Ah! Or you just... Ah! Or you just... Fine. Go here. What the hell? Yo, bro. What are you doing? Okay, that's not gonna be straight, whatever. And then we can move this one. Ah! Family, not that one. Not nice. This one right here. And then you... Let's see if this works. And... So... Go here. Go here
. Ah! Or you just... Fine. Go here. What the hell? Yo, bro. What are you doing? Okay, that's not gonna be straight, whatever. And then we can move this one. Ah! Family, not that one. Not nice. This one right here. And then you... Let's see if this works. And... So... Go here. Go here.. Go here. Go here. And we are going to make a knot. So, fun. Episode, you know. Oh wait, no, we still need to set up some... We're gonna get rid of this same table. Um, episode. And I need to refer... Oh, show ideas. The only one I need to reference. Episode. Represents. Episode. Represents
.. Go here. Go here. And we are going to make a knot. So, fun. Episode, you know. Oh wait, no, we still need to set up some... We're gonna get rid of this same table. Um, episode. And I need to refer... Oh, show ideas. The only one I need to reference. Episode. Represents. Episode. Represents Represents. Colors. Uh... And this column is gonna be named... Show ID. There you come. And your columns references. Show. Save. Hey, did that one right? Well hey, we got one going. Now let's see if I can make the last table. YV. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I can do this. Thank you. It is... I'm gonna get it
Represents. Colors. Uh... And this column is gonna be named... Show ID. There you come. And your columns references. Show. Save. Hey, did that one right? Well hey, we got one going. Now let's see if I can make the last table. YV. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. I can do this. Thank you. It is... I'm gonna get it.. I'm gonna get it. It will happen eventually. We are gonna need this one. Represents. Channel. And do that if it makes me. And. So show. X. Next. Hmm. And. So. Next. Oh. And this out. ID. Integer. And. I never said you were gonna be empty. Whatever. Channel. ID. Nope. It's going to be an integer
.. I'm gonna get it. It will happen eventually. We are gonna need this one. Represents. Channel. And do that if it makes me. And. So show. X. Next. Hmm. And. So. Next. Oh. And this out. ID. Integer. And. I never said you were gonna be empty. Whatever. Channel. ID. Nope. It's going to be an integer And last one. Link. Okay. And. I think a link is still a string. Or text. Okay. Hmm. Sure. Let's make them not null. And then how do I want this to be the primary key? Hmm. What happens if I do both? I don't know. I feel like that's gonna have really hurt things in the future. But
And last one. Link. Okay. And. I think a link is still a string. Or text. Okay. Hmm. Sure. Let's make them not null. And then how do I want this to be the primary key? Hmm. What happens if I do both? I don't know. I feel like that's gonna have really hurt things in the future. But But. Why not? Let's try it. Save. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. And. What. There's no unique constraints

And. And. And. And. And. What. There's no unique constraints Why am I doing wrong with the tags? Sometimes
Why am I doing wrong with the tags? Sometimes I will say I'm feeling I'm feeling a bit stuck but I've also been working on this for a while and I'm going to go on a little brain dead and for some reason I'm just stuck on tags but I think it's because they're text which does not really give them the oh well yeah I'm gonna try the primary key thing then I can ask chat GBT but I think it's because of text but I wouldn't want it to be like the primary key because I want it to be an identifier I want the episode I do to be the identifier I just want it to reference it oh maybe that's what I need to do constraints okay just reference something without being a foreign key oh run one it is working though that's exciting can this gris reference a column free when I want to spell poem today in another table out being a for without using for an key via primary key oh is Zene hmm let us recognize that former You The chat GPT has a lot to say today
I will say I'm feeling I'm feeling a bit stuck but I've also been working on this for a while and I'm going to go on a little brain dead and for some reason I'm just stuck on tags but I think it's because they're text which does not really give them the oh well yeah I'm gonna try the primary key thing then I can ask chat GBT but I think it's because of text but I wouldn't want it to be like the primary key because I want it to be an identifier I want the episode I do to be the identifier I just want it to reference it oh maybe that's what I need to do constraints okay just reference something without being a foreign key oh run one it is working though that's exciting can this gris reference a column free when I want to spell poem today in another table out being a for without using for an key via primary key oh is Zene hmm let us recognize that former You The chat GPT has a lot to say today Okay. Yeah. I'm going to have to say something. Provide a name for the constraint. Choose unique as the constraint type. Oh. Yes. I don't remember what I was trying to do. I want to use the constraint. Let's go to columns. I don't want episode. I want episode channel. I want to call it
Okay. Yeah. I'm going to have to say something. Provide a name for the constraint. Choose unique as the constraint type. Oh. Yes. I don't remember what I was trying to do. I want to use the constraint. Let's go to columns. I don't want episode. I want episode channel. I want to call it I want to call it. I want to try this. In constraints unique. Use your name. Your definition is episode tags. Hmm. I feel like this is not what I want. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That is so true. Yeah. I don't. I navigate
I want to call it. I want to try this. In constraints unique. Use your name. Your definition is episode tags. Hmm. I feel like this is not what I want. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That is so true. Yeah. I don't. I navigate I navigate. Once you have set up a new unique constraint on the reference column you can proceed. Okay. Hold on. Let's. Let's trash this one. Yes. Okay. Definition. It's we want it to be episode tags. So we're going to include episode tags. And we will name this one unique. Episode tags
I navigate. Once you have set up a new unique constraint on the reference column you can proceed. Okay. Hold on. Let's. Let's trash this one. Yes. Okay. Definition. It's we want it to be episode tags. So we're going to include episode tags. And we will name this one unique. Episode tags Episode tags. Little day. Properties. Constraints. Foreign key. We have a name it episode tags. Colons. Episode tags. And some episode. And seems tags. And safe. There's no unique. Oh. Okay. Hold on. Yes. You need me. Oh. Constraints. Unique. Us. Us. Us. Us.

Because I feel like that would really help. Okay. So let's do this. We will take a screenshot of this. Nothing Nothing. Something. Oh, a lot of. Okay. Mhmm. You'll move snug it all the way over here. I don't need that much information, but hey, around it. It'll, it'll be fine. So we're going to close this. Go to constraints. Go to unique. Oh, because I did the wrong column. I did ID
Nothing. Something. Oh, a lot of. Okay. Mhmm. You'll move snug it all the way over here. I don't need that much information, but hey, around it. It'll, it'll be fine. So we're going to close this. Go to constraints. Go to unique. Oh, because I did the wrong column. I did ID I did ID. What did I do ID? I don't know why I did ID. No, no, no, wait, wait. I don't want to be typed this, so... Can't be! Yes. And... Definition. I guess I should name it. We are looking for tax. We will do the tax. Safe. Okay, we are now going to go to episode channel. Um, go to constraints
I did ID. What did I do ID? I don't know why I did ID. No, no, no, wait, wait. I don't want to be typed this, so... Can't be! Yes. And... Definition. I guess I should name it. We are looking for tax. We will do the tax. Safe. Okay, we are now going to go to episode channel. Um, go to constraints Foring key. Add the damn foring key. Um. We're going to hit this. And then we're going to go up. And then we're going to do episode tax. References. Episode. Tax. Add. Safe. Safe. It worked! The work. We figured it out. Yay, chat GPT. It makes good idea to me. Duh. Oh, I'm so excited
