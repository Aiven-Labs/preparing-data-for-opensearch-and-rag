# Getting Started with this Workshop

In this workshop we will use Aiven for OpenSearch® to deploy and manage our OpenSearch® Service.

We'll also be using this notebook environment. Before we start the workshop, you will need to:

- Setup your developer environment
- Create an Aiven Account


## Setting up your workspace

### Your Developer Environment

Let's turn to our repo. We need to make sure we have all the tools needed for this workshop.

You have a few options that we recommend.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are already in a Codespace/GitPod environment, skip the next steps

### GitHub Codespaces


The easiest is GitHub Codespaces. This is a cloud driven environment provided by GitHub that you can use to ensure you can follow along.

GitHub provides 40 hours of codespaces available to you for free every month.

You will also have all of the python requirements installed for you making it easier to get started.

To use GitHub Codespaces, select the badge below.

> [!CAUTION]
> The button above preconfigures the codespace with an increased memory. This ensures enough resources are available for embeddings and running a local llm

Once the environment is loaded, you will need to install your python requirements

## Create your Aiven Account
