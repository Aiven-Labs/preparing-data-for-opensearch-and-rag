      "Here's some supportive advice on how to be productive while dealing with others:\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, recognizing your strengths and accomplishments, as you mentioned, is a great step towards boosting your productivity. By keeping track of what you've achieved, you can gain confidence and motivation to tackle more tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "To set boundaries with others and maintain your focus during high-productivity periods, consider the following strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Communicate your needs**: Let others know when you're in a focused work mode and prefer minimal interruptions. You can say something like, \"I'm on a deadline for this project, so I'd appreciate it if we could touch base later.\"\n",
      "2. **Schedule breaks**: Plan regular breaks to recharge and respond to messages or calls from others. This way, you'll be more present and energized during your focused work sessions.\n",
      "3. **Establish routines**: Develop consistent routines for checking emails, taking phone calls, or meeting with others. This can help you avoid constant interruptions and maintain a sense of control over your time.\n",
      "4. **Practice assertive responses**: When someone interrupts you, politely but firmly respond by saying, \"I'm in the middle of something important right now. Can we schedule a call for later?\" or \"I'd love to chat with you after I finish this task.\"\n",
      "5. **Set boundaries proactively**: Anticipate situations where you might be interrupted and prepare for them. For example, if someone always tries to discuss personal matters during your work hours, let them know that you're available for chats at specific times only.\n",
      "6. **Reward yourself**: Celebrate small victories by doing something you enjoy or taking a short break after completing tasks. This will help you stay motivated and energized throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, setting boundaries with others is not about being rude or uncooperative; it's about respecting your own time and energy. By prioritizing your productivity and well-being, you'll become more efficient, effective, and happy in the long run!\n",
