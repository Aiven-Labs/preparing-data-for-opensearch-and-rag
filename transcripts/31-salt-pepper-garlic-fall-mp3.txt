From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we can do our own thing with our own productivity systems. Conduit, the show that helps you decide your favorite seasons, whether it's salt, pepper, cumin, garlic salt, or foe. This episode is not brought to you by a sponsor, but we have a very exciting conversation that we will have later in the show after connections, so make sure you stick around. I'm Kathy, and I am joined by the always wonderful and great and incredibly talented traveling J. J. I like the traveling Woolberries, but yes, exactly. Or the traveling pants. Yes. Look, I didn't write anything down, so I'm doing all of this by the seat of my pants, which is why it's terrible. So, oh, the traveling J. That's it's like a bird. It's like a bird blues folk band thing. I like it. The traveling J and the traveling J's. Oh, yes, I'm here for it. You know what else I'm here for? I'm here for shout outs. Yes, I wasn't going to walk right over. Yeah, I wasn't going to say pie at all. No, because I'm definitely not here for pie. I will choose literally anything other than pie. Every time. Give me literally anything. Give me pie before you give me cake. Wow. All right. So welcome to the final episode of Conduit. So many threats. So many threats. Just kidding, though. We I love you, Jay. Let's give our shout outs. Yeah, right now. I don't know. I don't think people can hear the pitter patter of raindrops, but I am coming from a top secret location where addicts tend to go when they are addicted to pins. I am at pin addict headquarters from the wonderful pin addicts podcast from Relay FM. So John and it yeah, this is great. A little known fact, the the host and creator of the pin addict, Brad Dowdy, and I used to live in the same town. And did not know until I moved away a long, long time ago. So now we are I am visiting family, which means I am also visiting Brad, which means I'm also getting my fix of analog tools, which is great. I always enjoy a visit. So, yeah, shout out to Brad for letting me use his studio and his office. So if I sound any different, that is because I am not in my normal space. And if you say I sound better, that tells me I will have to go out and spend money, which please don't please just say you sound fine. You sound exactly like you do at home. And there's no reason to spend any more money on anything else other than pens and maybe paper. Jay, you sound absolutely glorious at home. There's no need to spend any money on anything else other than maybe pens, not paper. You already spent a lot of money on paper, so you don't need to do that. I don't want to spend too much money on paper. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I like the I like the message in chat to stop spending money. That's great. That's a very good job. What about you, Kathy? I'm giving a shout out to the incredible team over at Cotton Bureau. Stay tuned. We have some exciting things coming up. And in order for that to happen, we have a very, very special, like connection with Cotton Bureau. They have to work some magic and wiggle their fingers to let things happen for us to do what we're going to do. And they have been so kind and gracious and generous. And the best part is, is they will get to send a little bit of love with everything that is bought in the future. When they eventually are able to get up, but they have arrived. The secret pieces of paper have arrived at the location. So we're getting closer. The egg is in the nest. I repeat, the egg is in the nest. Exactly. Exactly. All right. Looks like you have one more there. I do. And this is shameless self-promotion time. It has a new project. It is a weekly project. It is a weekly project that I am not doing on my own. And there will be no editing because I have been I have been told that these things are bad for my health. So I am doing a show called the Python Community News. If you are a programmer and you are into Python, this is the show for you. This the idea was to create a programing show that didn't involve programing bits. So it is a news show where we talk about the news and events happening around the Python community. No PIP installs required. I will say that even though the topics are from the perspective of two people who write Python in their day to day, I think anybody that works in tech can learn from the topics that we bring up. In the last we've done two episodes now and it's weekly. It's launched. It goes out every Friday at three p.m. Pacific Time, six p.m. Eastern. And while Kathy, when I say I got to flex my automation muscles. Oh, my goodness, it was so good. I'm so happy is so automated. We we record the show using topics that we gather during the week that are all compiled into show notes, a newsletter and a blog post. And it requires zero editing from us that we just have to hit the button and press go. And it's like all the things made. And some of it is code that I wrote. And some of it is using code that I've been working on for years. So I am so like stoked for this project. Obviously, we're in the early days, so we are. We're still trying to grow and get the word out. So, yeah, if you're a programmer and that sounds like your jam, Python Community News, all one word dot com is the website. And there you can get a link to the archives and newsletters and podcasts, the other bits. So I'm doing a thing, but I'm doing a thing the way that I would always want to do it. Amazing. So are you planning on talking about other snakes at all or strictly pythons? We're actually going to be talking about rubies and gems and Java, which is both a country and a nickname for coffee. But yeah, but no rattlesnakes or, you know, cotton mouse, cotton heads. No arrowheads, cotton mouse. I don't know my snakes. I really, I really need to do more research on snakes, I think. I just like the one viper that has the eyelids because they they just look really silly. So I lied. I actually have one more shout out. This is the the season of studio photos for my dancers. And I got to take all the photos of my kids dance studio, their competition team. But more importantly, I got to help like support one of the dancers in high school who is taking photos of the high school team and each of their individual like headshots and dance poses and group photos. I stopped by as a joke to be like, haha, how dare you take photos of each other without me? It's, you know, against the rules. But and so they were nervous that I was going to, you know, take it over. But of course not, because this isn't my photo shoot. This isn't I'm just here to support. And I'm very glad that I was there to help, because the photographer's camera died in the middle. And that was a really stressful moment. But I still had my other camera in the car. So we were able to get things covered, taken care of. They did an incredible job. I'm so proud. And it's it's fun to to remember those early stages of learning things where you don't know everything, where it's not, you know, by rote, how you're you're OK, pose like this, do this, do that. And it kind of helped to refresh my memory, because I've been a photographer now for like 14, 15 years, something like that. So it was really nice to. Remember that joy of learning new things and getting to help someone else is also really nice. I just had this conversation with Brad earlier about the experience that we got to do. Folks, check out the Panatic streaming YouTube channel. Apparently, the YouTube there will be a YouTube video up of me with Brad doing things, but the. Kathy, have you like sushi, right? I love sushi. Perfect. Are you familiar with the phrase omokase? Uh, it tickles something in my brain, but I'm not 100 percent sure why. So omokase is like this experience where with communication with the chef, the chef prepares a series of plates for you. Yes, yes. I got to do that with pens today. And it was it was this moment of me being a pin nerd for several years and understanding kind of like. The why I liked pens a certain way, but not knowing the technical aspects of them and not knowing the depth of all of the penness that is like the knowledge that Brad has. So my goodness, it was it was literally like, OK, try this pen. This is a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah pen. And I'm like, oh, cool. Oh, this. Yeah, I don't. This thing tapers at the end. Really weird. I don't know if I like that. OK, so you want this type of pen? Sure. OK, so then try this pen. It's other blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then I was just like this. This was amazing. So by the end of it, I was able to get like I was able to look at like three different pens from like three different price ranges and three different nib styles. And I understood what nib sizing was and things like that. And it was it was this moment of just like, this is what it feels like when you have the knowledge of something and you get to share that experience with someone else in such an intimate way. And I feel like that's something similar to what you were able to do of like letting them have that experience, but also being able to work with them in the same. And there's a question in chat that says, if I try to stub nib, I am actively using a stub nib for the first time today. So this is like, yes, so many. Yeah, there's so much that's happening in this space that I I love that the topic that we're bringing today really hits on that. But I think before topics never mind, Kathy, this is your show. You know, yeah, we are so thankful for everyone in our community and all of the absolutely amazing things that they do. And because of that, we want to invite you to join the relay FM community. You can go to relay dot FM slash membership or go straight to relay dot FM slash conduit to become a member of conduit. And then part of that joyous membership perk is to come hang out in the discord with us, which right now we have several of our favorite conductors. You're all my favorites. Don't tell anyone else in the in the chat with us. And so they can ask questions, make jokes, you know, get confirmation and clarification on things. It's just a great space to be supportive and lovely. And I just love recording this show with them hanging out with us. It just makes it so super special. So thank you to all of our members and all of the members of Relay FM switch on directly. And I think it's time for a connection check. Zip. Oh, wait a second, Jay. How did you do? There we go. Jay, how did you do with your connection? So my connection last week was I'm working on a fancy work job project and I am playing the role of project manager slash coordinator slash owner. Like all the this is my project for me to do good slash bad slash whatever. And I am my my connection was to schedule all of the interviews that I needed to have with people. And would you believe I have scheduled all of the interviews except for one? And that person I reached out to and they did not get back to me. So like this is this is like not on me. But I've not only scheduled all of the interviews that I've actually had. Most of them, there are only two interviews left to be had and they'll be had tomorrow and Thursday. So green all around. I was able to come up with my questions, do my initial calls. And I've even. Pushed myself to not take too much time, which is an interesting concept for someone who does a podcast for a living and we try to hit certain time points. Normally, I would be like, yeah, this will take an hour. And I realized that it'll take as much time as I give it. So I said, this will take 30 minutes. And even some of the people being interviewed were like, do you think that's enough time? And I was like, yes, we will. We will make it enough time. Amazing. I'm so proud of you. Well done. What about you? So I have an orange circle, but it's OK. So I still have boxes in the front room that need to be unloaded. However, I have done several of them. Put away. But more importantly, I've gotten into a pattern of doing more like house things throughout the day instead of like, OK, it's now I'm done working. I am going to clean the house and then I get tired. And the idea of clean the house is such a big. Big overwhelming experience, shall we say, which means that I just don't do that. So instead, I've been kind of doing little things throughout the day. Like this morning, while I was waiting for coffee to go, I cleaned out the like the little coffee nook and I transferred our coffee syrups into fancy little like glass jars. So they're pretty and like just kind of doing these things. So it's it's progress in a different way. But it's OK to have an orange circle because it didn't complete the connection. And instead, I am making it, I guess, a bigger connection, a bigger journey and being aware of that. So that's fantastic. To me, I'm very happy with not with where I am. I like it. And I like that. Did you originally say that you were going to do all of it or you were just going to do some you were going to start doing it? Because I think I said that I was going to take care of all of the boxes in the front room. OK, OK. Well, I mean, yeah, I think that. That's definitely one of those feelings of you. You you've made the attempt, you put forth the effort. So, yeah, no, totally home run. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So let's jump into our conductors. So Deborah has a big green checkmark. She booked her flights and hotel for our cross-country trip to go to my cousin's wedding and see family members. I am so excited for you, dear soprano of the show, to have that trip and hang out with friends. Yay. Waterbriin, the hydration of the show says, I've been learning about riding the wave Sunday. I had the idea of taking responsibility, click in a whole new way. And I'm finding freedom in that concept because it's allowing me to need things in order to follow through with my responsibilities. That realization is a swaging my feelings of guilt at having needs. I think any time you can use the word of swaging, absolutely a green check. So way to go. I also definitely did not time the like who was doing which connection to not have to say that word. All right. Our favorite train enthusiast of the show, Railzi, has a big green heart with the airplane taking off emoji all packed and ready to go. As you're reading this live, I am in an airport hotel before I fly. And when you'll hear it released, I'll have arrived. I love the fact that it's like timed with our recordings and releasing. That's so much fun. The checklist was a great idea. And thanks, Jay, for that private help in DMS. Absolutely. I always tell people DMS are open if you are a relay FM member and you have thoughts and opinions because I will have them back and we can share them and we can hopefully come up with somebody being helped. Like Sof, our oracle of the show, who has a red circle and they did not start writing on any papers. Book promotion stuff got very overwhelming and will stay overwhelming for three weeks. But they'll get back to papers when they have the headspace. I get that, Sof, and I totally understand that you are you're in the midst of like big things happening. And sometimes big things happening mean like especially the unknown. Yeah, it's hard to plan anything when you're really not sure how involved or not involved certain tasks will be. Yeah, exactly. And so you may have a red circle, but not from a lack of trying, but from the world coming in and taking over for very exciting things. But also it's stressful. So, yeah, well done, Sof. All right, Ponderers, our newest conductor. Their first connection check is here and there of the show name is the Lassophile, which stands for or means a person who loves the sea. I definitely got clarification on how to pronounce it. So we're good to go. So their connection check is having power listened through the show. My first connection was to name my system and I took a cue from Jay. It's called the TLC system. One of the patterns I've developed because of bipolar, too, is believing that I can't finish a project unless I can sit down and do it all at once. That I'll lose the thread or give up or never get it done. My new system is designed to help me work on incremental progress as a practice and get better at it. Or to put it in other words, I should it should help me not go chasing waterfalls and to get me more used to rivers and lakes plus side. Whenever I need a reminder, I can put on the death cab for cutie cover and feel grounded, focused and ready to take on the world incrementally, of course. That is the perfect first connection. Not just because you named your system, which is awesome, but you wove in a great song. And I we're so excited to have you here and so excited that you have named your system. So well, brick and done. And are and also thank you for reaching out to me as well with some great feedback and some questions and stuff. I I feel bad because I have only gotten through about half of it and I need to get through the rest of it and I will. I will make sure I do that. Anyway, our sloth of the show on canoe says connection check. Green Circle job applied for festival applied for. I don't expect to hear back on an interview for the job for a few weeks more because stuff be slow. I'm pretty sure we'll we'll be on stage in October. The committee is figuring out where Huzzah. That's awesome. I cannot wait. And I'm looking forward to the the bootleg album to to make it to my door. Just you know how to reach me for my address and things. Absolutely. All right. Our blue dragon of the show, Sky, has a connection check of a of a blue heart, which we all know is really green. They successfully celebrated the number of years of their life. Most closely approximating a positive integer. Now, if I was a math nerd, I would know what that meant. Instead, I'm just going to say happy birthday. Our owl of the show, Kate, says connection check. Sorting is a green circle. Started sorting the everything in my room of sorting all my clothes and getting rid of the old ones that are never worn, which feels great. Also started the sorting of some of the other stuff, which will be an ongoing project. The CV portfolio and website task is also a green circle. I'm still in prep. I'm still in the prep stage for this. Nothing finished yet, but I did start as my connection required. I got a list of images that need tweaking that I'm working on through the moment. So making progress and then long term follow up. Huzzah got my results for my resubmission yesterday. Passed it this time around. Got an overall grade of a merit for the masters. I don't know what that means, but it sounds fancy. They'll keep reading because they'll tell you all about it. Hey, hey. You shouldn't interrupt me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. Can you forgive me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry to give you even with them capping the resit grade at the pass mark. Possible grades are pass merit and distinction. OK. I like it. This all sounds cool. And also merit for the masters. I still say that's the it just sound fancy to me. It does. It sounds like you have a parade coming before and after you with like extra the super fancy long, you know, horn with the flags that hang off of it. Married for the masters. Visualizing that. And instead, we're going to move on to the nameless of the show. Robert was a connection check of a green square. We are eight days till the wedding. All seems to be locked in. Who? Who? Who? Oh, my gosh. So by the time the next episode comes, it'd be a completely new person married. Amazing. I'm so excited for you, Robert. And I cannot wait to hear all about it. And our last conductor connection for the show. No, no. There's no. You're right. You're right. You're right. Yeah. My last conduct reading for the will be a jumbo or hello. The show connection check green square, green square, green square. We got married. Did you do 100 percent? The best day of my life was amazing to spend time with all my friends and family and get to stand up and tell the most important person in my life how much I love them and be with them forever. I am pumped. This is this is the season. This wedding season here at Conduit. And we are totally here for it. We are pumped. We are prepped. And we are so excited for all of the new conduit couples like this was all are doing. We know, right? We totally, totally. It's it's because of us, obviously. Absolutely. And our incredible hello, the show put a photo of their wedding day in the live stream chat. So excited. They both look absolutely gloriously happy and just a beautiful scene. We're so we're so excited for you. And us. No worries, Robert. Your wedding is coming up soon. And we're so excited for you to try to ask as Jumbo the the all the stress and all of that stuff. It's worth it on that day. Yes, for sure. All right. For reals now, the final conductor of this episode is from Scott, our guitarist of the show Green Circle. We are very close to being completely unpacked. It's starting to feel like home. Yay. Having been here a year, we are not unpacked. So I'm very jealous and excited for you. So well done, Scott. You I was going to throw the shade out there, but instead, I will just share a very wonderful message that this month is September, which means it is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. And for the fourth consecutive year, the relay FM community is rallying together and again to support the life saving mission of St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, finding cures and saving children. Did you know that it is estimated that more than 400000 children worldwide develop cancer each year and nearly half of them are never diagnosed. In the United States, more than four out of five children survive cancer. But in many developing countries, that statistic is reversed. Fewer than one out of five diagnosed with cancer will live. The most significant predictor of whether a child will survive cancer is where the child lives. That's why in March of 2018, St. Jude became the first and only World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Childhood Cancer. The goal of the WHO Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer is to raise the survival rate of six common childhood cancers to 60 percent by 2030. Last December, St. Jude and the World Health Organization launched the global platform for access to childhood cancer medicines. It aims to provide free chemotherapy medicines in the next few years as to as many as one hundred and twenty thousand children around the world with cancer. Childhood Cancer Awareness Month is an opportunity for us to come together to fight against childhood cancer, and together we can make a big impact. This year, you can support Relay FM for St. Jude campaign in multiple ways. As always, we invite you to make a donation. Donors who make an individual gift of sixty dollars or more will receive a digital bundle, including a wallpaper and Mac OS screensaver pack. Donors who make an individual gift of one hundred dollars or more will receive a set of stickers in addition to the digital bundle. If your employer offers a matching gift program, then fill out the form at St. Jude.org slash relay to have that match also credited to the campaign. And new for this year, if you want to get more hands on you can now start your own fundraising campaign to help us reach our goal while earning exclusive relay FM merch. Fundraisers who raise one dollar or more will receive an exclusive St. Jude limited edition of the relay FM challenge coin. And fundraisers raising two hundred and fifty dollars or more will also receive a unique desk mat featuring the cartoon heads of the relay FM co-founders, which I hope is banging in the chat right now. Please go to that. That's sorry. The URL is messed up. You go to St. Jude dot org slash relay to donate and to find more about fundraising and mark your calendars for September 16th for the fourth annual podcast. The fun relay FM co-founder Stephen Hackett and Mike Hurley will be back together at St. Jude's campus to host an eight hour variety show featuring many relay FM hosts and special guests. That's September 16th from 12 to 8 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time at Twitch dot TV slash relay FM. Once again, please go to St. Jude dot org slash relay to learn more and donate. Let's cure childhood cancer together. And one of the amazing new ways is with the sub campaigns right now. I'm so excited for them. They're incredible. There are currently 94 sub campaigns that all go straight to St. Jude and a community that started right here in the relay FM switch on Discord has created a widget in an app for the fundraiser. And it should be released, I think, by the time this publishes. If not, I apologize. Please forgive me. But one of the cool things that comes that is coming down the pipe is a discover a random fundraiser button. And so I thought on this episode, I would click that button and find a fundraiser and donate it to it. So what do you think, Jay? Do it. All right, here we go. Let's see what it is. Yeah, it's on test flight. We'll get the link. Thank you, Tony, for sending that. I don't know how it all works. It's all way too smart for me, but that's OK, because I have incredible people that do the learning and knowing for me. So I'm going to hit the button and we're going to donate to Eric Linder's fundraiser and is it the fundraiser? I will put that link in the show notes. So if you want to donate to the randomized fundraiser that popped up that I will be donating to, you can do that, too. So we can love bomb with conduit donations. But of course, I'm just going to keep it open on my phone and and donate after we record because I'm a professional. And we're going to talk about some exciting things instead of listening to me fill out the form and put in numbers and information. Because that doesn't sound like very good podcasting, but who knows? Who knows? Instead, let's put. Oh, good idea. Put it in the chat. Thank you, Jumbo, for being very, very smart. I'm going to put it in the chat here real quick. Well, Kathy is putting it in the chat. I just want to say that I I am happy to be a part of an organization that does this every single year. I mentioned last year during the podcast that we had a family friend that received, you know, health, you know, help from St. Jude. And sadly, their daughter was the the one in five in the U.S. that that didn't make it. But they were still so very thankful of the time that they got to have with their daughter. And when I'm I'm not going to be able to do that, with their daughter. And when I mean that of when you think about that, you it's really hard to be thinking about working and paying bills and doing all of those things while also trying to figure out hospital bills and medical bills and all this stuff for tests and chemo and things like that, while also dealing with the emotional stress of a sick child. As a parent, I can definitely understand at least the sick child part, but I can't imagine the pain and that they had to go through. But I do know that it would have been significantly harder. And they were ever so thankful of the time that they got to have at St. Jude because it allowed them to focus and cherish those moments that they had with their little one. So, again, it's it's always sad when when these things don't in the way that you want them to. But it is amazing that there are organizations that take the ability to give you that time that you have, that time that you will cherish and that you will hold on to forever instead of having to worry about that among so many other things. So this is definitely an organization that I support. My wife and I usually make matching donations, so we will be doing that. And also, I'm happy that Conduit this year is going to be hoping to do something special as well in support of this. Yeah, you may notice on the fundraising page, when we reach one hundred and fifty thousand dollars raised, we will be having a Conduit co-working hour. So we have a couple of things planned, but a little sneak peek to our Conduit listeners here is you're going to hang out with Jay and I while we work. Now, that may not sound like it's exciting. We'll see. But the biggest thing is, is we're going to be hanging out together and working on whatever project you want to do. It'll be a little bit of a Pomodoro style. So we're going to be doing a little work, doing some stretching together or maybe like just a mindfulness or something. We don't know. It's up in the air, but you can hang out with us. We'll have it on a Twitch account. I'm pretty sure it's going to be on Jay's because he knows how to work all of the magic. And we're really excited for this. And it might be a test drive for something fun coming in the future, too. Maybe Kathy can use that time to get those boxes taken care of. OK, listen. Yes, except that would be hard to do on a stream. And you know what? We'll figure it out later. It's fine. It's fine. So, Jay, we had to spoke on the phone to each other twice yesterday. Yeah. And that was really fun. And one of the things that we did was trying to figure out what to talk about on this episode. Huh? Yeah. And and the topic we came to was one that that was interesting, because I think it I think it'll mean something different to everybody. As we as we kind of mentioned, this is like the season of folks getting married. This is the season of people going back to school. This is the season of people launching a book. And for me, this is the season of being with my parents in Georgia right now, hanging out with them for the next month and also trying to work as we thoroughly consider the idea of relocating back to the state for, you know, family, personal reasons, but trying to get all of the pieces of the puzzle put together. And when I tell you that it is hard to like figure out, how do I even record a podcast as I'm, you know, sharing this this house with a bunch of other people and all these things happening? Luckily, I knew that there was a a pen addict, you know, nearby for me to say, hey, hey, friend, can I can I borrow your studio? That that one of being a big help. But before we jump into all my stuff, Kathy, what is this season for you? This is the season of back to school, back to busy schedules and busy weekends with other things getting planned, but also like a lot of big changes in my personal business coming in, making things we talked about a little bit before on a previous episode where I talked about like my solo retreat and concentrating on unicorning. And so it's now in the implementation process. So so kind of a season of change, a season of like foundational rebuilding almost and just kind of learning and growing the way that it always is. But it feels very, feels very difficult right now. It feels kind of scary to to be doing the things. And so I think a future topic will be like this this feeling of fear that I currently have. But it's fine. And we're not going to talk about it right now. And so we're going to kind of talk about what like how to transition to a new season and whether that is a like fall season and winter, spring and summer, or if it's a longer period of time or even a shorter period of time, you know, it's kind of helping to like identify it as like what this is in whatever way that works. So if you want to have I've seen a lot on like Instagram, people calling it their era. So in the like the Taylor Swift mode of, you know, this is my reputation era. This is my 1984 era type of vibe. And I like that, too. But we kind of wanted to talk about like that awareness and how to give yourself permission to live in that and not and do your best to not let it overwhelm you because because change is hard. Change is difficult. Oh, Sky made a point. It's almost new iPhone season, which it will be. I phone season when this episode publishes. So that's cool. I think it'll be the day before preorders go go out. Hypothetically. And I think about that, too, of it could be a season of new things coming into your life in terms of new technology. It's interesting that, Kathy, if you remember, most of this year has been me waiting for the fanciest of technologies to arrive. And then it got here and I got to use it for like a month and a half, two months. And then now it's back at home and I'm here. Now, that being said, I do have a fancy new laptop, but it's not the the most powerful list of devices. So it is, you know, an M2 MacBook Air. And, you know, I did I tried to prepare for this being in this exact moment when I made that purchase. It was very much me saying, I know that I'm going to be traveling, I'm going to be gone. And I either have to be OK with lugging around a Mac studio and a 5K monitor, which that that's not no, that's that's not the answer ever. But I instead said, OK, let me get a device that I can use that I know is going to be my on the road device for the next year or two. And and I was thinking about that in the preparation stage. Do I get the, you know, less than a terabyte or do I get the terabyte? Do I get the extra RAM? Do I get all these things? And and in my case, the answer was yes on a lot of those. But it wasn't because of, you know, me just wanting the best of devices. It was, oh, no, this is going to have to be the big device for me for at least a month, if not more, because of, you know, just getting things transition back and forth into systems is always hard. But there was also the idea of being open and, you know, with my teammates. And hey, I know that normally my team, you know, normally we've been doing this. I've been live streaming like three times a week right up until this. And it was like it was all for the hey, I'm going to be leaving soon, but I want to make sure that I'm putting these systems in place now so that when I go on the road, that live show that we do still has to happen. So how do I make sure that that's the best possible live show that I can do and that when I get back to, you know, my house in California, I can say, cool, let's just continue running like like we never missed a step. Right. Yeah, because this is a huge upheaval of your day to day. And yet you are still expected to function. Yeah. The world doesn't care where you are. You have to do your things. And you're you're really. You're lucky that the situation was able like. It benefited from. Getting to do that prep work, you know, you could. It wasn't last minute, you weren't you didn't buy the Max Studio and then suddenly, oh, by the way, you have to go now and use an old laptop that barely functions to be able to, you know, do your work while you're gone for an entire month. You know, this these things are. It's interesting the difference that being able to plan for something as opposed to having it dropped in your lap can can. Adjust almost even just adjust your mental state like. I don't know about you, Jay, but if I can know something is coming. I'm more ready for it when it comes. Yeah. And it's easier to process. It's easier to take advantage of. It's easier to. You know, have it have a good outcome because you're not as scared out of your mind because you don't know what it is or you don't know how to handle it. You don't know what to do, how to manage it. And I think it helps that you do travel a lot, not for this long. But being able to kind of have an idea of being able to. Uh. What you need to function at a different location is not new to you. Yeah, it's it's definitely a feeling of. I've prepared for this. I it's it's like practice before the game, like that's that's the feeling right now is that, you know, you aren't going to be able to plan for all the things we have. Flash flood warnings this entire week. So like that was not in my plan at all. But I would much rather be. Able to spend more time working around, you know, water being very, very high than having to do like, oh, I don't even know where I'm going to work now. And like all these other things. And on top of that, the rain just keeps falling. So it it it seems helpful that the the thought that did go into it made made life so much easier. And and I want to ask you, you know, it's the time of going back to school. Give me like one good and one maybe different. Look at what the season means for you. Yeah, so one of the the. One of the things that change is that because. Tiny soup. Catches the bus at 7am, I have to make sure that they're awake. You know, it's a basic it's a basic thing. They're they're 13. They're pretty good at, you know, waking up with their their alarm and stuff. But I still have to make sure that they are actually awake because they need they can't miss school and their bus comes. And it's not a huge imposition most of the time. If I do need if they do miss the bus and if I do need to take them to school. But. I would really rather not. Have to deal with that. Especially if I have things, meetings or something in the morning. So what that means is I actually have to get out of bed at six. As opposed to what I have been doing this summer, which. Between six and seven at some point, I'm awake and I'm out of bed and I'm and I'm. You know, doing the things and one of the one what this means is starting my morning routine earlier. And. Actually, having to start it earlier, instead of just turning off my alarm and then I'll get up when I get up. But I'm going to be working towards continuing to solidify my morning routine to be more purposeful so that I have. More time to myself in that morning me time because I'm awake at six. So it will allow me to embrace the fact that I absolutely have to get out of bed at six. And own it and do all of the things that I want to do. Now that I have that that time before I get started to work. So instead of just jumping in and saying, oh, I'm going to do this. I am. It's, you know, six a.m. I've woken up tiny soup. It's time to sit at my desk and work. I'm going to use that hour. To do more things for me in the morning. So I don't know exactly what that looks like yet, but it'll be really interesting to transition that one of the good things also is the fact that. Having a solid day to day plan like every day, this is going to happen during the week, you know, every Monday, every Tuesday, every Wednesday, having that solid in place helps plan things a little bit differently, a little bit better, but it also gives. My child, the structure that they really need to thrive. So we're all excited and nervous about this new season and ready for it to kind of go and be here because we did a lot of prep work to not quite ordering new computers level, but figuring out like starting alarm clocks, starting, you know, timing issues and whatnot. Thankfully, their bus gets here about 15 minutes later than they did. Last year, so they get a little bit of more sleep, but yeah, it's kind of nice. I also love that for you. I know that like when when the the tiny soup is doing all of the things, that's when the season start up and you really get to flex the like again, those photography skills. And like the tick tocking things and like all the other amazing work that you do like for the collective group of I mean, would they all be gazpacho's? I don't know. I don't know. The chicken noodle, you've got tomato and split pea. Yes, split peas over in the corner. I don't know what's happening there, but I feel like those seasons, I mean, as as stressful as they may be or as they may get, like I think focusing on all what are all the bad things that could happen like isn't really the way to do it. I think that there's a lot of good. I know that a pod pod friend of the show, Find My Dragon, like that whole thing, like, you know, find my dragon. Like that whole arc is back into like getting into school, getting back into the the spirit of it and go listen to that show because that show is great. But one of the things that came up was like seeing the difference between the first year for the smaller or the younger dragon and the continuing year and how they differed and what was coming up. I think that there's, you know, I've been talking about all the unexpected as this thing to prepare for and, you know, be worried about and have on the front of your mind. But I also think that there's a level of what exciting can come from the unexpected. I got my hair done. Like I like my hair looks I mean, it looks about it looks different, but it looks great. And like that wasn't a thing that I was planning to do. And I'm like, now I'm excited for how the rest of the trip is going to go because it's like it's already starting off really well. And I look forward to not just the, you know, what happens if a tree falls and hit my mom's car while I'm driving it or something. Because then I've got two problems. And one is a really mad mom. Yes. Like what are all of the good things that are going to come from, you know, doing this and doing this the way that we've done in like, like you said, a month is a long time. Yeah. The longest that like our little one's been on vacation. Our little one flew for like the second time and she wasn't scared at all. It was so great. She's so excited to fly. And it just warmed my heart, because now that means that if I go to places and they're short trips, I can like take her with me. So like that just opens the door for so many things. So like while it is a season that required a lot of preparation, there's like so many wonderful, unexpected things that that also. Yeah, it's it's also the season for the podcast, a thon, which is amazing. And I'm super excited, but I'm also behind what I normally would like to do. So last year was the first year that I did the founders quiz. Game thing. Well, I'm doing it again this year on, you know, September 16th from what, 12 to 8 p.m. Pacific or Eastern time. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely remembered that. The problem is, is I don't have the questions yet. Don't tell Stephen. So I probably should get on that. I probably should make the Google form like I did last year, because, oh, my goodness, the Discord had tons of great questions and being able to to use them to guide. I know, Kate, I'm sorry. I'm going to use your incredible historian skills again. Hopefully, I know you're super busy, though, so we'll see. We'll get it figured out. It'll be fine. It's fine. Everything's fine. It's going to be fine. Yeah, I I'm nervous. I'm less nervous than I was last year, because last year was the first year that I did it. But doing it this year, it's almost it's it's more scary in a different way because I haven't. Because I don't have the fear, I'm also. Not as prepared, if that makes sense, so. I mean, I know what my connection is going to be now, so it's fine. Everything's fine. Everything is fine. It's going to be fine. So speaking out, never mind, this is your show. You do. You do the segues. Are we ready to segue? I wasn't sure if there's anything else you wanted to chat. Um, I mean, I I'm really interested in hearing what other folks is seasons of are and kind of what they're excited about, what they're trepidatious about. You know, it I think that. No matter what the thing that I have just consistently learned is everything is scary. Yeah. Eventually, it becomes less scary. It's still scary. It's just slightly less scary. And there's a great, you know, the great way to solve that is to just go through it and try to have as much fun in the process because it'll help you forget how scared you are going into it. Yeah, that's that's definitely a feeling that I am. I am trying to live more and more each day of everyone keeps saying all these scary things that involve my name. And I go, well, I guess that this is the season of me just showing off. I guess I don't know. I'm going to do whatever I do. And I'll be terrified the entire time. But so far, I've had nothing but fun. Gay, terrified the whole time, but having nothing but fun. That sounds like a great, great ending or goal. Sounds like a good roller coaster. Yeah. Yeah. I'm riding the conduit. Our connectors are terrified the entire time. Oh, my goodness. Love it. I love it. All right. So what I think you're saying is when our conductors give us their connection checks, maybe they should tell us what season of life they're in as well. Yes. Do that. Yeah. Yeah. If you if you want to make it cortex style, the season of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like that's that's fine. If you just want to say, you know, I'm not into that whole thing. But this has been a moment of of this happening for me. Then I think that's cool, too. Yes, absolutely. If you don't like seasoning, that's cool. Each you can absolutely enjoy your plan. Chicken. But no, no, no. Seasoning chicken. I'm sorry. Yes. But don't wash it. Don't. Yeah. Don't wash your chicken. Yeah. Season it. Yes. All right, Jay, what is your connection for the next fortnight? To make sure all the conductors have more than salt and pepper for seasoning on their chicken. That might be difficult. Oh, I read something that makes me OK. I'm not I'm not going to ignore that comment. Yeah, you're good. You're good. OK. My goal is to. Hmm. I want to. I've got some big projects for the rest of the year that don't involve me speaking that much, but one of them is me speaking. And it is me giving my first keynote presentation when I return from my trip. I won't have that done because I'm only doing or I'm not doing half. I don't know. I don't know how half the work, although I'm working with someone else on that. My connection will be to. Have started on all. Three of the big projects by the next conduit. Ooh, I'm not I'm not given a I'm not given a how much just just start them, because knowing me, I will I will push myself to do more and more than I had planned. And I think if I just start, that'll be the biggest help there. I think that's a great idea. Now, write that in the connection thing. So I give I know I'm so needy, but this way, I don't have to listen through to the episode and write it in the document because I forgot what you were going to do. No, of course not. I would never do such a thing. Instead, we're going to distract shiny over here. My connection is going to be to have the best time at the podcast on how about that? Because everything's going to be great. Sorry, I'm writing down the projects that I'm supposed to be doing. But not in the document, are you using one? Did you steal Brad's flavor or flavor? Yeah, flavor. This is what happens when I read it. Did you writing it down in my notebook so that I can have it for myself? Because let's be honest, we're not opening this up again until we have to. It's true. Oh, wow, Tony, that actually looks good. I'm going to send that, maybe buy it for my child, who we did. So there's the the Bean Boozled game with the with the terrible and good flavored jelly beans. There is now a version of it where they're super, super spicy. And the first one my kid tried was the hottest one. And so we have actually found something that is too spicy for them. They were. Is that a is that a yay? Right. I mean, I don't care either way, but it's any time they like have something spicy or sour, it's like, oh, whatever. Like, blah, this isn't spicy at all. And I'm over here, like, I'm like, oh, I'm going to have to do this. Where black pepper is sometimes too spicy for me. Yes, Tony, tiny soup is a major spice fiend. Like they will sit and eat talkies like their bread. I don't know. That's not even a spicy thing. That's just the talkies are bad. Yeah. So I was very excited. I mean, I'm ignoring you there. I was very excited to find something that was too spicy for them. So I can't wait. I can't wait to hear about all these connections. Yeah. So would you like to start? Yeah. Our soprano of the show, Deborah says next connection. So a custom cross body bag to carry on the plane that has the exact pockets I need for carry on items like an iPad, Kindle, iPhone, wallet, et cetera. That sounds awesome. And now I just wondered, is Etsy like a play on the word, et cetera? Oh, sorry. I had a moment there. Etsy, et cetera. Is it is it like the same thing? Because my first my first mental thought was like, oh, you should do that and put it on Etsy and I will buy one. And then I was like, wait, I'm giving people work. I'm not supposed to do that. Don't give people work unless they ask for work ideas. All right. Next up, our hydration of the show, Waterbrine, their new connection is to ask myself and others, what do I slash you need if I can provide it in a sustainable and reasonable response? Well, responsible manner within my boundaries do so. I love this because so often our connections are very internally focused and this is a way that can really help other people. So I love I love that so much. I'm so excited and I can't wait to hear your connection check. And then our train enthusiast of the show, Railsie says new connection, enjoy and make the most of the holiday. Decompress then back to planning in a way, my quality assurance vision for my new employer. OK, you got this. I look forward to hearing about your TPS reports and I hope that they will be especially more fun with your new stapler. Yes, just don't steal it from someone else's desk. All right. Our Oracle of the show, Sof, their new connection. I'm working on boundaries and systems, so I don't feel like I have to be in work mode every minute. The less good part of self-employment connection is to keep figuring out my system so that I can survive a very busy time. Sounds like you're in a busy season of life now, Sof. And instead of letting it be overwhelming, you are embracing it and using it to set up your foundational systems. So I'm super proud of you and I can't wait to hear how it goes. And then our the last file of the show, ponders, man, that you got to warm up for that word. That's like, I know. You got to. Oh, yes. It's good word, though. Brain dump my someday maybes. Jay and I can have it out someday. There you go. Um, and find a meaningful home for them. I have a deferred dates page that all of them go on to. And by all of them, I mean, there's only one thing on there that I put on there in the last six months. Anyway. This is a largely and this is largely inspired by a co-op reading of Barbara's shares, refused to choose, organized by the incredible Maddie that some of us are doing in the relay FM. So it's on Discord. You can find by going to the under it and become a member for five dollars a month to support conduit. It's seriously such a cool and welcoming community. And you'll be glad you join. Yes, this is an endorsement and a member plug inside a shout out inside a future connection. They won't all be like this or will they? Zine. Oh, ponders, you are clearly fitting in just fine. Our sloth of the show on canoe, their next connection is get back on the fitness train. The heat of summer and job busyness made me lazy. You're going to aim for at least eight workouts in the next fortnight. You can do it. Does our train enthusiasts of the show run the fitness train? Oh, maybe I see some connections happening. Our blue dragon of the show, Skye says, simple, survive the next two weeks of school without burning out. I endorse that. Mostly they need to do this by learning when to let themselves rest, but also might consider a change in the system. Sounds like you need to do a system check. I love it. Check. Amazing. All right. Our owl of the show, Kate, their new connection, continue both the sorting of my room and the work updating my CD portfolio and website, basically the same as last time, except not the same as last time, because you know, now have a hold on. Let me scroll up. You now have a merit for the masters. So it's very different. A masterful merit at most. The nameless of the show, Roberts, has be patient for the wedding day. Do not let the what if stress me out. Trust all the planning and help from our loved ones will make a big make the big day go off of it out a hitch. Well, I almost butchered that pack for the honeymoon and also make sure as much as possible is left moving for our house and renovation. So I leave all the worries here while we're away. That that is excellent. Yes, absolutely. Enjoy the wedding. Enjoy the honeymoon and get put. Think about all that stuff when you get back. Definitely. All right. Our hello of the show, Jumbo, their new connection check is to relax and enjoy some time with his wife. How many times have you made my wife jokes? Because really now is the time to just lean in and and get them all out of the way before it's overwhelming and you get tired of it. I'm already tired of it. Never, never. And lastly, our guitarist of the show, Scott says new connection. The five K is coming up. Time to get back to training. Might I suggest having a conversation with a friend? I did a I did a five K walk while on the phone with someone. I don't know if you're walking or running. If you're running, conversation might be hard. If you're walking a good phone call can get you there. Absolutely. And if you would like to submit a connection, become a new conductor, you can do so on Twitter by tweeting at Conduit FM using the hashtag my conduit or in the relay dot FM switch on Discord with question mark my conduit. You can also hang out in the show follow up channel. And if you start the message with our conduit image, it will automatically all get put into our magical spreadsheet by the incomparable Matty V. So go ahead and visit relay dot FM slash conduit to become a member if you would like to become a member of conduit. I think we've promoted membership just a couple of times. And so now that that's over, hey, Jay, did we conduit? We can did it. In fact, I think we started a whole new season of doing it. I can't wait for the next time that we can absolutely conduit. OK, I'm out of stuff, so I'm just going to leave it there.
