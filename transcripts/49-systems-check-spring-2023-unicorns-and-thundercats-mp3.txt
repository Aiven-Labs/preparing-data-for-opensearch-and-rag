From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that likes to check into the spring. I am Jay and with me is our wonderful unicorn of the podcast, Kathy. And I want to also let you know this episode is brought to you by Micro.blog and Factor. It's also brought to you by our lovely superconductors. Visit I'm a Superconductor.com for more information, but more on that later. Kathy, how's it going? All right. So we're recording this live like we always do. We'll talk a little bit more about that in the future as well. But Jay, my calendar says April, today's April 27th. That's weird. Yeah, this is this is an out of time episode, not that we ran out of time, but it's an episode out of time in that we believe in proper work life balance. And because we believe in proper work life balance, you and I weren't the only two that that we're traveling for us this season, this month, next month, this slash next month. At some point in the future times. Yes. Our amazing editor is also going on some traveling and we want them to have the most fun as possible. And in order to do that, we have to make sure that we have our episode done so that you don't receive, you being the audience, any type of disruption in your normal conduit experience. But that does mean that for this episode, and we will have most likely reminded you in the episode before this, that yes, there won't be any connections or connection checks, Mostly because we believe we believe wobbly time you want to stop. I was having like we we tried to think about and figure out how we could get the connections to work. And my brain broke. I don't know about Jay's, but like, it just was not worth it to try and fight, you know, all of that. It just would be too confusing for everyone involved. And so we're deciding to just not do any connections for this episode at all. So what that means is the previous episode that you just heard, unless you're in the live show right now, but ignore ignore this part. If you're in the live chat, the previous episode you listened to two weeks ago. Your connection checks will be episode two weeks from now. So there will be a month long to work with that connection, which we will probably talk about on the show. We record it on Tuesday, which is four days from now. Five days, something like that. Maybe that episode can be about big connections. Oh, I like it. But yeah, that said, it was this episode will be coming out in the middle of May. It's going to be May. It's going to be May. I had to do it. So that is actually around the time that we normally do our systems check. So we just decided to do it a little early. It'll still come out around the same time and everything works out perfectly fine. So let's start by talking about what is Kathy, what is our systems check? Yeah. So if you listen to the show. Well, OK, let me start with this. If this is your first episode listening to us, welcome. We're so happy that you are here. And we're sorry for all the confusion. Yeah. And we're sorry that this is the first one because it's going to be bananas. But that's OK. If it's not your first episode, welcome back. And you'll know that we don't really talk about specific. Well, no, we definitely don't talk about Bruno, but we also don't talk about specific apps a whole lot or our systems. What we actually do to get things done, because really we understand that it doesn't matter. It like if something isn't working for you, you have to find something else, which is fine. Like, that's awesome. That's great. Keep working at it. But what works for me is not going to work for Jay and what works for Jay is definitely not going to work for me. And so in order to kind of give space for that, but also to bring awareness to the fact that it's OK and expected for your systems to change throughout the year, if you're on top of it, if you're paying attention and trying to be present with what you're getting done, it's important to take those moments to find out what's working, find out what's not working and see about trying something different. And so that's what this episode is. Yeah, we totally think it's valid that getting getting insider inspiration from others makes perfect sense. However, we don't want to be in a state of constantly switching, but we also don't want to be in a state of stagnation and trying the same thing just for the sake of doing it. And I know we kind of thought this is a great way to do it. It's also a reminder. You know, I we talked about our amazing tire metaphor, but it's also like a good time to check your tire pressure, check what's going on and see, you know, people that live in the north, they understand sometimes you have multiple sets of tires that you got to put on based on the terrain. So this is this is an excuse to take a break, go back, examine all the things that are happening, examining all the things that are coming up and make sure that you're you have the right tires for that situation. Hey, Jay, what what is the tire method? I'm glad you asked. The tire method is a great way for making decisions. And it's an acronym. So the T stands for time. Do you have time to do the thing in the requested period? I is your intuition. I think spidey senses are totally valid reason for declining an opportunity or accepting one. Do you have the resources required? And probably one of the biggest resources that we don't think about is just do you have the energy? And we will talk about this because energy is actually one of the the key points that I have in my systems check. But we'll talk about more about that later. So time, intuition, resources and energy. That is that is the tire that you should be checking before you tackle a new trail. Yeah. So now that we've gotten all the admin stuff out of the way, Kathy, how is your system? Does it have a name? I feel like you're in a permanent state of of the unicorn system. But what changes do you foresee coming? Yeah, so obviously, unlike Jay, I keep the same name because I am the unicorn and that is my system, regardless of what is underneath it and what's happening. My system is. Making some changes as I take ownership of some new projects. Now, don't get mad at me, Jay, because these these aren't really new so much as. Projects that I've been doing for a while, but at new levels. So I don't even say more, just bigger. Yeah, yeah, and more responsibility ownership, even if a lot of the responsibilities are the same, if that makes sense. So. We'll start with the most recent one in time in the time space continuum. So the reason that I am so tired today is I am still recovering from a convention this past weekend. Wednesday through Monday this past week, I was in Atlanta for Jordan Con, which is a Wheel of Time and Sci Fi and Fantasy Literature Convention with friends, some of whom I have been friends with for more than 21 years. So it's always nice to bond and connect with people. I have been on the staff since 2017 in a variety of different roles. And starting this year, I will be the communications officer, which means I will be in charge of the communications team for this nonprofit. That's a lot of work. I've been supporting the previous officer for a while for seven months, six, seven months or so. And she is now moving over to the operations side of things, which is great because her brain works perfect for operations. And I'm excited to kind of come into this role and fully take over it. And we're going to, you know, streamline some things, clean things up, kind of not burn everything to the ground. But the team has been led by this wonderful human for so long that it's nice with the systems for the team and with the systems for the officers and stuff to kind of take a fresh look and see how we can make things more efficient. Additionally, the leadership of Dragon Mount, which is the amazing company based around the Wheel of Time that is responsible for why I was lucky enough to be on the red carpet for season one premiere in London in 2021. That when it was? I think so. It was. Yeah. Yeah. Fall of 2021. November. I don't know. At some point. Yeah. In the past. We've been doing this show for so long. Oh, my gosh. I am now fully taking the leadership role over there. Jason is stepping down now that he's like the site has been around for 25 years and hitting that 25 year anniversary is kind of the reason that he's like, OK, I'm ready to to pass it on. And so I am starting the real leadership of that. So instead of doing the things that he wants to do, I'm able to kind of make changes. And once again, we're not burning everything to the ground so much as taking a look at the foundation and kind of seeing what's what's going on there. And then, of course, my real true unicorning, as they say, the unicorn sidekick, I have four amazing unicorns that work for me and for my clients. And we just got a rebrand logo thing. So I'm ready to implement that and kind of build that out and build a marketing strategy on top of, you know, everything else, including podcasting. So things are busy. And for those that might only think that you podcast on Conduit, no, you have three, four shows. Is that right? I mean, technically, yes. So Roboism is with Alex Cox and they are incredible. And their goal is to start doing more consistent episodes. So we're working towards that, which is great. I can sit here and talk about robots forever. And then I have and isms and mostly robots. And then technically, I have the Dragon Mount podcast, where it's a rewatch and discussion podcast about the about the television show. And I've been very specifically. Cultivating that to be just about the show and not making it a larger. Podcast, if that makes sense. So instead of trying to get weekly or or fortnightly episodes up, we're very specifically talk about. Just the television show, and it's been kind of nice because season two isn't out yet. So I haven't had to make those, but. Sometime this year, it will come out and we get to talk about it again. And then, of course, all of the fun episodes and one offs that I do over on the incomparable, which I'll be recording a show later today about the episode seven of Ted Lasso, which I'm very excited about. Such a good episode. That's not what we're talking about now. And then, of course, for our members here at Relay FM, switch on, I interview hosts about their whatever our members want to ask about. In an Ask Me Anything spotlight. Show. So, yeah, just a couple of podcasts, just a few. So that's that's kind of where you're at with all of like all of the things happening, the big changes happening. How are you? Are you trying to manage everything in one place? Are you trying to, you know, silo things off into their own systems, their own places and things like what's what's your strategy going into this season of of so many things? Yeah. So the main thing that I've realized is that I need an inbox that is universal and that is every everywhere. So that I don't have to worry about just putting my brain brain dumping down. I know it's important to be able to remember things. But. I. So I have multiple different like CRM things for different projects, different clients, et cetera. But I have discovered that I am using Todoist more. And having it be a not just a long term planning idea thing, but to gather things as they come up through the day and through. You know, I'll be working on one one project and I get a message or notification or an email or something about a separate one instead of going to. Like transitioning over and adding this task into something else, I will just put it into to to do it so that I'm like, OK, a couple of times through the day, I will clear out that inbox and put things where they need to be. I know some people use drafts for this. And so something that does work for my brain is what it needs to be. And oh, my gosh, my dogs are freaking out for no reason. Ophelia, come here, go back to sleep just because Jose. OK, let me let him out. I'll be right back. Sorry, Javier. This is why you should join the super awesome relay of them switch on membership. This is why you should join the super awesome relay of them switch on membership, because in the chat, I'm going to just go through. We have stickers. We have people asking to burn things to the ground. And then also what I would consider as definitely the like Jordan Peele application of like Kathy, if if she was going to be the star in in his next film, which I would think be called Nay instead of no. I'm available, Jordan. Give me a call. But yes, yes, yes, a thousand percent. Please, please. One, Kathy, please continue now that the dogs have calmed down, calmed down. So, yeah, this season of my life is definitely a little bit more bananas. And I'm. Finding that placing things like having just one place to enter and then being able to spread that out to wherever it needs to be done is already helping. This is fairly new with within the last couple of weeks. And yeah, it's it's interesting. And we'll see how it goes. So you said that drafts doesn't work. You've said to do is kind of works, right? More and more is going into to do is. Yeah, yeah, mainly because it's got the easy like entry into the inbox. So I don't have to choose where it goes so much because I'll know what I know, send contract means, because I'll know what's going on with whatever contracts are are needed. But I don't I basically just want to put in the task so it can slip out of my mind, but not be forgotten so that I don't forget what's supposed to happen. So things don't slip through the cracks because it can be dangerous if things slip through the cracks. You know, things can miss. Obviously, this isn't we're not doing brain surgery or rocket science or anything. So there's no life or death situations. But it is important for me to make sure that I'm doing what I need to do. And that includes, you know, making appointments for the family. And that includes making sure that I. Don't have to reschedule anything because something else came up. And so having a quick, easy task entrance like like text entering thing that goes to where it needs to go is really helpful. Got it. The thing that you you kind of threw in there of like kind of the life versus the work. That has been my biggest challenge in terms of like task management, because I don't think as much of like I try to separate the idea of tasks and projects, but I'm also not super in like engaged to the whole. If it takes more than one step, then it's a project. Right. No, it's just a very complex task. Like getting my you know, making sure my kid makes it to the dentist on time is not a problem. I mean, that might be a project, but like, you know, it's not a project. It's a task. Like at the end of the day, it is do the things that get the kid to the dentist that you normally do. Just do them early. But, you know, the space of, hey, I run this site or I'm a super important person. At this nonprofit, you have you know, this is this is an area and like I know like things, the app things does that where they try to segment between like projects, tasks and then areas. And unfortunately, things just doesn't work for me. But that's been like the the easiest. Are you are you segmenting your your stuff in any way? Like, I guess to put yourself in a different thinking mindset as you're looking at those or is everything just kind of peppered in with like, oh, you have this call and then you have this email that you got to send out. And then also you got to, you know, take Ophelia to the vet and you also have to clean up the, you know, you know, fluff the pillows on the guest bedroom or something as your mom might come in. Like, are you are you segmenting that out in any particular way? Are you just using like to do this like projects and then maybe nested projects or something for that? Yeah, I basically have my projects, which are my photography business, one of my clients, home, Jordan Khan, podcasts, another client, switch on my business as a whole and Dragon Mount. And those are the the segmented projects out. Other client projects tend to be like pretty not repetitive necessarily, but like it's often enough that I don't necessarily need to have a whole project in to do this because it's like one off things or whatnot. But as of who knows what might change in the future, but I just will slide it in there and add a due date and it's done. I'm not trying to add like steps in the task. It's it's got to be like. It's mainly just a reminder for me to do the thing if I have to sit and do more planning, that's fine, but it's not going to be done in to do this. This is more so the reminder to make sure that X, Y, Z happens. That makes sense. OK, yeah, that's that was like my big concern is I can't. I can't do the. Planning plus management in to do is and I definitely and we'll talk about my stuff like soon, but that's kind of where I'm at now is where I'm like, I really need. Something that's going to allow me to make plans, but do it in a way that I don't have to like do all my planning in one space and then also manage my tasks and other things in another place. And I've just I've just struggled so much, but I can like I said, I'll talk to that when it's my turn. So, yeah, with all of this things, with all of these things, I'm also trying to be very, very aware of downtime and making sure that I'm taking full advantage of that. So I am trying to have time for the weekends that are just for me, just for like doing some active relaxation, which means I might do fun projects. I might do, you know, I will still do the things around the house that need to happen. I'll be playing some video games, read some books, etc. And do my absolute best not to do work, even if I know I have a ton that needs to happen. It's important to get that that rest time in there as well. Totally. Hold on one second, Kathy. I'm sorry. And I'm also sorry. So now that it's Jay's turn to run around, how's everyone doing? I'm glad you enjoy my unicorn photos. They're some of my favorites. Maybe someday I'll do a summer unicorn version. I love the winter ones, though. The snow was so deep and fun. But I would probably need a summer level of like a summer weight onesie. I don't know if they make those. A summer weight onesie. That that sounds very, very interesting. Oh, I just thought of an amazing conversation that you and I can have about our membership episode. Oh, yeah. It all of the random disruptions have given me an idea for a game that we could play. But love that. Let's talk about that later. Was there was there anything with your system, the unicorn system, anything in particular that kind of stood out just as you were you were kind of I mean, you've mentioned to do this a few times, but was there anything else that stood out in your figuring out of all of this? Mainly how important I am still finding my daily bullet journaling, being able to sit down, write the date, write what's on my schedule with times and then be able to do like a slight brain dump slash just put everything down from whatever variety is of systems, looking at my calendar, whatever's going on, being able to place it all in my bullet journal and have my bullet journal sit out and just be there and be present and easy to see. And yeah, the analog tools are vital to my life. And yeah, and yes, Jay, I will say how important I am because that's what you thought I was going to say. And now I am saying it. So you're welcome. Yes, a thousand percent. I I genuinely thought the words were going to be how important I am. And that that was I mean, sure, please gloat on because you deserve it. But also just a look at. Is it good to have that level of importance in all of these things? And how are you managing the what I like to call the bus rule? Of that, like what happens if you get on a bus and go very, very, very, very far away for a long, maybe eternal period of time? How do all of those things around you get managed? And I often use that as a sign of if like everything just ends because you decided to board that bus, then like that might be an indicator of like, OK, I need to start delegating and like assigning people to continue on the things that I can. Obviously, you can't do that for everything, but, you know. Right. Right. No. And it's important, I think. So I have managed I have ended up being many people's number two for a variety of reasons. And so I'm kind of actively looking for somebody to be my number two in a couple different spaces so that I have somebody that I can rely on that is able to do the things that I need support in. And knowing that I cannot do all of it will not be able to do all of it myself means that I am going to be able to concentrate on what is needed to myself outside of the work things and what I can do to find someone that can assist me. Well, while you hold on, I got to yell at the dock again. So whatever you were going to say, go ahead. So for those in the chat, number two, definitely not a good number three in the kids next door timeline. But number two was was very effective in making sure that number one, I guess, in this case, being Kathy, would be thinking about how they do. All the things that they do. And yeah, I'm really excited for this idea that I had. So chat remind me that you have to do the idea. Oh, yeah. I love I love that email that you get in the middle of recording that says, hey, I know you're off this week, but you got to do this thing by the the end of the week. Otherwise, you'll be in trouble. And I'm like, ah, even when I have time off, I don't have time off. This episode of Conduit is brought to you by Micro.Blog. Blogging is still the easiest way to share stuff on the web.

So I'm going to do my best to do something similar. I love. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm laughing because you're the one that wrote down my layout. So you're welcome. I just I don't know. It worked well. I'm welcome. I also thank myself. This is great. Yeah. So. As like Kathy, I don't do nearly as a variety of things that Kathy does. I and I'm coming to that realization. I used to think that I was like extremely busy and like extremely like consumed with a bunch of random things. And then Kathy just threw down everything that that she was doing. And I was like, there's there's no way no way that I could I could handle all that. That being said, I, too, am recovering from attending an event, PyCon US, which is, you know, the the technology, the programming language that I'm a part of. We that just happened. I was in Salt Lake City for a week, and it was extremely rewarding, extremely exhausting. And now that it's over, I am kind of in this this period of rest until the next thing, which the next thing is in a month and a half. So it's like I've got a couple more days of resting and recovering and then getting ready for the next thing. That being said, I also spent the last few months planning for this event. So there's like this how I sit my hand. There's like this. Yeah, there's a weird like energy that. I don't have this big project. This big project is now gone and it won't be back until next year. See the episode about like preseason and offseason and other sports metaphors. We're definitely into the offseason. And the first step is relaxation. And then we won't be thinking we'll be doing like a breakdown of that stuff. And then after that, I don't have to think about it again until January of next year when we start getting ready to start planning all over again. And that's put me in like this weird spot where I've been doing so much and focusing so much on that, that I've been pushing things out until this time. And I've also gotten a lot better at saying no, which I'm really happy about. Excellent. Yeah, I've I've canceled things like I'm doing a lot. But also, I understand that, like, as this episode is going out, we're getting ready to be on a plane again to go across the country to potentially look at houses to move into, like in a different state. So it's like. There's a lot that's going to be happening in like this weird breadth of space that's happening. Like, I've got speaking things that I've got a plan for. I've got content that I have to create and I have content that I've created that I have to do something with, which, you know, warning when you create something, you're not done. Then there's like the editing of the thing, and then there's the publishing of the thing, and then there's the promotion of the thing. And then to also. I guess. Talk about something in, I don't know, I don't want to. I don't think I should say like candidly, because I've already like beat around it a little bit. There's this whole situation with social media, and we kind of talked about this during our co-working session the last and last or earlier this week. But like, I am extremely exhausted socially. A lot of that is I just hung out with about 2300 people at a conference. So like people doubt is is very real. But also just the divide of managing like LinkedIn and Twitter. And now I'm on blue sky and I never joined Mastodon, but people are telling me that I'm missing things because Mastodon so amazing, but then other people are like, it's not amazing. And like, yeah, there's like all this stuff. All that to say, I'm like really thinking about my energy and like. My battery, I feel like I haven't had a full charged battery in like so long. Oh, my gosh, I feel you deeply there. Yeah, yeah, but it but it feels like I'm at like 10 percent for months at a time. And and there's a lot of there's a lot of factors in that. So. What I've done, new systems, check name, as always, I go with an artist that I am excited about that I'm listening to. And I'm calling this one product and I've seen this for the first time because I'm literally typing it into the thing. I'm calling it a journey. I'm calling this project Thundercat. Nice. Now, for those who have heard Thundercat, Thundercat is a bassist. He's played with many amazing people. He's a wonderful bassist. Also, Thundercat is playing live, like in my area, and I'm like desperately trying to see if I can go to a concert. But I love about that base, about that base. No trouble. Different, different base. OK, fine. But the thing I like about Thundercat is his ability to play the bass. His ability to. Play in a way that is uniquely him. Play in a way that celebrates the things that he is interested in. While also being able to. Fit into an existing scheme so fluidly, like being able to play with so many amazing artists and musicians and play on their tracks and, you know, win awards for participating in the arrangement of a project that his name isn't on. But then also have this space for himself that is so uniquely him. And that's that's where. What I'm hoping to do with my system for the next quarter or so. Is to find a way to meld. A space for my work stuff, for my worky work stuff, a space for my personal projects that I still consider work. Like, there's a lot that goes into doing those. A space for the content that I create and then a separate space that is just uniquely me. Now, I my my wife and I don't necessarily have this level of like, who's the like, quote unquote, house manager or anything like that? We I like to believe that we try to share that responsibility equally. However, what we've kind of done is like, delegated each other to certain to certain areas of it. Like, like my kid's going to be starting school this year and she is handling like all of those things. However, we're talking about a cross country move and I am responsible for all of that. So there isn't necessarily a like, you know, we need this this home operating system that's like, all right, what's the status of this? It's like, no. My wife and I go, hey, everything's still good. OK, cool. If not, let me know. We'll figure it out. But until then, we're going to just trust that we've we've got our responsibilities intact. But the the other space, the other spaces are very, very uniquely mine. So I'm going to I'm going to rattle off some applications, unless, Kathy, did you have any? No, no. OK. So I can't I can't rattle off everything because I don't know everything, honestly. I will also double down that analog journaling, just kind of a jot down of all the things you did that day has really helped. And that as I go back and I look at it, I can see the days of chaos because they don't exist in here. Days that are are very, very disordered and disorganized usually don't make it into the notebook, just because I'm often thinking about so many things. Right. The the days that are in there are usually days where I can go like, here's what I was thinking about, here's what I was acting on, here were the events that I had. And I can quickly kind of just scrub through those really quick and be like, oh, yeah, I had that big project. Where was that? So, yes, my my analog journal, my plotter journal is absolutely still kind of the the documentarian of of my life currently. For the work work stuff, I have Microsoft Loop. Microsoft Loop is public now. I haven't had too much access to it for a long time, but I have had it maybe a little bit longer than a few others. It was in like private beta. Now I think it's in public beta. Microsoft Loop is similar to Notion, similar to those things, but it's built into the Microsoft ecosystem. Obviously, I work for Microsoft, so that's like a whole thing. But the thing I like about it is that I can create a loop and then that loop can then move into something like Teams for like our conversations there. It can move into email so that I can and then even like Word documents. So the nice thing about it is I can write it once and then use it in multiple places. And as I'm using it, like if I make changes, I don't have to go back and like rethink everything. I just have to go and update the loop and then the loop updates everything else, which is really, really nice, really, really convenient. And it helped me a lot in this planning for this event that I was a part of. In terms of my personal, like developer projects, I'm using GitHub. Obviously, developers know GitHub. GitHub has like 300 million users or something like that now. It's ridiculous. Or sorry, has 100 million users and 300 million projects. But GitHub has really stepped up the level of like organization and project management there. More than anything, the tool itself doesn't really matter. It's the like organization around the development. I got asked by someone that I've looked up to for several years about a project that I'm working on that they're interested in like using for their own stuff. And in order for that to happen, I need to make sure that I'm openly communicating ideas and thoughts and changes and development and things like that. But I need a way to do that. And instead of having this private place that I then have to go back and update, you know, a bunch of other stuff after the fact, I'm just doing it all in GitHub. Like I'm doing roadmaps and GitHub projects. I'm using GitHub discussions to convey ideas and thoughts and things like that. And then obviously issue tracking and just GitHub issues and stuff. And I understand if you're not a developer, a lot of this sounds very, very foreign. But like it definitely I think those that will benefit from that absolutely will be like, huh, I haven't taken a look at that. Maybe I can do so. And then I have that I have like my personal talks, which is kind of this weird hybrid thing, because it's like there are talks that I'm giving and that is kind of my job. But also these talks are very unrelated to the work that I do. So it it doesn't need to live with the work stuff. In fact, it's better if it doesn't live with the work stuff. And I'm using a very interesting tool for this, and it's a new browser. I'm using Arc browser. I've been using Arc browser for some time. If someone in the relay FM switch on Discord would like to try Arc browser and they haven't had access to it, let me know and I can get you an invite. I only have a few. So first come, first serve on that. But the thing I like about Arc browser is that it creates these permanent spaces where I can collect tabs and resources inside of a space. It also has these things called easels, which remind me a lot of like like a mural board, but maybe a little bit more structured, so more like a craft document. But the nice thing about it is I can keep all the links and the notes and the easels and stuff consolidated into one space. I have a conduit space that has a link to our drive, and I then also have a link usually to the latest folder. And those never go away. So whenever I'm like, oh, I need my conduit stuff, I just slide over to the conduit space and there it is. I also have tabs and stuff for work and then like my personal just I'm like living in this tab, tab or space that I'm in. It also has some other really cool features like you can do like side by side tabs, which is really convenient when you have like a tab in one space and then like a notes document. And then you also have like some other thing that you're doing research on and you can have all of those side by side by side, but in the same window like that is super convenient because then you can just drag and drop links and things like that over from one window into like your notes or whatever. So, yeah, as I'm as I'm working on that, like these talks, I'm grabbing all the information and resources and I'm putting them inside of a folder inside of a space. And then I'm using the easel to kind of outline or like mind map my like presentation of what I want to do. And that means I have like all the resources there already and already collected, which has been like super cool. So, yeah, that's that's kind of where I'm at. But I'm also thinking about like, like you said earlier, Kathy, like all of this stuff has to be these are all like doing. This isn't the like management of. Right. And that's where I'm really struggling is that I don't have. And I don't have an like I have an inbox because the inbox, I guess, would be drafts. That's where ideas start and then they make it to wherever they got to go. But I don't have a place where like projects with deadlines, projects with actionable steps. I don't have a place for that. And I am in desperate need of that. And there's a there's a product that I haven't tried because it's private still that I'm trying to get access to called Superlist. So I'm going to I'm going to shout it out to the universe. If you're listening to this and you have access to Superlist and you have the ability to invite somebody, I would greatly appreciate it. And the reason why I'm looking specifically at this is that it is it's made by the people who made Wunderlist, which is a great, great tool. It has a lot of features similar to Todoist, but it also seems as if it has better support for rich media, where when I am working on things like images and things like that, I feel like that's going to probably have a better effect. But also, I'm not doing enough, in my opinion, that something like a sauna really makes sense. I feel like a sauna has like way more than what I need. And I mean, so I will say this when it comes to like something like a sauna, if you're getting overwhelmed or whatever, you don't necessarily need to worry about. Like, just don't use what you don't need, if that makes sense. Like, I understand that you want to use something to the best of its ability, like, or come in and make choices best, like based on what you're doing. But you can use something like a sauna at the very, very basic level, to the point where you're not stressing about like, oh, I, you don't need a force using the system, how you think it should be so much as letting it be what you want it to be. So I hear you. And here's the problem. So the basic level of a sauna, the free version of a sauna, doesn't do quite enough. But the next step does too much. And what I really feel like I need is I need creativity by restriction. Okay. Like, I need the ability to say like, I need to build this thing within the constraints of what I have. Because if I have more and I reach out for like that new feature, it might be like, oh, I can just do everything. This is why a tool like Notion doesn't really work for me. And then it's like, the limitation is like, oh, we'll just start building databases of everything. And then like a month later, I have like 47,000 databases and I still don't know what I'm doing. This is the same problem that we had with, I think in the last systems check, I mentioned trying out Tana. And like Tana is a fun application. It did the things that helped me do some of the things that I was trying to do at that time. But what I learned was that like, oh, you can just add this and then you can add this and this depends on these other things. And then what I realized was I was spending more time organizing my thoughts than acting on them. So I need like a slightly lighter version of the premium tier of a sauna. And there are the personal whatever, whatever the first pay tier is. And that's where I think Superlist is going to work because it is very much like Todoist does this. The problem with Todoist is there are often things that I need to like, I want to be able to like drag and drop a file and the file just be sitting there. And I need to drag and drop an image and I can see the image. I don't need to like click on it and it goes to a link somewhere and then I got to go and view the link and the other stuff. Yeah. So that that's where I'm like in this really weird space because Superlist is kind of the first app that I've seen that kind of does this really well just based on like the the couple of like promo videos that I've seen. And that's where I'm like really interested in trying it. I mean, I could try and it just doesn't work, honestly. But I'm very interested in the the idea of like, I really just need to do it. But with like a slightly better support for rich media and hopefully I'm hoping that Superlist is that it may not be. But, you know, we'll see. Yeah, I think it's important to be aware of how things work for your brain. And this is kind of why we do these systems checks. This is why, you know, we're never going to say, oh, you have to use this app or don't use this app or never do this, that or the other thing, because it's important to know that everyone is different. And that is also why there are eight million different task management soft systems out there because, well, there's a lot of brains and not everything will work for everything else.

Source 100 percent renewable electricity for their production sites and offices and feature sustainably sourced seafood in their meals. We were lucky enough, Jay and I both, to get meals from factor. And let me tell you, I have tried every meal delivery service there is. And the biggest issue I have with the make your own ones that they have all of the ingredients is that it never takes half an hour. I'm a slow person in the kitchen. And so any time I have to do this chopping or whatever, it's always exhausting and I hate it. And by the time it's time to eat, I'm over it. The same with all of the other ready made ones that I've tried that they come frozen and nothing tastes as good as you want it to, especially the vegetables. They always are like shriveled and gross and don't even look attractive, let alone taste good. However, let me tell you, these factor meals were so flipping good. Broccoli and green beans and rice and filet mignon with mushrooms. And just I had these six ones. I had a wild mushroom filet mignon. And it was amazing. The blackened salmon was incredible. I have become obsessed with salmon. And the fact that this was just like so flavorful and it was with agouta, cauliflower grits and the broccoli, like all of it together was absolutely incredible. I also had the creamy parmesan chicken with broccoli and tomatoes. And the tomatoes, even though they were, you know, it was microwaved and you're like, oh, these tomatoes are not going to be good. Oh, no, they were perfectly flavored. This potato, the broccoli with this like mashed potato sauce thing. I don't even know what it was, but it was freaking amazing. I also got the Mediterranean grilled chicken with a huge like slab of like tasty sauces, delicious like butter, the broccoli once again, perfection and a chickpea mash that I didn't even think I would like. But I tried it and it was incredible. I also got the black pepper sage pork chop with cheddar Brussels sprouts and creamy broccoli. So flipping good. So much flavor in each of these. And then the last one that I got was mushroom chicken thighs with wild rice and garlic roasted green beans. And this one was my absolute favorite. Like if I could have just a stack of these in my refrigerator for meals at any time, it was incredible. The best part about this is I didn't have to think about what to make for lunch. I just went and I grabbed one. I knew it was going to taste good. I knew it was going to do exactly what I needed to because I was able to pick gluten free options. None of them had like a note that said it was gluten free. But there was enough like if it's not pasta, if this is not bread, you know, those types of things, I could pick options that did not have gluten based products in it. All of them were delicious. I am so excited that we were able to try them out because I'd been looking at it for a while. And let me tell you, it was perfect. Additionally, we got some smoothies and prepackaged smoothies. I usually they're either too thick or like grainy because of whatever they do in it. These ones were flawless, like nice and juicy and just flavorful and absolutely delicious.

Our thanks to Factor for their support of this show and all of Relay FM. So yeah, as Kathy mentioned, we definitely want to hear your systems. Also, give your system a name. I think that, you know, a lot of folks love when they see like, oh, yeah, I follow GTD or I follow this or I practice this thing. I think it's interesting that. We're so quickly to adopt a thing and then customize it to make it ours, but we don't change the name of it to really signify that it's ours. And I think that's where a lot of folks start getting into the minutia about, well, it's not really agile because blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, even though like, you know that. So it's just easier to say like, oh, I have my little system that I call this one. It might make you giggle like it does for me. Like, too, it might also reflect kind of why you chose that thing. I know some people do that year of or the themes for their years. This is very much the same mindset in that in that it's not while you're not saying I'm doing everything with this in mind, you're saying I am. Creating a space or a system that works for me in the time that I'm at. And what better way to earmark this time by giving it a name or a project name and things like that, which is why I called mine Project Thundercat this time. Instead of just like the Thundercat method or the Thundercat system, because it's not really it. It's my hope is that eventually things calm down and then I can just go back to my regular system and be happy with it. But in the moment, I recognize that all of these things, all these pieces, I do need kind of something special to try out until things work and then until things are resolved. And then once the things are resolved, then maybe I can reassess. Right. As always, we will definitely be constantly reassessing because that's how we roll. Yeah, so this is this one was a weird episode. Again, the next episode is going to be back to normal. So we hope that you did your your connection for the month.
