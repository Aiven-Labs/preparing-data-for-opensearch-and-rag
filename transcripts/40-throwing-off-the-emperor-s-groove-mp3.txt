From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that is rockin' just like the new year. This episode is brought to you by Issue. I'm Jay and with me is the first unicorn I've gotten to talk to all 2023. The one, Kathy Campbell. Hi, Kathy. Wait, Jay, you have other unicorns you talk to? I'm really like, I feel like this is going to we need to have a deep dive into this. We've discussed this already. My daughter is also a unicorn. That's true. Oh, actually, I haven't talked to her before. I was like, you haven't. For the record, it is January 10th and you have not spoken to your daughter for 10 days. I am, wow, really disappointed in you. What kind of father are you? The last time someone continued to make jokes about how they raised their children, they got canceled. So I'm just going to continue on and go to shout out. Yeah. So shout outs to all the folks at Relay FM, switch on the suits, the pod daddies themselves and our wonderful, wonderful design and admin team for helping with something special that is coming soon. No spoilers. I'm not going to tell you yet. You'll have to tune in to next episode to find out. We've got we've we finally got some some super awesome stuff in store other than our regular shows, which are always super awesome. And yeah, we will learn more about that in two weeks. Kathy, what about you? Yeah, I have a shout out for my friend Ashley, who literally dropped everything that she was working on through. Well, didn't actually throw, but buckled in her two kids under five into her truck to come out and meet me at Costco to load and bring home three big boxes that had our new couch in it. That's a surprise. We went to Costco and bought it a couch. We were not expecting to buy a couch, but we did. And mad props to Ashley for for being so willing to like just be like, yeah, I got you. And she's like, I'll be there in 20 minutes. I was like, oh, I was not expecting that. Amazing. And so now we have a new couch. That's awesome. I love new couches. Has anyone fallen asleep on the new couch yet? Other than the pets? No, but Ophelia has been very insistent that we must start our day out snuggling on the couch. So I started doing my morning journaling on the couch, which is very nice. That's adorable. That's super awesome and adorable. Also, shout out to the feedback thing, because that's what I put in the in the chat or in our notes. Yeah, folks, you might have noticed a lot of shows talking about how they're not on Twitter anymore. And while Jay is sometimes against his own will, still on Twitter for reasons work. But he you know, we're both kind of not on it as much as we used to and for different reasons, which means now we are in the process of figuring out how do we keep in touch with people? How do they get in touch with us? And if you're a super awesome, wonderful member of Relay FM Switch On already, then you know that the Discord is the best cord to keep everybody on the same accord. But unfortunately, there are a few people who, for whatever reasons, we don't judge here, but they're not members. And we have to be able to. We want to be able to. Oh, yeah. Kathy wants to be kidding. We want to be able to make sure that we can hear from them as well. And we now have a cool little feedback button. You can go to relay.fm slash conduit and you can submit feedback that way. There'll be a little button that says submit feedback or you can just check the show notes. And there should be a link there for submitting feedback. Apparently also you can go to relay.fm slash conduit slash feedback and it does the same thing, which I did not know about. But thank you, Chat, for telling me that. So, yeah. And again, that takes a lot of work. I am a developer, so I do kind of have some idea of what kind of goes into planning and getting a thing like that built. I know that Mike and Stephen have been working and our developer, Ben, has also been working to really make that happen. And it turned around really quickly. Like it was like, hey, we should do this. And then all of a sudden, like the next week, it's done. So amazing, amazing work to the team that did that. Definitely. And we love all of the relay.fm Switch On members, but especially the ones that are in our Discord. It's such a great community that lets you meet other like minded fans of the network. We also record this show live every fortnight. And you can come hang out in the chat with us while we do the show and interact, as well as be exposed to some of our behind the scenes shenanigans. Yeah, you can learn why Jay had the worst absolute weekend ever. Yes, yes. If you want to join us, you can become a member at GiveUsYourFlippingMoney.com and support Jay and I directly. Another way to support us is by visiting YukonWearIt.com and checking out our merch options. We have stickers and a variety of clothing. I am so excited. I finally placed my order and I have hoodies coming. And it's very exciting. And I kind of have two things to say towards the merch stuff. It has been brought to my attention that, unfortunately, some of the women's apparel does not have the same amount of options in terms of colors and things to select. Unfortunately, that's not something that we have any control over. The company that we work with, the entire network works with, we basically have to, we're kind of beholden to what they offer in some cases. But what I will tell you is when we do limited run items and special things, we can usually get more options available to us. So if you want us to do more things like that, then you got to support the things that we have available already, because that tells us that it's worth doing. Because a lot of that stuff you have to pay for in advance. And also a big shout out to two of my wonderful friends, both Laura and Jen. They know who they are for just kind of promoting one conduit, but also the amazing conduit merch on on stream. So it was it was super awesome to have them just like just fan over the work that that we've been working on and our designer has been working on. And it is it is absolutely so rewarding to see people really enjoy what we've been able to come up with. Exactly. So with that out of the way, Kathy, I think it's time to do a connection check. That was also a good one. That was good. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah. So my connection was to finalize my budget and I have a green checkmark because I did it. I act instead of trying to retroactively spend way too much time developing an Excel or Google like sheet spreadsheet. I bought one off of Etsy and I'm very excited and it looks great and it works great. And it's already helped me be more mindful of my purchases. Granted, yes, I did buy a couch, but still I was mindful about it. That's awesome. I remember messaging you saying connection check and you're like, how how is that? Like, was this all kind of like super, super, super last minute, like rushing to do it or? I mean, yes, that's OK. And that no, it's great. I had started it, but I hadn't finished. And so by by sending me that reminder, I was like, OK, I'm going to sit down and actually do what I know I need to do. But I haven't done it yet. So, yeah, accountability coming in hot. It's almost like we need people to provide accountability more than every other week. Totally not foreshadowing. What a good idea. Interesting. Anyway, on to my connection, I was supposed to make a new video and yeah, I made I made a short and I made a video. And I was very happy with this. And kind of like the reason that it was kind of different than the last couple of times where I've used this connection. And I promise that won't be the connection this week is that the last few times I knew what I needed to do. Like, I already had the topic. I already had, you know, what I was wanting to make a video on. And this time it was like I got nothing. So I wanted to be able to go from nothing to video in two weeks. And I mean, to be honest, I should be able to do more than, you know, one video and one short in two weeks. But also, I'm working on it. So give me a break already. Come on. But yeah, it was it was good to it was good to be able to do this and be like, all right, I can do this. And I have had some some kind of stalling on another topic, but we'll we'll get to it. We'll get it figured out. We'll keep trying. Yes, we will. And don't worry, the link will be linked for the video will be in the show notes. Right. I mean, if you're nerdy and you want to watch it, sure, why not? Let's jump to our conductors connections, starting with Dan. Dan is our civil engineer of the show and he has an orange circle. I started the year strong with a decent workout, journaling and reading routine and got in touch with old friends. I've struggled to get my sleep quite to where I want it, but it was my birthday this week. And who wants to be going to bed early when there are movies to watch and popcorn to eat? Sounds to me like you got a green circle because that was pretty successful. And the choices that you made to not get sleep were purposeful. But obviously, if you want to sit with the orange circle, that's also acceptable. But to me, you're green. And oh, I just got a text. This is why friends I don't have do not disturb on because Jay had to go yell at his dogs. And I noticed it because I got a text. So hi, friends. Thank you, Javier. First off. OK, good. I was vamping and not doing it very well. But that's OK, because, yeah, there are friends are here and it's easy to hang out with. And yes, I'm finished with that connection. So that means high. So far, Oracle of the show says Green Apple as planned. I got a planner. Well, I'm glad everything went according to plan. It's a lovely Travelers notebook, which is so nice that I've been using it every day now. And I just keep on using it. I loved using my Travelers notebook. That was probably one of my favorite notebooks. I still have the the rap for my notebook. And honestly, the only reason I stopped using them was that I stopped working at the place that had an industrial sized paper cutter that allowed me to cut the notebooks that I wanted to use, like to the perfect size. But, yeah, congratulations on and welcome to the Travelers family. All right. Our new conductor, Adam, who is the reader of the show, has a green book. I've got a yearly theme. This is the year of stability. And I scheduled our couples goal setting retreat with my wife. I am so excited for you both and really excited to see how the future comes, how it goes. Yes. Yes. Yay. Retreats. Skylar, our pink blue dragon of the show, says connection check the season of light. Oh, flight. I can't read the season of flight and light has started strong. And also so has the new semester. That's awesome. I enjoyed catching up with Skylar on their show. I'm not going to say it wrong. I'm not going to say it wrong. I always say it wrong. Finding my dragon. Find my dragon. Oh, see, darn it. That was what I was going to say on find my dragon. And yeah, if you want to hear how that season has started so far, you should totally check out their show as well. Next up, James, our panda of the show, has a black box. Maybe I took too much of a break, had a significant worsening of my eye problems after Christmas, which has left me in a pretty black mood. Truth be told, I share in case others are having a rough time of things, too. There's I obviously, James, I adore you and I want nothing but the best. And it's OK to have black moods. It's OK to be frustrated. It's OK to be angry at the world. That was my day on Sunday night. And I ended up, you know, crying in my car, basically. And it's OK to have those moments. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging the terrible time that's going on. We are here to support you, regardless of what your connection check answer is, and regardless of how you feel, because you are valid and loved, even if you are in a black mood. Our soprano of the show, Deborah, I don't know why I started talking like this all of a sudden. Yeah, that was our we. Our our soprano of the show, Deborah says green chow. I'm not going to I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't need that. I'll get away. We're going to cut that. Cut that. Thanks, Javier. Let's try third time's a charm. Deborah, our soprano of the show, says green check made a ton of progress on the baby quilt for my friends. Progress in the photo. Yes. In the hashtag creativity. It's gorgeous. And if you want to see it, well, give us your flipping money.com. That's all I'm going to say. But wait, Deborah. Chris, our shark of the show says I have reached acceptance with the reality of turning 50. Really, it's not as bad as it seemed like it would be. 50 is great. 50. I mean, I'm not there quite yet, but I'm excited to be there because it means I'm still alive. Give me nine years and two months. Two and a half months, something like that. I've got some time, but I'm I'm I'm looking forward to all of my friends reaching it and telling me that it's it's pretty good. Our train enthusiast of the show, Relsie, says connection check green circle. The sleep score has been mostly maximized in the last seven days. Only two were below 90. Thank you. Sleep plus plus. Excellent. And our final connection check of this episode it comes from the nameless of the show, Robert Connection Check. Yellow Heart, my wife and I have unpacked most of the essentials for the house. Our fave was a framed silhouette. We got done at Disney after our engagement. We were able to enjoy the new year with family and ate lots of good food. But I forgot to move my desk and work from home things from my parents' house. And I start working from home tomorrow. OK, you still have time. You still have plenty of time. And you will you can do it. Yes, you can. Yeah, we'll jump into our topic.

It looks super professional. It's a like a physical magazine that you see online. It's so easy to use with the pro version.

So speaking of disappointing, Kathy, you, you messaged me about a potential topic. You said you were annoyed. You said you were frustrated and all because Jay's horrible take on, I'm kidding, no, not, it wasn't, it wasn't the Disney thing. We're not, we're not bringing back the, the, that's the, we've gotten more feedback about that. And terrible, but also hilarious. But no, you, you mentioned that, that there are, there are times when you want to do some stuff or there are times when you're doing things and, uh, you get a little annoyed or frustrated with it. So I'm going to, I'm going to let you take it from here. Yeah. So as some of you know, I am a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a Yeah. So as some of you know, I am a caregiver for my husband who had a stroke in 2010. And there's something really frustrating, especially if I'm already on edge and just angry at the world, um, when I will get a message from him to come and do his coffee. Now I really like at the base of it, I don't mind. It's hard for him to fill it up. He only has one hand that he can use one arm. It's hard for him to walk it from the counter to his desk. It's so much easier for me. Plus it allows me to get out of my chair and take a break and stretch and, and walk around and, and do these things. And yet when I am having one of those days, it's so frustrating to get interrupted and have to go do it. In fact, he just woke up and messaged me while I was reading the ad for coffee. And so I had to remind him I'm in a podcast, so I can't go and do that. And it just made me think about how there are so many times, not just in this, um, where the most mundane of tasks can just feel so overwhelmingly frustrating that you just want to scream something like grocery shopping or laundry or, oh my gosh, you have to make dinner again every day you need to eat. And it's, it's just, I don't, I don't have a solution for this. I just wanted to kind of vent a little bit, but also talk about things because I'm just really frustrated, uh, at my frustration, which I know is not helpful. And I know that it's not, you know, yes, it happens. And it's okay to be frustrated. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to experience all of these emotions, but by golly, is it also really like a level of guilt almost because yeah, if you have a little kid, they can't make food themselves and it's okay to be frustrated at having to make a meal for your three year olds. Hmm. So I want to empathize, but first I want to cherish this moment, uh, where I get to reference one of the best, uh, only, only good things to ever come out of Disney, uh, which is one of my favorite movies of all time, because it's not adapted from a, uh, someone else's cultural story, except for it kind of is. And then they went buck wild with it, which was also just kind of funny, which is the emperor's new groove. Um, let me just say throwing off the emperor's groove is hands down one of the most relatable feelings on the planet. When, when you are in your, you're in the swing, you are just doing it and something comes in, you were just like, ah, you threw off and literally the response of like the groove, the groove, don't throw off the groove, like jettisoning, jettisoning, like someone out of a window and letting them hang by a banner, um, and being safe, of course. Uh, but just, you know, when that happens, I have, I have related to that so many times, just wanting to work on a video. And then, you know, I share an office with, with my wife and she now live streams three times a week. Uh, so there is absolutely these moments where like, I'm in the swing of it. I'm in my groove. I'm getting ready to do another video. And then all of a sudden the door opens and it's like, Oh, got to set up for my stream. And I'm like, no, like it is just like those moments. And one of the things that I've been doing recently, um, is obviously going through therapy, which is great. And I recommend it for anybody. And of course I understand that there are a lot of issues with that, but if you have the means and you have the ability to, I want to just say therapy is an amazing thing. Uh, and we've been going through like CBT, uh, cognitive behavioral therapy, and I am not a therapist. I'm not licensed, so I'm not going to subscribe anybody to this, but the thing that I've picked up from a lot of our conversations, my therapist and I is a lot of our self awareness, a self awareness. Wow. Words are basically the triangle of our thoughts, our behaviors and our emotions. And the, the feeling of that is like, again, when we're, when, when our behavior, we're doing things, we're feeling good, we're thinking we're awesome. And then all of a sudden something just comes in and like derails all of that. Yes. It takes us out of that moment of self awareness and forces us to then reposition how we're thinking because we're no longer thinking about ourselves or what we're doing or being in that, that quote unquote, like flow state or whatever. Instead, we're trying to do whatever the thing is so that we can get back to it. Um, that being said, I don't have any solutions for you, Kathy, unfortunately. Um, but is there a magic app that can fix this? Yeah, it's, it's called, it's called Omnidua things. Um, you can, you can find it on the app store. I think it is $500 a month. Um, and yeah, it's, it's totally amazing. It's life changing. It's revolutionary. Uh, but I, I did want to at least try to think of some ideas of how we can reframe, how we can reassess, realign, like, how do we make these moments better? Yeah. Like, I'm just wondering. I, it's, I wish I knew. What's like the baby-est version of doing, making it better? So what I've been kind of doing currently and it works sort of, but obviously it doesn't fix the long-term solution, but it does help with the active brain thing is doing what needs to be done and then taking a break. And sometimes this involves crying in the car and sometimes taking a shower or a bath. Um, sometimes sitting on a couch, snuggling with the dog. Um, and it tends to like, let the energy release, like let the negative thoughts that are rolling around in my head kind of solidify in a way that I can then move on. Almost. I don't know if that makes any sense, but I, the way my brain works too, is I have a hard time, like I don't have an internal monologue necessarily. And I don't like have, I don't, I don't remember the actual word for it, but if I, I have these, the feelings in my brain and the emotions and the thoughts and the general, like whatever, um, it's, it's something that I wish it was as easy as sitting in the corner with, you know, one of those, uh, focus. I forget what it's called. When you were a kid, they had the things that are, um, like a jar with like glitter in oil, um, my daughter has one of those. Yeah. Shake the little shaky jar. Yeah. And you, you can only come out of time out when everything's settled and there's no glitter in the jar anymore. Um, and I'm thinking maybe I need to get one of those. Put yourself in time out. Put myself in time out. Because I think it would be like, yeah, it's like a snow globe, but it's different. Like, um, like it's usually bigger. Yeah. It's, it's an interesting little craft, especially for those that have young ones. I think my daughter made hers with our nanny. Um, I know privilege, um, when she was, I think like two, and it's just one of those things that are like super like mesmerizing to watch and it definitely does help you calm down. It helped her calm down a lot. Um, so yeah, I, I, I've been thinking about this a little bit, uh, especially since, you know, again, Kathy and I have lots of conversations during the week and you know, just even when the topic came up, I was just like, you know, what, what are some of the smallest of things? And, uh, I'm going to get woo-woo productivity person on you for a second. That's okay because we're acknowledging the fact that this is not our normal. It's fine. Yeah. And then that we do acknowledge that it is woo-woo and it is productivity. Yes. Yes. So there is this idea of like your environment having a lot of impact on the, on the things that like, on how you feel, your emotions, all that good stuff. And, uh, one of my favorite versions of this conversation comes from, uh, an author named Campbell Walker. Uh, he, it goes by the name Stoothless on YouTube, uh, former drug addict, uh, former tattoo artists. Well, still tattoo artists. I think, I don't think, I think that's like a once always kind of thing. Uh, and now runs a digital media company and has written a book called, uh, your head is a houseboat. And I really enjoy his perspective because it's, it's one of those things where like, anyone that talks about like, I needed to change my environment because my environment caused me to do drugs. Like, okay. I, I, I give them a little bit more, um, value than the person that's like, I run a multimillion dollar corporation and my environment is how I do it. Like, oh, okay. Uh, I feel like, I feel like Stoothless's stuff is a little bit more authentic, uh, in terms of like actually being life changing. Um, but in that space, he, he, he, you know, he covers some of the basics, which is like, Hey, if you want to work out in the morning, make sure you have your bag packed with your clothes right next to it and put your phone inside your bag. That way, when the alarm goes off, you have to like get up and go over to the bag and do the thing and you'll be all ready, ready to go. Um, but I wondered if there was a way that you could prepare for the disruption to, to avoid the groove from being thrown off. And, and this is, this is like one of those things where like, it is so hard to do something for just the amount of time. You know, if I say I'm going to write in my journal for five minutes, I wind up writing for like 15th, but I do wonder if there is a way that we can figure out how to set up our environment so that when the interruption comes in, we're ready for it. I have no ideas, honestly, mainly because like timing is so different and variable. And I mean, even just for example, today, he didn't wake up until after we had already started recording the show, whereas yesterday he was awake before I woke up at 5 45. Like there's no pattern necessarily. And because of the situation we're in too, it's difficult to, to, it's difficult to see if we could try and have any sort of patterns specifically for this issue. And obviously I have a variety of other things that throw off the emperor's groove and it's all fine, except it's not, but like, you know, it's, it's things that you, that you work through and you try and, and do your best at, but there's no, like, I don't know what a solution even looks like at this point. Like you, you sent me the Ember glass and that's would be a great idea if that was an issue. But the only thing I could think of is like putting the coffee pot on his desk, which then becomes a whole other issue if he knocks it over or the cat knocks it over and we end up having a huge issue with coffee everywhere. And like, it's, it's just, it's just frustrated. I think it's just, it's like, it's just frustrating to, to not have a solution or even know what that solution could look like other than having a, you know, a magical unicorn that lives in my house that can deliver coffee. You mean you don't have one of those? I know. I'm sorry. It's getting fixed. So that's, that's kind of the, the other question in mind there is, well, I guess two things. One, you know, we're, you're saying, you know, it's the variability that makes it harder. I, I love coffee, so we could, we could nerd out about coffee. If only there was a time where the two hosts of conduit could connect with people and nerd out about things that don't really fit the conduit thing. Oh man. What a good idea. We should see if we can figure that out somehow. Absolutely. But is, is there a way to optimize the process of, of making coffee? Maybe it's, and again, this, this hurts my heart to say maybe grind the beans before the coffee is, you know, before, like when you wake up in the morning that way, that's one less step you have to do when your, when your groove is thrown off so that you can get back to grooving. I mean, I, I prep it already at night. So all he has to do is push the button, which he'll do when he comes, when he moves from the bed to his desk, he'll push the button so that it loads. It's like the transporting from the kitchen to his desk. That is the big, what a robot that carries the coffee for you. I know the podcast that talks about these robots. I think it's called Roboism. It's also on relay FM. Oh, oh man. New, new goals, new goals. Get Kathy a coffee serving robot that will just move the coffee from one location to the other. Right. And pour it in the, in the cup and. Absolutely. It has to do all the things. Someone get like, not Sarah Dychey, I forgot her name now. Nevermind. Someone find a maker on YouTube to do that for us. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, I, I'm sure there might be there. I, there might be a solution. We're open to so many different things. And it's not that he can't do things because when I'm gone, he's, he's able to do it, but it's so exhausting and it's so overwhelming that it ultimately is just easier for me to do it so that it doesn't completely ruin his day even more. Uh, because it's hard to do things with only one, uh, arm, one hand, like it just, you know, it's a, it's, it's the reality of the life that I live. And it's, I was going to say it's fine. And that's not, I don't want it to not in the sarcastic sense, like I am so thankful that he is as well as he is and the journey that we've done over the last, I don't know, 13 years now, 12, 12 and a half years, like has been, you know, a long one, but every so often, man, I just, it's okay. It's exhausting. It's just what I'll say is it's exhausting. So next idea. Yes. Um, there is actually, I'm going to save that one. I'm, that was going to be the wrap up idea because it's all again, it's good feelings and woo-woo-ness. Um, Excellent. That other idea, are there other methods that will help wind down the groove so that it can be picked back up in an easier manner? And this has been something that, you know, I talked to our good, uh, the official, when one of us is in Europe, uh, cohost, Either national, we got to leave it open in case. South America or like Australia. I thought we just got someone else when we were doing maybe it hasn't happened yet. So I'm going to get a phone call for that one. I already know how good Scotty is. Yeah. So I just had a conversation with Scotty yesterday about this idea of, uh, something in my setup that is linked to like rapid logging in some ways and just kind of planning out what I'm doing a little more extra than what I've done before. And this isn't a systems check. So I will talk about this more in February when that happens. But I've been, I've been trying to, uh, do the French term, me some plus, which is like have everything out and ready to go before I start working in hopes that the extra time will wind up saving me time in the future. And this isn't necessarily like, oh, have, you know, micro task or whatever. This is just have a document that talks about what you're doing and has the steps, the resources, all the things that you're going to need and a little checklist at the top that says like, here's what you're doing. So when, when, you know, you stop, it's like, right as I'm stopping, this is where I left off. This is where I need to pick back up so that I can wind down, go do that thing, come back and not feel like I have to start over from scratch. I just have to look at the thing and go, oh, you just did this. This is what you need to do and go from there. How's that? Would that help in any way? I could see how that could be helpful, but the problem for me is that I very, very rarely have anything that is repeated in such a way that I could do anything like that and prep it, if that makes sense. Like everything that I do is so not repetitive necessarily. But what I do do is like, I will, I said do do. Oh my God, Kathy, come on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We're very serious here. Very serious. Very serious. I will have whatever I'm actively working on, the only thing up on my screen. So I'll minimize, do the fancy little hide others tool so I don't get distracted when I come back to do whatever it is that I was currently working on, which is helpful. And it's also helpful, like I'm able to say, hey, I'm on a podcast or just a minute, let me finish up this project or whatever. So it doesn't necessarily have to be done right that second. But it still breaks concentration. Okay. Yeah. I mean, that's, I think the challenge there is like everything that I do is different kind of portion there, which I mean, I feel like the solution in that case is you don't necessarily have to plan everything out, but maybe you just have a, I mean, have you done rapid logging before? I mean, I know it's one of those nerdy productivity tips that people often suggest, but. Trying to remember. Go ahead and here we'll say that I know exactly what it is, but I would love for you to explain using your words what we're looking for. So a lot of folks just jump into like time tracking is like, oh, I need to know, I want to know exactly how much time I spent doing that. This isn't that this is a running log of the things that you are doing and when you're doing them. And this is actually something that I have tried to do. And I'll be honest, I'm not good at it. I forget more than anything, which is kind of why this whole like measure 8,000 times and then do the work is kind of the new idea. But ultimately it would just be as you're going to do a thing, have a big piece of paper and write down the thing that you're doing. And then when you go to do something different, write that down. And what that could do is at least give you the again, I'm trying to figure out. I don't think we can solve the you've thrown off the groove. It's how do we get from you threw off the groove to let's groove tonight? Like, how do we how do we move from the Emperor's new groove to is that that's our earth when in wow, I'm showing. Oh, no. Wow. Is there a twin? It is earth, wind and fire. I'm not wrong. I know I was just going to sit here and laugh at you. Okay. Um, but yeah, like anything that we can do in this case that tries to quickly reorient you back into the groove. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I'm I'm more than happy to try things and it might be a thing that I'm working. Like it might work. I don't know. Hmm. And then the the last thought that I had in this wild moment was going all the way back to that CBT thing. The the first step in in like CBT that I wrote down in my notes here was mindfulness, which I hate that buzzword so much, but sure. Okay, cool. Whatever. The second one is the cognitive reframing and restructuring. And I feel like in many ways, you've already started that process or you try to bring about that process. Yeah. In in that it's like it's not, oh man, Ryan threw off my groove. How do I get back into this thing? And now I got to figure out how I'm going to do this again. It's like, oh no, my partner threw off my groove and now I'm able to enjoy a moment doing something for them. And then I can go back and do the other things because in reality, the more important thing is my relationship with my partner. Yeah. Yeah. Either way, it's hard. And anyone going through something similar or like, yeah, frustration is is a normal part of life. And I know that it's it's something that you have to be able to like really, really vibe with where you're at. And it's important to know where emotions come from and all of that stuff. But I'm just tired. Yeah. And and it's understandable. Caretaking is is a hard task. It is mentally draining. I am I've never been in that position before. I've watched other caretakers around me and the level of exhaustion you just kind of see from it is is unreal. Well, and I would I would argue that you are a caregiver because you have a small child that requires assistance in surviving or you give care to another. We've already discussed this, Kathy. I haven't talked to her since January. I know that's true. It's true. That's true. You can you can survive, you know, 10 days without talking to your kids. So maybe you're not a caregiver. Although she did come into the room earlier and had to like pantomime like I'm recording, I'm recording. But and you know, even even if we're, you know, talking about this from the lens of kind of Kathy's situation, you know, I hope that some of the advice that's been given and even some of the stories that that we've, you know, have talked about, I hope that people can empathize with that. I hope people can relate in some ways. Again, I don't I'm not a caretaker of someone of my partner, but I do have those moments where like I'm in the groove and then all of a sudden someone that I care about comes in and, you know, puts a rock on the rails, which do not do. I'm only saying that as a kid that totally did this as a kid. Do not do this. But I really do hope that you at least feel seen and heard if you're in a similar situation. And I also feel that maybe some of the advice, some of the resources, some of the things that we've talked about, maybe that sparks an idea to just try something. And you know what the best part about trying stuff is? If it doesn't work, you can just stop doing it and you can try something different. So I would I would highly encourage you to, you know, if this is one that that you definitely related to, save it, download it, do all the things that you got to do and listen to it again and, you know, find those little moments there and clip them out and maybe even write them down. And then you just like, all right, I'm having a rough time. What are three things that I could do in this exact moment to either mitigate the throwing off of my groove or help me get back into the groove of things? Yeah, I like that idea of like a list of things that you can do that will help like calm your your brain a little bit or like or help refresh whatever to get back in the groove. I I totally am going to need one of those timeout jars. I wonder if they have one with the unicorn in it. Probably. You could probably make one, Kathy. I don't want to make one. I want someone else to make it for me because making one means I have to go get the supplies and then I have to sit down and actually put it together and then it probably leaks all over the place. And if it doesn't, it'll work the energy to make it. I would much rather just find one that someone else can make for me. It's interesting because as you said that, it was like I could do this thing that would be relaxing and kind of a way to get out of my head for a little bit. And in the end, I have this really cool thing that I made that helps me relax and calm down. And you just you just burn that idea to the ground. Yep. I apologize for saying your situ your idea was not helpful, but it was not helpful. OK, well, in that case, Kathy, what are you going to do in the next conduit? I am going to obtain a timeout jar. Audience, please help Kathy. Send the links. Go to our feedback page and say, Kathy, I know you could just make one. It literally cost three dollars. But here's one that I found. And if you make it, the more expensive you make it, just the more validated I'll feel. I'm kidding. Do that. Save Kathy's money instead. Give us your flipping money dot com. But yeah, we love Kathy and we want her to feel as relaxed as possible, no matter the cost. So, yeah, please, please people help Kathy out by showing her where she can find a relaxation glitter jar. Yes. What about you, Jay? What is your connection? I was about to say something and then we had a wonderful comment in the chat. This is I wonder if Hermes makes it. It's called Elmos, not Hermes. It's called Elmos. What? Yes, Elmos. I am going to take my own advice and do a thing that is create a wind down timer. So I've done live streaming before and it's interesting that we do like this, like this countdown to start your stream to kind of get you prepared. I'm going to try to basically reverse that and do like a hey, it's, you know, five to ten minutes before you're going to get interrupted to do your stream or, you know, for my wife to do her stream. Maybe you should start winding down. Maybe you should start, you know, turning the groove down so that it doesn't get thrown off. It gets gently placed off. So that that's going to be me. I'm going to I'm going to live with that for a couple of weeks. I don't know what it's going to look like. I don't want it to be just a random alarm because I feel like that's not helpful. But I do feel like there could be something to ease into that moment. And yeah, if you have any ideas on how to do that, let me know. You can go to relay.fm slash conduit and there's a feedback button there. Or you can just look in the show notes and there'll be a link to give us feedback on how to do that. Or if you're a member of Relay FM, switch on. You can let us know in the show follow up. But that's for us. What about our conductors? Yeah, we have some great connections this fortnight, including Dan, our civil engineer of the show. I found out last week that I had unjustly, in my opinion, failed my civil engineering chartership review, which knocked me out for a bit. This fortnight, I want to talk to my members. I want to talk to my mentors, get a plan together, reapply and keep my momentum up. Absolutely. You can do this. We believe in you and especially what you can get done and survive and succeed. Good luck. Next, we have our Oracle of the show, Soph, who says, Next connection. I have a really busy fortnight coming up, including a presentation. So I'm going to be writing that and trying to keep up with the hour a day on all of my other writing. I wish the best of luck. All right. Our reader of the show's next connection, Adam, says, Stay focused at work and go on the goal setting retreat. Abszla, frickin' Lutely. I'm so excited to hear all about that retreat. So excited. Skyler, the blue dragon of the show, says for the first time this week, I took the time on Sunday night to make a plan of attack for the week. There we go. I love that. It helped to ease my anxiety about what I needed to get done. My goal is to turn this into a regular habit to stay focused on what is ahead. It sounds like you're trying to get into the groove. Yeah, or prep the groove. Pre-plan the groove. I don't know. We're going to move on to our panda of the show, James. Next connection. Continuously remind myself that my self-worth is not tied to my productivity and also mentally prepare for turning 50 in just over two weeks. Not sure which is going to be harder. James, your self-worth is not tied to your productivity. You are amazing and incredible even if you do nothing. Yes, our soprano of the show, Deborah, says, next connection. Finish my radiation treatments. Yay. My last one is scheduled for the morning of the next conduit recording. Oh, that's so awesome. I am excited and hope that everything goes according to plan. Absolutely. Our shark of the show, Chris, says my connection for the next two weeks is to get my desk cleaned up so that it is easier to work. Oh my gosh. Talking about environment earlier in this episode. Yeah, having a clean desk. Super helpful. Aaron, are still unnamed of the show. Let us know what you want your name to be. My connection for this conduit of time is to touch base with friends. While I'm good at spending time online with my friends, I rarely see folks nearby in person. Feels like a good time to improve on that. Absolutely. Yes. Yeah. I think this should be a topic to discuss because I have some thoughts. I don't have in real life friends, so this would be really hard for me. Yeah, that's a good point. All right. So maybe we'll talk about it sometime in the future when it isn't an actual episode. Again, step one, find friends for Jay. Yes. Yes. All right. Our slot of the show, Onkano, connection for the next fortnight, work on overcoming my food prep paralysis and order out less. While eating out all the time is hypothetically fine, it's not something I can really do financially. And I've been doing it too much over the past few months. Connection is to prepare my meals, aid of the next 14 days, save money, and make myself just do the thing. Yes. You and me both. Absolutely. Our train enthusiast of the show, Railsie says, new connection, open my journal every day or at least as many days as possible until the new conduit. I require repetition to make things stick and I should make the stick. Do a fitness plus session at least twice a week. Oh, there's more. Start working on a few more blog posts, get those habits in. It's a lot, but I can do it. Absolutely. And I'm glad that we talked about some of these things on this episode because I'm going to tell you just leave your journal open and on the new page and put it wherever the first place you have the ability to write in it is and let it sit there and just go, hey, buddy, hey, buddy, want to write in the journal, please? I think that'll really help you in that. I can't help you with the other stuff. I don't do fitness stuff because I'm in horrible shape. I don't even know. All right, we're going to go move on to the final conductor's connection from the nameless of the show, Robert, who says new connection, move the desk. Second, find good habits to be productive at work while not overwhelming myself. Start my yearly journal. And finally, look for nice things to hang in the office. Yes, make that environment great.
