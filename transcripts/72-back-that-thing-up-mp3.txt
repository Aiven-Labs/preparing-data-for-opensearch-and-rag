From RelayFM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condu our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that is always prepared with a good backup. This episode is brought to you by Micro.blog and Ecamm. I'm Jay, and that dramatic pause was just that. It wasn't me trying to go back to our show notes. And with me is the person that always has their show notes ready and waiting, the one, the only, Kathy Campbell. Hey, Kathy, with a K. That's me, because that is the correct way to spell it. I'm just kidding. If you are a Kathy with a C, you are also acceptable. No, stop. Be nice. Oh, well, speaking of being nice, I was trying to be nice to... Segue into our, hey, we're working on doing transcription stuff, and we're going to keep practicing these until they work. And then it told me that the transcription failed. So... Oh, no. We're going to do this. We have a backup foreshadowing, but we're going to see what happens. Oh, Kathy. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. on this second day of April that we're recording on. Yeah, it is now April 2nd, but yesterday was April 1st, which if you are on the internet, you're here. So obviously you are. But it's April Fool's Day and we had a lot of fun in the discord, even more so than normal. We introduced everyone to two new shows, Brushed and Linen, I think it was, is what they're called, with the iconic 2003 and 2011 iOS designs. And more importantly, we also celebrated the Johnny Q. Now, if you are not a member of the discord and you have no idea what this is, congratulations. Your sanity is a little bit safer. However, if you would like to know, keep listening, because in the discord lore, there is something called the Johnny Q. One of our members, Justin, out of a bat, a bat, a bout of, I don't know how to say this. But he basically made a cube out of Johnny I faces, which has now become a thing like you do. And it's all over the place. And in honor of the joyful moment of April Fool's, we made a thing where if you reacted to a message enough with the Johnny Q, it got put on the Johnny board, very similar to our star board. Which is how you tell people that you enjoy. Oh, yes. Aiden said a surge of creativity. I love that. Yes. A surge of creativity. But that was fun. That was that was a fun little bit of chaos, a little bit of extra chaos to the discord. And if you missed out, I'm sorry, but there's still time. You can come join us. And then we all. So last week had our co-working where we and our superconductor friends were waiting patiently for Kathy to arrive. Little did we know that she was out on an adventure. Well, we kind of knew. We also didn't know if it was happening or not. It was a different type of adventure. Mini Soup drove us to the beach and I thought I was going to have internet before it happened. And spoiler alert, the internet hated me and I could not even get remotely connected. It was not letting me go in. So I missed out. I'm very sad because stuff happened. That's in the famous words of Paramore. That's what you get when you go to L.A. or something like that. We also talked about the fun and intriguing world that is advertising tech, which actually. Was really interesting. It brought back some ideas that were initially thought about in a previous episode of a show called Friends in Your Ears, which is really cool. And we also helped one of our superconductors work on the next million dollar presentation. It was great. We got to see what super fancy CEO. Presentations look like. And yeah, if you want to learn more about advertising, PowerPoint or actually fun stuff, you should join our next co-working session in the off weeks. I'm joking. It was actually really interesting and I had a lot of fun in the process. So you should have fun to join us for our next co-working session where you those words in the thing with the stuff. I'm malfunctioning. Let's try that again. Okay. Okay. If what happened in the discord and what happened in our co-working sounds fascinating to you and you're interested in that, then you should become a superconductor today. Visit. I'm a superconductor dot com. Not only do you get access to the discord, you also get access to our co-working sessions in the off weeks and you get access to the pre and post show where Kathy told us about how she had to battle the L.A. river. And how in the post show we're going to be doing a super fun March Madness in April mascot bracket. So if you were in the discord, you got the link. Fill out your brackets. The winner gets bragging rights. But you could have bragging rights, too, by becoming a superconductor. Visit. I'm a superconductor dot com today. Also, shout outs. Kathy, what's your shout out? Yeah. Big shout out to Laura, who inspired me to actually get stuff done by bullying me nicely to do the things that I needed to do. And we had a really good conversation about not being a burden to people. And it was it was it was really nice and lovely. And I feel better about this week. So that's awesome. Thank you, Laura. And on my end, shout out to Pillix, who has been helping me with some technology programming madness. I feel like the last few weeks and co-working we've we've been over like over talking tech and over talking programming and doing all the things. But we're really excited about some of the stuff that we're doing and how that is actually going to come back. And benefit folks listening like you. And now it is time for. Oh, one more piece of feedback. Sorry, I didn't know where to put it. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron, says regarding my connection check, I'm dealing with some stuff which can have a range of different causes, some being diet. And I'm being recommended to cut things like caffeine. And I'm being recommended to take a break from the diet. And I'm being recommended to take a break from the diet. And I'm being recommended to take a break from the diet. All the fun things, all the fun things. Since my diet was overall better than one and a half years ago when this happened before, I wonder if I started having too much caffeine a day, whether stronger coffees or energy drinks or a combo of both. That's rough. That is very, very rough. I would. Yeah, I always like find your one. Find your one and eliminate the others. That's I'm going through a thing called Omada right now that is like a dietary thing. And it is purely because my insurance said you could do it for free. And I was like, sure, why not? But one of the things that they did talk about was like. Cutting anything out is better than cutting nothing out and cutting everything out is really, really hard. So sometimes figuring out the middle ground is. Yeah. At least a start. Yeah. No, that's and that's an easier way to actually do what you want to do, not by overwhelming your brain or anything like being able to just sit and do what you need to do. So, yeah, good luck. And then now, now, now, now, now, now. It's time for the connection check. So Kathy, did you do what you needed to do? I kind of did what I needed to do. My connection check was to sit down and do what I needed to do with the jobs and the changes in the new new business, like new job role things that I needed to do that I need to do. And I did a good part of it. And then I had a bunch of questions and whatnot that I needed. I needed to ask my client for the changes. And he was on. He was gone. So I couldn't finish it. But I did what I could. And I'm mentally wrapping myself around what needs to happen. So good yellow circle for me. Yeah, it must have been the conduit of yellow circles because I I started off strong. I reached out. I talked to people. I asked questions. I got a number. I gave that number a call. I told them what I needed. And then they said, OK. And I never followed up and nothing's happened. So on the plus side, we still haven't had our floor work done. So if you remember in the last episode or if you listen to the last episode, I was stuck between one connection and another. I'm glad I didn't choose the other one because, I mean, ultimately, they're still going to have to come in and rip out the floors. And there has been progress on that, but not as much progress. So we're still in that process of getting those things done and having someone sit here and clean and dust and do stuff just for them to literally rip up our entire flooring that will certainly throw more dust and junk and stuff throughout the house. I definitely didn't want to go through and do that immediately. Yeah. No, that makes that makes sense. But as I scroll through, I'm seeing a lot of green and yellow. So how about our conductors? How did they do? Oh, yeah. Our conductors did great. Our artist of the show, Carly, says connection check green circle. I took the pictures of my art and applied to the grant. Now all I have to do is wait. Fingers crossed. Awesome. And our shark of the show, One Pair of Shoes, says my connection was to take a load of cardboard to the recycling station. Small wins are still wins. Was able to get that done. Good job. Oh, yeah. Small wins are absolutely. Still wins said from. The fact that I have a lot of cardboard in my carport that I need to take to the recycling station that I haven't taken in a while, but that's cool. Mike, our newest conductor who doesn't have an of the show name, but definitely needs one. So, Mike, let us know what you would like your of the show to be. Previous connection green checkmark create and test conduit connection check shortcut. Also, finish catching up on conduit before the next new episode. I'm using the shortcut to post this connection and I'm all caught up on conduit and excited to listen to new episodes as they come out. We're so excited. You made it through 70. Well, now 72 episodes. And so welcome to the conduit train. Also share that shortcut. Don't don't be. Don't be teasing us like that. Yes. Our soprano of the show, Debo, says Greenheart. I sang all of my Holy Week services. Awesome. And yeah, happy post Easter for everyone that had to work during that. I know that's a busy, definitely, definitely busy one. Sure. The of the show says connection check green checkmark. While I haven't booked anything beyond my first hostel, I have finally made a rough itinerary for my entire trip, which is good considering I leave in three and a half weeks. Yeah. Yeah. That's like, hey, a rough itinerary is better than nothing because you have a mental wrapped around like what the plan is for the future. But more importantly, it's flexible so you can make changes when things come up. So congratulations. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Our fish bear of the show, Fishy Kai, says Green Circle water heater installed successfully and some household admin done. I'm amazed that you were able to install a water heater all by yourself. I'm amazed that you were able to install a water heater all by yourself. And I'm kidding. I don't know if that's what you did or not. But also great, great work on that. Great, great adulting. Yes. Our tech podcast listener of the show, Pillock, says Yellow Heart. I got better and applied for jobs, but I didn't work on pod shift. Something else caught my attention and then says ask Jay about it. But this is the incredible transcription. So I think you get a green heart because you just changed your connection to do other things. But also you. Got the first part of it done for the job. So. There's this technical phrase called nerd sniping. I'm very good at it. And that's when you you grab someone's attention and distract them from completing the thing that they were wanting to do because you you like mentioned something or brought something up. Also, I hope the EPA is not at your door. Our Oracle of the show. So says a green book. I finished. Planning my conference presentation with a week to spare. Having a lot of other work to do is a motivating factor. Not me with two conference presentations. I need to complete in the next month. You can do it. Our mountain dweller of the show. Logan Logan says Green Square. As ready as I can be for the baby. We have a room ready. I finished up and handed off work projects. Now it's just a waiting game. So excited for new baby. You better please. If. You're willing and would like to with consent. Share photos. When the baby. Yes. Also, we'll say that, you know, if your connections become a little sporadic, you know, after that, we'll we'll totally understand. Yes. We'll just know that you're dwelling off in the mountains. I think we do have conduit onesies. I think you can. Yeah. If not, we'll make sure that we like make the changes in. The thingy to to to make it to make it happen. Yeah. Looking reach out to us. Send us your address and we'll absolutely get a conduit onesie on the on the list. Definitely. Our robotics engineer of the show. Aiden says green art, not green. I'm color challenged. Our yellow circle. I found the exercise. Square. I wasn't allowed to watch Sesame Street. It was too violent. I found the exercise equipment, but I lost the fight with the garage. Turns out it's too messy for one person to deal with. Totally get that totally. I'm trying to I'm fighting that fight consistently. Just constantly cleaning the garage to prevent it from getting out of control. I'm not only because I do not have a garage. So that's the only the only reason that I don't. I'm not constantly doing that. And finally, our nameless of the show. Nameless is connection. Check green apple. I finalized my program choice for school and submitted all the necessary paperwork in time to start the summer semester. Yay. This episode of Conduit is brought to you by micro dot blog.

So in the pre show, we delved a little bit deeper. But during my trip to L.A., I lost my phone in the fact that it fell and died in the L.A. river. And I was so thankful that I had set up automatic backups through iCloud. For my phone. So when I was able to because normally in the past, when I change phones, I have my other one there. And so I'm able to just do whatever the phone transfer thingy mabobber is, whatever it's called. But obviously, I couldn't do that. So I had to do a backup and I had a backup from the night before. So I did not lose any of my photos from Disney, from Universal, from L.A., from the. State Dance Championships, like all of these things were still there in my phone. And it made me want to discuss backups and especially. Because my camera broke, so I had to use my backup camera for. Like for the state dance championships, like all of these things have happened this month that made me really think about backups. And I'm a knock on wood. Not going to have any other future issues with needing backups of things. But like CGP Gray says, two is one, one is none. And I guess, you know, Merlin Mann and a wide variety of people have the same commentary. But this made me wonder, hey, Jay, do you have backups? Yeah, about that. Why don't you just keep talking? Yeah. OK, OK. I so I do have backups. I don't subscribe to a. Very dedicated backup strategy, so cloud storage is not a backup. I strongly believe that cloud storage is not a backup. I used to have more backups. You can ask Kathy. There were several times in which there was like, hey. You have this like half terabyte of conduit files just sitting in drive that other people like it's taking up everyone else's space. And I'm like, but what if Relay FM shuts down and we don't know what to do? I'm like, well, then we have bigger problems. Right. And I'm like, oh, yeah, you're probably right about that. So since then, since Kathy gave me permission to delete those backups, I just started deleting all the backups. And now. I have a couple of external USB hard drives that I run time machine on one of them. And then I have ultimately that's where all of my like photos and videos from events or when I'm doing photo or video editing. Everything goes on to those external hard drives. And then there's likely a copy of it on my actual machine as well. So in a way, it's kind of. Backed up, especially if you include the time machine backups as well. Yeah. So that's that's kind of my my strategy for backups and that there is no strategy. Everything is very chaotic. And at the end of the day, if I don't have it in one place, I might have it in another. And if it's not there, well, then it just wasn't that important. My heart. My heart hurts. Mainly because I cannot even imagine. Living in that. I if you if you don't know. Hi, I'm Kathy. I have anxiety. Hi, Kathy. I did not used to have anxiety. It came into existence after I gave birth to a surrogate. So I know what it's like to live in a world where you're not having anxiety. And so I I see these things. Happen. And I know that this is not. It's not a logical, rational thing. Especially because if something happens, I know, like, I have these solutions. I have these ways to, like, get things done with hope. But in order to cover issues like if you break your camera in the middle of the biggest weekend. Of your, like, professional photographing career. Making something that will work. And like, you'll get it figured out. Is is great. I had my watch so I could, you know, do the emergency stuff that I needed to do before I got the phone replacement. But also I have Backblaze, not a sponsor. Love them. So great. Especially if a cat. Astrophic. Event occurs. They've got me covered. Hopefully knock on wood. That's all not going to happen. Um, but you never know. And so like, I like having the, uh, like. Backup in place to make sure that I am covered as much as possible. And I would hope that you as well, at least like pictures of your baby. And, and, and important things. I think for me, the, the thing that. Was the issue. Or like the biggest issue. I was joking mostly about Kathy being like, we can delete these files. It's fine. Um, Kathy did say that, but that wasn't why a lot of things broke. It was, um, I too had Backblaze. Backblaze. And then there was this issue where like. My employer was like, Hey. You can't back up your work device with Backblaze because we don't allow that. And I'm like, I hear you. But I still want that stuff. Yeah. Like what's your backup strategy. And they're like, oh, well, we don't care about you enough to, to back up all of your stuff or pay for it. And you can just put it in cloud storage because cloud storage is backup, right? No, it's not. Um. So in that, in that event, it was like, okay, if I have two different computers, one of them is backed up and then the other one is not backed up. And half of the stuff that I work on is like work adjacent. So I. That's the stuff that I want backed up. And the stuff that's on like my personal computer, like I don't, I don't care all that much. Like I said, if, if for some reason, Google drive is down, Apple, uh, I cloud drive is down. And like my cloud providers are down. We have bigger problems. And that, that was very much the, the point of like, all right, I think I'm over this, but what I'm not over is the idea of contingency backups. And, and there, there is this interesting, like puts on former system administrator hat. Like there were things that you would do in terms of like a backup strategy. Like you didn't just back. Up the entire drive every single day and then store that you, you did a combination of, of incremental backups, which are like you back up the changes from one day to another. And then you do differential backups, which are. Like you back up the specific pieces of an individual file that changed. This is what like get hub does, where it says like, oh, you did this thing. And then you did this thing. Like your. Only. You did this thing. And then you do like a backup. And then you do like a backup. And then you can do like a full backup, which is like copy and paste in another location. And I do this in real life. Very, very well. In my opinion, at least in my personal opinion of like. We have printed copies of all of our personal documents that need to happen that are in like a fire safe vault. And then we have our actual documents in like a fire. Protective vault. So like, or fire protective case. So like, it's probably not gonna survive. Like if that's where the fire started, but at the same time, like it doesn't require us to put in a password every time we need to get a passport out or something like that. Um, we also have, you know, we use one password. Uh, we put everything in one password and that isn't like, I know that's not necessarily like a backup thing. But we do have. We do have certain pieces of important information stored in one password. One because it's convenient too, because it serves as a really good place in case we can't remember where we put the thing. Yes. So that makes sense for sure. Yeah. And, and even with this recording for our recording, as I joked about at the beginning of our recording, we have. Like I'm recording my end. Kathy. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording. You're recording her end. I'm recording Kathy's end. I also have a copy of the recording that's both of our ends combined. And then we also have a backup recording of that. So if in the event that something happens with our podcast, there, there is never any reason like Kathy's internet could go out and I have all of my audio in pristine condition. My internet could go out. Kathy has her audio. Kathy has my audio up until that point. I have. have Kathy's audio up, up until that point. And we're able to at least do something. And to me, that like operational backup stuff is way more important than do you have a second copy of that file from 17 years ago? If so, can you send me it? Yeah, yeah. And I think there's something to mind. I don't know about you, but my anxiety brain of like, if I need a copy of my birth certificate, I know where to go. If I need well, for example, my driver's license is also at the bottom of the LA River, along with, you know, two credit cards. Those have already been canceled and replaced and re put back into my Apple Pay wallet and one password for emergencies. Um, but obviously, you can't necessarily have a backup of a driver's license. But what you can do is order it online, and it should be shipped should be mailed here shortly. But I do have the piece of paper that says that I ordered a new one and that hopefully that will work. I also have my driver's license number put in one password. But I also haven't memorized because my brain is weird that way. So I don't know if that's a good thing. I don't know if that's a good thing. But I do have my driver's license number put in one password. So I don't know if that's a good thing. And so I was able to like, if something happens, I have that access to things. And so it's, it's always, it's always. It's always the things that you don't think about when something happens. And you're like, Oh, my goodness, I wish I had had a backup of this. And so this is your reminder to, you know, make sure you have something in place to you. To have backups for things that you might need, whether or not it's, you know, using cloud storage, in addition to, I don't know, zip drives that are stored in a climate controlled, safe storage box for your. Yeah, I don't know. I think I get what you're saying. Like, there's, I think that there is this level of backup that is paranoia that and again, there are. I'm not here to say that the fact that Stephen Hackett has like a video copy of every single keynote from Apple, since the history of keynoting from Apple has taken place is like, Oh, like, no, that's called archival. That is a completely different thing that is like preserving pieces of history. We have that. And if we want to, you know, we would like to see, like, do we even need, like, someone else's part of�llen that we've got such a major amongst all of these hello. sigh consider Ly far too. Myfuroughting the fact that my various content is attached to these graphians are causing as many conflicts as some other content has in the past. but that that has been One of the things that I've talked about with. I, that this is just the kind. Um, you know, what's a, of that is because I'm genuinely not concerned to that point. And I'm also kind of okay with that thing just not existing anymore. If it happens, like I have, I have an account with a podcast service that costs me $200 a year that I hold onto it for partially for archival reasons. So that like my, you know, if someone did want to go back and listen to those podcasts from 10 years ago, I don't know why you'd want to, but technically, yeah, it's there. That part of history is there. But also because I am also preserving other people's podcasts as well. And if I wanted to use that service in the future, to help someone launch a podcast, I can. I have been told though, I am I am under complete like restriction from starting yet another podcast, though. Yes. I have two people who have threatened me within an inch of my life against starting another podcast. One of them is on this show. I'm blinking. I'm plinking for help. Plinking for help. Got it. Yeah. But the there, there is this part of me that is like, I'm okay with having this and it's like, it's is it is a part of it a backup strategy? Yeah, I guess. I mean, it's an it's not a terribly expensive one. But it is it is like, it's not free. And it's not super cheap. But it it's more of like, hey, I'm getting the added benefit of there is this backup here that exists not necessarily the like, it's not the front of mind consideration for doing this. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, whatever your your strategy is, like just making sure that you are doing it purposefully, I think is the important part. That's what that's what I just want to make sure you do. Just be on purpose. Awesome. So this was a this was a shorter one. Was it? I don't think it was. No, this is a good listen, we go until we're done. That's what we do. If you want more of us, I'm a superconductor.com is where you go for that. But I do know what I want more of. And that is our other sponsor. This episode of conduit is brought to you by Ecamm.

Anything with video, you can do it all with the Ecamm app. So I talked about wanting more of it. Quite literally for the last two weeks in a row, I have recorded a meetup that I do using Ecamm. And it's a virtual meetup. It's tied into Discord. And we show up and there's not really a good way to record Discord, right? So what I do is I just record like the one screen that I'm trying to show or the one thing that I'm trying to show. And it's just my live stream. And I'm just like, I'm going to record this one thing that I'm trying to show. And it's just my live stream. And it's just my live stream. And it's just my live stream. And it's just my live stream. And it's just my live stream setup. So I didn't have to change anything. I just had to say like, this is the screen, drag it into Ecamm. And instead of hitting stream to the world, because this is a private event, I just hit record. And then when I was done talking about the thing that I wanted to record, I just stopped the recording. And then from there, I could immediately publish it to YouTube with the click of a button. It was so easy to use. And to be honest, the alternative isn't like I use some other software.

Don't mind me. I love that you're typing. I'm just typing things in the chat. I know. I love it. Yeah, I have three separate trips coming up for three very different events. And as such, I need to make sure that I don't forget any of the pieces for each of those three things. Because I can't just use a generic packing list for everything. I need to make sure that I don't forget things that I don't forget. Now, yes. Are we in a world where I have a credit card and can go buy things? Yes. However, there are some things that are not replaceable or not easily replaceable or like one of a kind that need to be transported to other people that I can't forget. So in order to do that, I'm going to be making my three separate packing lists. And then of course, I have my general, you know, toothbrush, underwear, pajamas, that type of stuff going in. Um, but for the rest of the trip, I'm going to be making my three separate packing lists. And then, um, I'm going to be making my three separate packing lists. And then, for the very specific things of what I need to bring, we're gonna, we're gonna do that. I like it. I like it. What about you? Packing lists. No, I'm kidding. I probably should do a packing list. Honestly, I've got, like you, I have a bunch of trips coming up. But, um, we haven't announced it yet. But I've talked about it on and off in the podcast of, um, I run another community. Um, it's funny, people who build communities tend to build more than one community. I'm learning, um, ask Kathy about the 15 different communities she's responsible for. I think now it's just three, but, um, yeah, uh, the community that I run called black Python devs, uh, has been picked up by a financial host, which means that as of today, um, I can't make any money. Um, I can't make any money. Um, I can't make any money. Um, I can't make any official announcements with who or other things because we're waiting on a press release. That's right. We got press releases. I know, right? Um, yeah, we are officially a U S recognized nonprofit. Um, there's a lot of work that's gotta get done. And, uh, I'm going to say that while I'm also traveling two out of the next three weeks and I'm working on this and I'm also getting ready for a conference, I think. My connection check is going to be, uh, a pull from the last episode that we did or one of the last episodes that we did. And that is to find some expletive Zen. Um, yeah, I, and in this moment, I think the, the thing that I'm going to need is I noticed my hair getting grayer and grayer. Um, and I find myself being extremely tired. Not the same level of excitement that I normally have. Uh, I am, I am in need of something that is going to bring me a little bit of peace and calm and a little bit of social recharging. So find some expletive Zen. Um, it's more than a song. It's a way of life. And hopefully I can find my way into that life. But what about our conductors? Yeah. Our artists at the show, Carly says new connection. Reach out to a friend to grab coffee. I've been isolating myself because I'm unemployed, but I need to get out there and be more social. This is a great, absolutely fantastic one. I'm so excited and I can't wait to hear how it goes. Our chief Swifty of the show, Andrew. Okay. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome chief Swifty. I'm, I'm very interested to figure out who's going to fight for that name. Oh yeah. I've, I've already, uh, on it, but you know what? It's fine. I will allow you to have this Andrew, because I am a kind and generous and benevolent host. Also Miley Cyrus is better cough. Oh, um, anyway, wow. This is not a conversation because Beyonce is better than both of them, but also, oh dude, did you listen to cowboy Carter? I'm sorry. We're going to just, I listened to the one that is, it's called what to something, something, something with Miley Cyrus. Oh, okay. Yeah. Also good. Fantastic. Great song, but oh my gosh. So good. I've heard good things. Also, congratulations to Beyonce. Not that you need it from us, uh, for like the most like streamed album in a single day on like Spotify. It's so anyway, moving on. Our chief Swifty of the show, Andrew says new connection, sort and organize my two sort file on my computer. I used to have a two sort file. Maybe you should back that two sort file up that way. That's the word up back, back this. No, I'm done. Sorry. Sorry. Uh, our pathologist of the show, Laura says new connection work more, but do less build in significantly more open space, flex time in my schedule by simply putting less on it each day. Simultaneously come in just a few minutes earlier and stay a few minutes later to allow time for planning and shut down. Oh, that is a great idea. Like being able to build in that space for the time that you need to really get into it is fantastic. Great idea. And our shark of the show, one pair of shoes says my connection for next time is to clear up a bag of old documents. I don't know why I was thinking an old bag of chips. I was like, clean up the old chips, um, clean up the old bag of documents, uh, that need to either be file shredded or just, uh, recycled. Some of it goes back when I lived in a different state. Awesome. Um, you, you got this best of luck on the cleanings and our Mike of the show who will get our of the show name to us for the next connection. Check says new connection finish restructuring to do his tasks. So I have the framework to achieve my goals for the year without having to constantly fiddle with my system. I've already started working on my to-do list cleanup, but want to get this over and over again. So I'm going to go ahead and do that. So I'm going to go ahead and do that. So I can spend time getting things done instead of just reorganizing my tasks. Yes, that makes sense. And I am so excited for you to get that going. And our Panda of the show, James says, I'm going to be taking a break from doing connections for a while. Uh, I have some family health stuff happening right now. That's going to dominate my thinking for the foreseeable future. Hopefully I will be back, but I wanted to say goodbye for next time. I love you all, James. I will absolutely miss you. I will miss our arguments, but I also understand. And I hope that everything happens, uh, goes smoothly. And, um, I hope we get to have you back with a big smile. And, uh, then I will proceed to continue to talk trash about pandas, but not until then. Yes. Good plan. Good plan. Our Soprano of the show, uh, Debo says next connection. Remember to vote in the town election. Oh, that, that, uh, uh, rhymed. Oh, next connection vote in the town. Yeah. Okay. I was like, it did. I know. The, uh, of the show, uh, uh, says I have exactly two weeks left. I'm going to have to wait until I finish university for good. Wow. Congratulations. Um, including two projects, two final exams, a lab report and a presentation. Okay. So going out with a bang. I like it. I like it. Plan survive. Perfect. Chef's kiss. You got this. Love it. Come on, do it. You can't do it. Our fish bear of the show. Fishy Kai says new connection to finish filing my taxes. Still a bit to do. I don't know why, but taxes take so much energy. It's because you're scared that, that somebody is going to come pounding on your door and try and take you to jail or that you're going to do something wrong and get charged an absolute ridiculous like fee. So I get it. It's scary, but also it's totally not. It's fine. Anything can be fixed. Said from somebody that client does taxes for a living. And so I'm very familiar with the backend stuff. Definitely in the world of like, yeah, taxes. It would be nice if they just did it for us. Like other countries. Yeah. And our tech podcast, listener of the show, pill likes says, uh, keep applying for jobs and actually try to work on pod shift this time. That's what you think. I'm kidding. You can do it. Our Oracle of the show. So says next connection. My to-do list is ridiculous. So I'm just aiming to get through as much of it as possible.
