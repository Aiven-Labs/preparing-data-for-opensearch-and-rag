From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we can do our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that gets to put things like Lorem Ipsum, Pikachu, Conduit in our show notes and nobody can stop us. This episode is brought to you by Micro.blog. I'm Kathy and with me today, as always, is the most amazing co-host ever because he tracks when our systems check episodes are. It's Jay. The spoiler alert. I used to have them on a big calendar. I've since removed that calendar. So yeah, we got lucky on this. It's true. It's true. That's important. I should probably, oh, I should maybe put them on my big calendar, which reminds me I need to change it because I only have through April on there. I need to work on that. Okay, I'm writing that down in my system, which is what we're going to talk about this episode but not right now because first we're going to talk about shout outs. Before we do that, I wanted to ask, can we make it a habit? That at the beginning of system checks, we kind of identify what a system check is and why we do it only because I do worry that people will be like, oh, systems check. That's cool. I don't know what that means. And if they see it multiple times, maybe they'll think it's something that it might not be. I mean, I was going to talk about that before we actually did our systems check, not necessarily at the start of the show, but we could do it at the start of the show. That's fine. It's your show. No, no, that's a good idea. Before people get into it, I guess, maybe. Hey, Jay, what's a systems check? The systems check was this idea that we're your average productivity fan. We like a good productivity app, some tools, some systems, some themes, but we don't want to prioritize constantly talking about new hotness, what we've been trying, what we've been doing. One, we want to give ourselves time to work through some of the things that we're trying out. But we also want the ability to talk about the things that don't exist within the system and themes. That said, we also understand that you want it. You want the goodness. You want the apps. You want the tips and the tricks. So it's like, yeah, we make a special time every quarter to make sure that we do a systems check, which is kind of that routine maintenance for what we're doing. We take stock, we take inventory, and we share that with one another and with our conductors. We share even more with our super conductors and it gives us the ability to, one, just nerd out with each other, but then two, also maybe get a little bit of inspiration from people in the audience that are trying new tools or one of the other co-hosts who I saw went to one of my favorite apps of all time and then another app. So we'll see. We'll see. We'll get there. We'll get there. Well, and two, the reason that we do this quarterly and something that I think is important to think about is that you don't have to do something the same way forever. And it's important to be willing to try new things if you are finding that you're missing something or if something's not working. And that's kind of a perfect timing for me to talk about that in the future. But it's not time yet because we're doing our shout outs now. Hey, Jay, is it okay now to do our shout outs before we move on? Yeah, let's do shout outs. Yeah, so our first shout out comes from Aaron, our identical twin of the show. Jay Aaron says, I appreciate Kathy saying 42 as an answer multiple times on episode 42. It was almost like we had been looking forward to that episode for a long time, at least 41 episodes. To hear that joke again, check out episode 42. 42. Yep. I have a shout out to the absolutely incredible superconductors that hung out with us on our co-working time last week because I signed up to do a 200th episode of the game show podcast on The Uncomparable. Back in 2018, I did episode 100, which was a beautiful chaotic disaster. And this past Saturday, we recorded episode or the 200th episode. And it was also a beautiful chaotic disaster. And especially with the round of very interesting mashups that the superconductors helped me with. It was absolutely so much fun. And I truly from the deepest soul bottom of my heart, I could not have done it without them. All of them were so supportive and incredible. Did anyone get my favorite quip, which was from Russia with love me tender? No. Okay. We didn't do that. You didn't do that one? No, not that one. No. Okay. No, but that's okay. That's okay. We just had a great time and I can't wait for the next one because who knows what's going to happen next week. And so if you're listening to this, I already said it once, but I'm going to say it again. Superconductor, come and hang out with us. February 28th at 10 a.m. Pacific time. Unfortunately, I don't have else when for audio, which is a great app that I highly recommend if you need to send a link in discord that has numbers or like dates, not numbers, not just general numbers that has a date and you want the people that are seeing it to see it in their time. That's incredible. Thank you, Sky in the chat in the live stream chat. 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern, 1800 UTC. Sky, you are my living embodiment of elsewhere, I guess. But we appreciate everyone that comes. And if you can't come, that is also okay because we appreciate you. But if you're not a superconductor, guess what? You're still a conductor and we heart you deeply. So thank you for listening to the show. Did someone get how Stella got her emperor's new groove back? That wasn't even remotely part of the questions. So no, do you? Listen, I've been thinking a lot about these. I can go down some of them if you would like. Some of the mashups after show after show. OK, we'll do it for the superconductors. I will save it for the superconductors. If you want to hear a sneak peek, I guess, of the show that will be on a different network in the future that you can listen to, it's fine. We'll listen to or stick around for the after show, I guess. But we love all of our Relay FM members, especially the ones that are in our Discord. It's a great community that lets you meet other like minded fans of the network. And in the Discord, we record this show live every fortnight and you can hang out in the give us a time zone in person information while we do the show and interact as well as be exposed to some of our behind the scenes shenanigans, which you can also get if you can't make it that time. You can also get if you become a superconductor. And if you would like to become a superconductor, go to I am a superconductor. I am a superconductor. Oh, no, it's I am a. Oh, my goodness. What is our URL? I'm a is that I'm a. It's not in the thing. You got me. Yes, it is. You got me messed up. Okay, I know. I'm sorry. I'm heavier. Letter I letter M letter a superconductor. I'm a superconductor because I am a superconductor is being parked by someone for some reason. So you could if you go to I'm a superconductor dot com and enough of you do it and become superconductors, maybe we can secure I am a superconductor dot com from the evil clutches of Dr. No. Dr. Oh, no. Yeah. So I'm a superconductor dot com. You can join and become a part of our superconductor family. Another way to support us is by visiting you can wear it. That's Y O U C O N W E A R I T dot com. Check out our merch options. We have shirts and hoodies and baby onesies and also stickers, which are pretty great. If I say so myself. And that's all the shadows that we have right now. So let's move on to our connection check. That sounds like it was just your phone buzzing, but that's fine. I'm assuming that's a zap. Jay, how did you do on your connection? So this was a roller coaster of emotion here. My connection check was to take my vitamin D every day. And I said that it had to be every day, otherwise it was going to be a failure. I failed. And then I succeeded so magnificently that I counted it as a green check anyway. And I want to attribute that to 100 percent our superconductors in our Tuesday, you know, session that we do. I talked about kind of falling off the train a little bit when it came to remembering to take my vitamin D supplements and my health being able to suffer because of it. And that's not being great. And we talked about several different ideas, one that included quite literally duct taping a vitamin D bottle to extension cord and taping it to the door so that when I opened the door, it would hit me in the face. And what happened was, no, I did not do that. I did tape it to the cord for a while and it was there, but I eventually untaped it. But what happened was I left the power cord out. And every time I looked over and saw the power cord, I did two things. I giggled a little bit because I'm that kind of human being. But then I also said, I'm going to go take my vitamin D supplement now. And since that Tuesday, I have not missed a single day taking my vitamin D supplements because of that. And it was it was one of these moments of like we talked about this so much, like there were so many great ideas that were pitched, including like alarm clocks that require you to like take photos that match a matching algorithm that will only turn it off if you can do that. And again, all of this stuff is great until you wake up your daughter, you wake up your partner, you know, and all these other things. So being able to to play in the in the funny universe that I sometimes make for myself, that's just like, no, I can't set 15 alarms. No, I can't just put the bottle on the dresser next to me. So it's the first thing that I see. No, I can't stick it in my underwear drawer, which I don't know, some weird unicorn made that suggestion. Like, eventually it got to leave a power cord on the desk next to you so that you giggle and then immediately go take your vitamin D supplement afterwards. Wow, that is impressive. And I wonder how that will work for the long term. Like we discussed on the stream. ADHD brains tend to. Like, ignore things if they stay in the same spot for too long. And since the power cord is not moving, it'll be really interesting to see. I hope it works really well. I hope it continues to be the perfect solution for you. Well, if it doesn't, I have a couple of I have a giant Funko of Agri-tsuko and I have pint size from questionable content, and they both have hands for holding. So they might just hold the vitamin D bottle next. Perfect. I love it. I love it. What about you, Kathy? Yeah, my connection was to clear out two of the boxes that have been living behind my couch, between my couch and my kitchen table for a very long time. I did more than that. I actually did four boxes and helped my kiddo clean out a couple of their boxes that they had to go through. And I now can see the kitchen from any seat on the couch, which is a big deal because it was higher than the pile was higher than the couch. That's we didn't talk about the thing that we were. I said we were going to talk about before the show. Oh, man. OK, we'll talk about it after the show or we'll talk about it in the after show. Man, the after show is going to be chock block of stuff. But yeah, I'm glad that we were able to get these things that ultimately were like, oh, man, it's so nice to have that done. And for those that want the teaser, I'm just going to say bathtub and leave it at that. And we'll we'll see how many people figure out what I'm referring to by the end of the show. I don't know what you're talking about, so I love it. Let's go. Speaking of connections, Jay, who how do what? So Adam, our reader of the show, I only did that so that Javier could not cut that out because that was wonderful. No. Javier, our reader of the show, says that Adam, our reader of the show, Javier, our amazing editor of the show, will hopefully fix that and or leave it in. I don't know. But Adam, our reader of the show, says connection check. Orange book. I was going to say, is that orange or just yellow? I didn't learn from every core from the course every day, but I was able to apply what I learned from the course to fixing a bug at work. And I got distracted by another course. Hey, I like that. I like that. We were like, all right, didn't didn't get where we wanted, but we were able to use what we got. So good job. Absolutely. Our soprano of the show, Deborah, has a connection check green checkmark found one of Mark's old laptop bags in the bag graveyard in our attic, which is perfect for my work laptop and is nicer than the company issued one I had. Well, congratulations on the bag graveyard having a use. Aren't you glad you didn't get rid of that? Mm hmm. I have to get rid of moving on. Anyway, our civil engineer of the show, Dan, says connection check green heart. I have successfully rested, recovered and feel motivated to get back into learning and working. I have had so many days off in the last few weeks. I totally feel this. Oh, my goodness. I am ever more. If only we could make four day work weeks a thing, I would 100 percent be on board. But good job, Dan. What's a what's a four day work week? I don't know. Yeah, that's when you work four days in your work week and you get an extra day relaxing. Studies show that it doesn't affect productivity at all. And all it does is boost morale of your employees. So, hey, interesting. Nice. Our mountain dweller of the show, Logan, has a green tree. Everything is bought with money flying away, except for the paint. I have a plan of what needs to happen when and I even started building the cabinets to get ahead. Yes, Logan. Super excited for you. Share photos in the home channel, please. Our mudkip of the show, Nadia, says connection check green heart. I played so much Mario Kart Double Dash and moved up to the top 500. Oh, that's awesome. I had some close calls with my schoolwork, but I got it all done in time. Hey, I'm loving it. That's awesome. Congratulations. Amazing. Our panda of the show, James connection check green checkmark, successfully turned 50 since the last time I wrote one of these and had a small party to celebrate, which was surprisingly enjoyable. Have not succumbed to angst about my advancing years too much. Also designed a million T-shirts, launched a merch store and finally shipped the conduit dice about time. Now I'm just kidding. I'm so excited. You don't know. Yeah, it's in. It's in. Update. Update your app. Dice by PCALC. I had the button already because James let us be fancy. And I'm just going to roll and it said, what would Kathy do? Kathy would keep going with this with what we're doing now. Good. Good job, James. Our blue dragon of the show, Sky says blue heart survived and have tried to build some tools that help me deal with anxiety. Oh, wow. As always, I look forward to hearing about these in our sibling show that is FMD. Yes. I don't know why I'm having such trouble with like, oh, today. Oh, oh. Oracle, our Oracle of the show. So as connection check, green apple. This time I managed to meditate five times a week, both weeks. Second chances are great. Absolutely. So proud of you. The nameless of the show with the name of Robert says connection check green circle. I have a day set for recording. For some reason, setting up an actual day made me nervous, but it's in the calendar. That's the first step. You know, what's next? You got this. You can do it. Our final connection of the episode, it comes from our train enthusiast, Railsie connection check green checkmark and a superconductor session attended. I've started to plan a custom journal, not entirely sure how. Wait, is that all done? Nope. Just kidding. I've started to plan a custom journal, not entirely sure how I want to do my reviews. Memory and my understanding is weird. So not entirely 100 percent, but I'll take the green for my two weeks of read. Absofrickinlutely. Good job. So proud of you. Hey, Kathy, do we have something awesome to talk about? We do. This episode of Conduit is brought to you by Micro.Blog. Blogging is still the easiest way to share stuff on the web, and Micro.Blog is the easiest way to blog. Personal blogging is making a comeback thanks to all the disruption in social media. So if you have always wanted to build your own place on the Internet to keep and share the stuff you love, Micro.Blog is for you. Micro.Blog is the blog you will actually use because we've made it so easy to write short or long blog posts, share photos, keep a log of the books you read and even create your own podcast.

It's the social network you can feel good about. And because Micro.Blog is open, you can use your own domain name, cross post to Twitter, Tumblr and Mastodon. You can also follow and be followed by Mastodon users directly with conversations threaded across both Micro.Blog and Mastodon. And finally, you can share your RSS feed so anyone can follow you. Now, Jay, I hear you have a Micro.Blog account, is that correct? Yeah, I do. And I have a blog and I have a micro blog and I have a Micro.Blog and I have a Twitter account and I have a Mastodon account. And you know what? I'm tired of it, Kathy. There's just too many places and too many things to keep up with. If only there was a way that I could just write to one place and then let that service send it all the other places for me so that I don't have to think about it anymore. Oh, wait, Micro.Blog does that. Oh, hey, I will have to work with the amazing people at Micro.Blog who I have been following for years and I am. I'm so excited for this moment in time for them. But I'll have to work with them to make sure I get all of that set up. Yes. Micro.Blog hosting starts at five dollars per month. Head to Micro.Blog and sign up for the 30 day free trial.

That's five dollars a month for hosting that includes all of our premium features, including podcast hosting. That's a savings of 50 percent. Our thanks to Micro.Blog for their support of this show. And all of Relay FM. So it's time for our systems check. I didn't say thanks. Oh, I'm sorry. But that was my fault because my mic was muted. I have decided I want to learn how to say thanks in a lot of different languages. So I'm going to mess this up royally. And in Ilocano, I'm going to say Aguiamï¿½n. Oh, nice. All right, Jay, it's time for our systems check. I was going to say to to to to to to. Oh, I like that. To do ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding. You know, the sound that like the sound that trains me. Yeah. Yeah. Check it, check it, check it, check it, check it, check it, check it, check it, check it, check it, check it. To do. Oh, no, that's fantastic. Yeah, we did it. Chugga Chugga to do. OK, I put that in for the title because that was hilarious. I love how when we created the name of the show, we were like electric and, you know, the actual cables and conduit and things. And it's kind of transitioned into like a train show, which just entertains me so much because I love good branding. And I think we have the best. Now, only we can get the conduit logo with like one of those Thomas the Tank Engine faces on it. That might traumatize me. So let's not let's just embrace our hat instead. I like it. I like it. All right. So, Jay, remind, if you can, everyone of what you did before or not, if you don't remember and what you're doing currently. I mean, I just Domi method and was basically trying to keep up with some of the fast pacedness of of my work. And a lot of that was moving things just kind of in my notebook to live ephemerally and having big pieces of paper to also live ephemerally. And Kathy, my productivity has been a hot mess. But I think we're at like we're at like a turning point now that I'm really, really excited about. One, the Domi method still exists. I am still adding things to my notebook ephemerally. And I am doing more brain dumps. I'm doing more just get it all out. As as we talked about kind of in the in the pre show a little bit, I have had a little bit of trouble sleeping because my head is full of ideas. And I've been working to get all of those things out of my my head. And what I've kind of come to terms with is that there are a few different stages in my productivity space, I guess. And one of them is like what you do and what you did. What you do and what you did is is very much that dopamine of like, hey, if you feel like you didn't do anything today, go back and look at that, you know, tiny rapid log of like, here's all the stuff that you accomplished. Good job. You did it. But then also the you still got to do these things. You still need to be accountable for these things. So I've I've not really adopted any project management stuff. There was going to be this gigantic conversation about this app that I got beta access to. But one, I didn't feel like it was fair to talk about it because not everybody has access to it. And two, I still haven't quite identified where, if at all, it's it would live in my system. So just know that there might be some conversation about that in the future. But right now, I have gone to mind mapping again, which is really interesting. And the only reason this came up was I was presented with an opportunity to take charge of probably one of the biggest work assignments of my career. And this this is a step in kind of a management idea and being responsible for what are hundreds of thousands of dollars invested into something. And being responsible for that gave me a whole lot of anxiety. So I needed a way to quickly be able to visualize all of the different steps, be able to tag them and focus down and filter and do a bunch of things. And I just got to say, like, I've used my node for several years. Just as kind of a way to like quickly visualize things. When you start using it and really trying to dive deep into that application, there are a lot of really nice, subtle features that make working in it very, very pleasing. In fact, it was easy enough to start like really rough, no color, just get all the stuff onto the screen and then send a picture of that to my boss. And then like an hour and a half later, send another picture of it. Very manicured, color coded, organized really well, tagged really well, being able to zoom into certain areas and then send that to him. And his response was, wait, is that the same thing? Oh, wow. Amazing. So, yeah, my node gets a big shout out because for the next few months, I'm definitely going to be working in it as I manage this this mammoth of a project. And it's interesting in that it didn't necessarily need to take the place of anything in my system. It was, oh, I have this thing that has a lot of moving parts. I can go down the list and just see and then check in with people and answer the questions and then also keep my personal productivity, you know, separate from all of that. But it's also been giving me kind of the inspiration to use mind maps, to look at other complex systems with a sense of sensibility to them, I guess. I think that's a book, right? The sense of sensibility. And I'm sure. Yep. Yeah, I think I think Jane Austen wrote it or something. J. Austin, J. Austin. Yeah. So, yeah, there's that's that's kind of been the big thing for me. My mapping has has kind of made a quick little comeback into my space. I find that really interesting because mind mapping does not work for me whatsoever. I cannot wrap my brain around mind mapping. I just it does not compute. And so I'm always extra impressed whenever anybody can not only do a mind map, but do a mind map that is like cleaned up and and I'm sure very pretty with different colors and stuff. And that's really like special. So good job. Not that you need permissions for me, but like I I it's it's funny how adding something to your system can add on instead of change, if that makes sense. And that's kind of where I am, too. So I am back in the bullet journal vibe like I was previous like at the last systems check talked about getting into it. I am definitely using it more consistently because on days and even weeks that I don't. Do it. I am floundering and loss, and I don't feel like I'm as productive as I should be. But also, I'm not tracking as well the things that I've done. So if I there's no way for me to really turn around and say, oh, you clearly have been working really hard because look at all of these tasks that you've done. Which one of my clients is a CPA. And if you don't know, here in the US, we are in prime tax return season, which means my daily to do list is basically tax returns and then everything else gets done, too. And so this actually is the perfect time for me to see about adding something else to my system. And I'm looking to add something digital for longer term projects and longer, like things for future planning almost instead of having pages in my planner or notebook that are like, this is for future. Like being able to have something that says, OK, here's the longer term plan for this really big project that I am not sure I can really talk about yet, but also is really exciting. And. I am. Just like it's so exciting, but it's also going to take over a lot of not free time because I don't have free time, but it's going to take a lot of big planning. Free time, what's that? I know. That's called podcast time. Yeah. So originally I was like, oh, I'll switch back to OmniFocus, except I realized that my I'm a version behind on my upgrade, and I don't necessarily want to pay for a subscription as as expensive as it is for something that I'm not. What version are you on? Well, I think the last version I bought was for three and they're on four. They're not on four yet. Four is still in beta. So, OK, so I was I was on two and now they're in three. And so I don't have an active subscription. Oh, yeah. And if you were even considering it, I would I would say wait until four, which like is a good thing to do. But instead of doing that and not dealing with that big change, I think I'm going to either use Todoist in a different way than I currently am, which right now is just like writing down, like having a central place for ideas and that sort of stuff. Or maybe notion, which has a lot of the things that I need to do, which is like just kind of. A place to dump stuff and then assign things or maybe something else that I haven't thought of yet. And this has literally just come in my brain in the last like three days. And and I'm trying to figure out how that will work for me. And so it's always interesting to be in this like. Limbo for the bigger projects to track and keep an idea of what's going on and see how I can add that to my system. And of course, in the show notes, we'll have links to all of the stuff, including like. So with my bullet journal, I've actually am using my fountain pens on it instead of just for journaling. And so I'll include the links to the pen and ink that I use for that, in case anybody cares, which I'm sure they do, because y'all are my people. And it's fun to have those things in there, I guess. One of the things I find really interesting is that both of us are. Addressing long term problems in different ways, but also in a holding pattern, like I said, I kind of mentioned this other app that. If if it were to be adopted, it is very much in that same realm of a notion like, hey, I need to hold on to these things for the long term and maybe address them as they pop up or, you know, add a little bit of. Like system around it, which I think is is really, really unique in how they've done it. But also that means I don't have a baseline to think about it from. But I do love the idea of using like one you had to do is, which is a tool that you already use. But then thinking about how you use it and maybe trying something different. Of course, I will I will suggest probably the most knowledgeable person about notion would be Karl Pullein. Who is someone that I've spoken with plenty of times on previous shows and stuff. And he has a good YouTube channel. But the other option with notion notion is definitely one of those those apps that are like. I struggled to recommend notion to people that aren't ready to use notion for like everything. Yeah. And that that's like the one fear that I have. That's the fear that I have with that other app, too. And that's why I liked the idea of something like a mind node, which I know for you, you said mind mapping doesn't work. Yeah. So definitely not not a solution there. But is there it seems like you have like the thing I'm already using, but maybe I use it differently. And then there's like there's this thing that. It involves a lot of investment. Is there something in the middle? And that was where, you know, before I put everything into my node, I actually put it into task paper because I could write it in drafts and then use like drafts as the task paper view. And like I had that outline of stuff. And then I was able to just grab outlines or pieces of that outline and put them into to my node, you know, blocks and kind of work with them that way. I'm wondering if there's a maybe like an in-between of like if you're going to use to do is maybe you outline your you measure in in some other tool. And then when you're ready to to execute on it, you then move it into your quote unquote trusted system. I can see that being a possibility. However, I am worried about having. That extra step of moving anything, like I know that that probably will cause me to not necessarily. Use it as often because I would need to do additional work, if that makes sense, whereas if I'm moving things around in the same app, that's a little bit different or website or whatever I'm doing. For my brain, that doesn't feel. Wrong. And so possibly task paper, I don't like I said, I don't actually know what the right answer is for this. And the idea, the idea of like figuring it out, basically, I want something that just works and I want something that works the way that I need it to. And being able to do quick entry and then assign it into like stuff that needs to go. I don't know. I don't even know specifically what I want so much as I know that something needs to change and something needs to happen. And so I need to work on that. Well, you know, one of the things that I spoke a lot about during the pre show was in the in the disarray that is my website, also see our our sponsor read. And one of the things that I've tried to do is use drafts as kind of that holding place. And that that's because drafts has just been the consistent place where tech starts, which is I think that's its slogan. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the cash. So I have drafts, but I don't use it. So maybe that's what I need to do. And the only reason I think about that is drafts has actions. And I'm pretty sure it has a built in to do is action. I'm checking now, but you can make a quick yeah, you can make a quick action that just adds a task to to do is. So even if you just you want to add a bunch of stuff and you have a bunch of ideas and then eventually you need that idea to make its way into. Your trusted system that you already have, and they also have a notion API, too. So like you can you can add it to notion relatively easy. You can add it to do is relatively easy. But you the thing that I'm worried about is both of these things are going to require you to think about how. That system is designed and how you're using it and if you're using it in a way that it's designed for or not designed for, but in a way that your brain has already started designing it. And the scary part with that is that. If you start changing a bunch of stuff, you can run the risk of breaking what was working for you in the process of trying to fix what you have to add. Right. And that's definitely concerning because I don't want to make it a thing that becomes overwhelming or makes it to where the rest of my stuff isn't working because I don't have it configured correctly, you know, or like adding this in is supposed to help not take away. And so I'm it's scary in a way that's not like super. Like, I'm not. Oh, my gosh, I'm not going to have an anxiety attack, but it's nerve wracking to add things in and have it disrupt what is working. So that's why I'm trying to to take it like make the choice not too seriously, but also to make it easier but also to maybe. Like, try and break, like throw something in and just try it and see if it works. And if it doesn't work, try something else in a way that won't necessarily take a ton of configuration. So I'm I'm hoping to to be able to sit and and see what's going to work. And I'm thankful that we had the systems check to kind of like help me figure that out in a way that will be hopefully really successful for these things in the future that is exciting. I encourage everyone listening, if you are maybe considering changing up your system or, you know, things are working really well. I do one of these, I mean, honestly, do do a systems check with us if it's not designed for you to say, I need to throw everything out. It is more what's what's the the state of things. And it's funny because we're recording this like a few weeks after the state of the union happened. So in my mind, I'm like, you know. OK, OK, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to tell a story for my military days. And it'll be it'll be great. So I was deployed on this ship. We called it the steaming deuce because it was LHD to class and the thing caught on fire a few times. Oh, my gosh. It was if you imagine a giant ship where fire things happened. But what we did, you know, they have these things called cleaning quarters. And it's these moments when you're everybody stops what they're doing and you clean like this is a naval traditional thing. Like it happens. Everyone is expected to clean no matter your rank. Even the highest ranking people have things that they're responsible for maintaining. And there was this incident where a key part of the ship's engine failed. And of course, people were wondering like, oh, you know, how does that happen? And you know, what's going to happen? You know, all this other stuff. What had happened was someone cleaning the ship. Left a 50 cent rag, a little cheap rag in between the gears that they were cleaning. In between the gears that they were cleaning in the engine room. And the friction from that rag. Caused overheating and breaking. Oh, my gosh. So 50 cent rag cost millions of dollars of damage. Yeah. And when you say that seems a little careless, like. Here's the thing. Inspections were supposed to happen. Anybody during that inspection could have seen the rag sticking out and been like, hey, that I don't think that goes there. That doesn't look right. Yeah, we need to tuck this away and put it there. And that was the thing is we don't we don't necessarily assign blame. We we look at it of like, how can this be prevented in the future? Right. And and I say all of this to say, like. Usually when there's a problem, there's a rag sticking out somewhere that if you're not taking specific time to inspect these things, might get stuck in your engine and cause way more damage than what you thought. And it takes a few minutes of time to just take a look at everything and go, is is everything in order, is everything sorted out, is everything operating the way that it's supposed to be? And if it's not, do we know, do we know about it? Have we taken stock of it? And do we understand what the repercussions of that are? And I'm not here to say that, you know, oh, I found, you know, a minor flaw. Time to throw out everything. But it's time to address the minor flaws that might exist because minor flaws can become much larger flaws when left unchecked. Yes, that is so true. And the the thing I like to say when I'm talking to clients or friends or whatever, you know, when it comes to like looking at how you're doing things and getting things done, not the TM TM TM version. If things are getting missed, something needs to change. And it's it's safe to remind yourself that mistakes happen. And if you miss something like a rag sticking out and things caught on fire, taking that as a learning opportunity to figure out how to get it to not happen again, instead of complaining to yourself and yelling at yourself for making those mistakes. Because mistakes happen. This is not like no one is perfect and no system is perfect. 100% of the time. And being kind to yourself is the most important thing. So please be kind. As always, ending on a sentimental note. With that, Jay, what is your connection for the next fortnight, a la conduit? So I've been thinking about this. There is a lot happening again slowly. And there are things that I want to do. Again, slowly. Uh huh. Uh huh. And I feel as if I might have to make a difficult now is not the time. Conversation happen. And I kind of have to choose between one of two. And I'm afraid I'm afraid. So I'm putting it out here that I will I will have the now is not the time conversation with someone. And. Yeah, that that's going to be my connection is this is not a nice way to tell me that you want to stop doing this. Oh, no, no, no. We've we've had so Kathy, we've had a good run. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not at all. Not trust me. What I'm what I'm hoping to do is to protect conduit and some of the things that are. Perhaps more important to me. than some of these little things that I would love to invest time and energy into. But I just honestly, I feel like it was one of those, it's like in the movie scenes where they're like, you might be wondering how I got here. And then I was like, actually, yes, I am wondering how I got here. So yeah, I think in terms of in the next connection, I probably need to have that tough conversation. And I am afraid that I may not do it. So do you need some accountability and like pushing or like checking in on you? Or is this something that you are scared to do because it's not quite the right time? I'm afraid to do it because I'm worried about the side effects of how it will impact other people, but also impact potential opportunities. And that is hard. Yeah. Yeah, that's really difficult. It is me saying, Jay, it's OK to be a little selfish, but also being incredibly concerned about what that selfishness will require. Yeah, that's a really good point. Well, good luck. I can't wait to talk about it in two weeks. Yeah. What about you? So mine, I know I feel better when I do my morning pages and I write my to do list down. I know this, and yet all last week I didn't do it. And so as part of my systems check, I am going to do my morning routine, my morning get ready with me work routine every day that during the week, I'm not going to do it on the weekends because I'm not I'm doing my best to not work on the weekends for work work. I do other projects on the weekends and instead I'm going to do it during the week. And that is my plan. I like a good morning page. Yeah, me too, especially because I set like a timer instead of the number of pages that I have to write. And so some days I write more, some days I write less. I don't feel like I have to have to fill the pages. And speaking of filling the pages, I did get to buy new notebooks because I filled up my other notebook. And so it was fun to get one because I needed the lines. Most of my notebooks have the dot grid. And so I needed the lines for writing the words. And so that was really exciting to give myself permission to buy a new notebook. I was I was going to save this for the post show, but I think it fits here. You just gave me a wonderful systems and our systems check additional idea of a thing that I need to be doing. I've been trying to work with, like not a roma therapy, but I guess a roma therapy, like certain smells putting me in the right mood to get work done and things. Focus mode if you. Sure, we'll go with that. I recently got a downflow incense burner, which doesn't downflow incense burning as well as I thought it would. So it might get replaced. Yeah, I'm not as an asthmatic. The last thing I need is a bunch of smoke in the air. I also bought an air purifier next to it. But these things have like a maybe a five to 10 minute burn time. Each of these cones, I could use that as a way to signify like this is not work time. I mean, it's work time, but it is like think about your day. Think about the things that need to happen. Right plan do. I think that was the book. But using that as a non digital or, you know, loud noise timer of just like while the incense burns, use this time to meditate, to think about all the things you have coming up to plan your stuff for the day, to get yourself together and to prepare yourself to conduit. I really like that idea. That is a really good idea. Yeah, I'm going to try that out. I've been using my couch in a way that. You've been burning your couch. Yes, exactly. Five minutes a day. I set a couch on fire. No, silly. There's a spot like instead of being in my office because I previously I was doing my morning pages like in the in my little chair that I have in the back of my office, back of my office, like it's a huge space. It's it's not a huge space, but in one of the corners, I have a chair. The problem is, is it was so close to the computer that I'd be like, oh, I'll just log in and like check the emails and see if there's something I need to do. And that would derail the whole day. And so by not so I come into my office to get my notebooks and my pen and then I go back out and I sit on the couch and I drink my coffee while I do the stuff. The dogs usually come and lay down next to me or on top of me, depending on which dog and which day. And I just kind of have this moment to sit with what my day, what I want it to look like, what I want it want to get done. And it's really helpful. And so I by like putting this out there, I will have accountability to keep doing it. All right, let's jump into our conductor's connections and let's start with our reader of the show, Adam. His next connection is learn from the course that he paid a lot of money for. Yes, you already have. You've been doing the work. So I'm proud of you. Yeah, just keep keep learning from the course. Yes. Soprano, the show, Deborah says, finish building the baby quilt for friends and then send it off to them. So this is this is super important. It's not just finish the thing, but finish the thing and also like call it call it done by shipping it. Yes. Our civil engineer of the show, Dan, he is going to get back into some more mindfulness and cleaning routines. The bad weather has knocked him out of it a bit and he needs to get back on it. Sounds like we're, you know, getting back on that on that train, on that bike, on that trail. I don't I'm going to stop now. Logan, our mountain dwellers of the show, as I like to refer to Logan, says with no idea when the house build will be done. It's a bit hard to plan. So I'm going to practice being flexible and pacing myself. I was reading pacing around the room. I'm pacing myself to prevent the another flare up of my autoimmune disease. Build one cabinet a day and focus on getting one to two things done at work each day. OK, so this is this is throwing me off, Logan, because you're like, yeah, I'm going to take it easy. You know, I understand that we can't really plan. I'm going to build one cabinet a day. And as our as our premium members will soon learn, it takes me a year to probably do that much work. But good job, Logan. You can do this. I believe in you. Absolutely. Our mudkip of the show, Nadia says reorient she is going to reorient her productivity systems because they fall into the side due to a variety of big things all happening at once. Oh, yes, this will be really helpful. I'm sure I can't wait to hear how it goes. Our panda of the show, James says next connection, don't overdo things and keep trying to find the right balance in terms of work, play and rest. And I'm going to add in parentheses there. Oh, wait, no, those are koalas that eat bamboo. No, those are pandas that eat bamboo. OK, and bamboo. Blue Dragon, our blue dragon of the show, Sky says, find some time to reorient and think about my priorities instead of just trying to get past the tasks on my list every day. Lots of reorientation. I'm really proud of all of us. Our Oracle of the show, Soph says I need to make myself take days off. I've been overdoing it either a day off in the week or not working at weekends at all. So it sounds like my plan for a four day weekend sounds like a great idea here. And also, yes, tune into the after show where Jay has to go through his list of things that he wanted to talk about but didn't have time during the show because it's a systems check show. The name list of the show, Robert says, fix my sleeping habits. The best worst thing about work from home is I can roll into work right as it begins. But I want to make a good habit of making myself wake up at the time I would need to if I needed to commute. This would let me make food or do chores allowing me to make the most of the day. Also wants to make it to the next superconductors co-working session and finally start reading the copy of Dune checked out of the library. You can do it. I love the idea of getting up at the time that you would need to to commute to still do your morning goals. Amazing. Can't wait. And our train enthusiast of the show, Railsie says, complete the custom journal and again, see how I want to document my existence. Might I suggest start out with a little David Attenborough and then move into Dame Judi Dench. Oh, I like that. Yeah. And then and then just finish it off with a little. What's what's his name? The Tonight Show David Letterman. Oh, nice.
