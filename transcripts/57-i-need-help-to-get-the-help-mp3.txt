From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show where we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit, the show that when we're not traveling all over the world, we're sitting at home. This episode is brought to you by HelloFresh, I am Jay, and with me is the Globetrotten showstopping, one horned but don't call it nevermind, can't finish that one. Kathy Kim, hi Kathy. Hi, I am here. I am definitely awake, 100% valid and acceptable. That's OK. Kathy's been all over the world and back. If you want to know more about that and also a little bit deeper dive into the topic that we're talking about this week, then you got to listen to the pre-show. And the only way to do that is to become a member at I'm a superconductor dot com. But you'll also get access to the Discord. Kathy, what happened this week in the Discord? The Discord is popping off. It is St. Jude season, which means everyone is laughing, joking, finding incredible ideas and plans and things to raise money for St. Jude. Being able to go in and make your own fundraiser. We'll talk a little bit about that in a bit. But so many fundraisers are already hitting their goal and being able to just like knock it out of the park. It's incredible. It's so much fun. And speaking of that, we members also get access to, well, I guess, special superconductor members get access to our co-working session where we did stuff and we talked about things specifically St. Jude things, specifically what conduit is going to be doing. For St. Jude. So, yeah, let's let's jump into that. But before we do, if any of that sounds like fun, hanging out with us, doing co-working stuff, hanging out in the Discord, being super excited about St. Jude stuff, become a member today at I'm a superconductor dot com. Personal thought about this. Become a member after you make a donation to St. Jude. We will be perfectly fine if you choose to donate to St. Jude instead of donating to our pockets this month. But if you want to donate to both, I'm not going to stop you. Kathy, what is our shout out? Yeah, our shout out goes to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. And once again, for the fifth year in a row, the Relay FM community is coming together to support St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. St. Jude won't stop their life saving work until no child dies from cancer. With your support, we'll be one step closer to that day. One cure closer, one child closer. Around the world, an estimated 400,000 children are diagnosed with cancer each year. And even more tragically, in many low and middle income countries, four out of five will not survive, largely due to the lack of access to quality care. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and all of us at Relay FM switch on, want to change that. Curing childhood cancer is a tremendous undertaking. And St. Jude needs our help. The generosity of donors everywhere supports cutting edge research that saves lives and ensures that families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital won't stop until no child dies from cancer, no matter where they live. But they can't do it without your help. We are so incredibly grateful for the generosity of our community over the last five years. And we would love your support again this year to support the life saving mission of St. Jude with your help again this year. We know we can surpass two point five million dollars raised. Help us get there. Donors who make an individual gift of sixty dollars or more will receive a digital bundle of Relay FM, wallpapers and screensavers. Last year, our screensavers sent shockwaves through the Relay FM switch on community. So don't miss out. Also, donors who make an individual gift of one hundred dollars or more will receive our twenty twenty three sticker pack featuring all new designs. When you donate this year, please click the blue search employer button on the donation summary page to check if your employer offers a matching gift program. If they do, you'll get an email with details on how to have their match credited to our campaign total. And if you want to get more hands on, you can start your own fundraising campaign to help us reach our goals while earning exclusive Relay FM switch on merch. Fundraisers who raise at least one dollar will receive a twenty twenty three face off edition of the Relay FM switch on for St. Jude Challenge coin. And fundraisers raising two hundred fifty dollars or more will also receive this year's incredible desk mat. And new for this year, the top 50 fundraisers at the end of the campaign will receive a limited edition Relay FM switch on for St. Jude tote bag in an all weather material with laptop sleeve that may have a surprise inside. So please go to St. Jude dot org slash relay to donate and find out more about fundraising. That's St. Jude dot org slash relay to learn more and donate St. Jude won't stop until no child dies from cancer. With your support, we'll be one step closer to that day. One cure closer, one child closer this month and every month. Let's cure childhood cancer together. So last year, Conduit got to have a special part of this by doing what we call a little co-working stream. Kathy, do you know about co-working streams? Um, maybe it sounds really familiar. I don't know. It's been a long week. Yeah. So co-working that that whole thing went so well. People loved it. People were like, we should do more of these. And now we do. This actually was the predecessor to one of our little special superconductor perks. This year, we're not doing a co-working. Well, we are doing co-working streams, but you normally get those. This year, we're gaming because what says productivity than taking a nice little two hour break and forcing Kathy to play one of the potential game of the years, which is Baldur's Gate 3. Kathy, how much do you know about Baldur's Gate 3? Listen, I know it's a game. I know it exists. It is the one that my husband has been playing. It's kind of a D&D option of sorts of something. I don't I don't know. I've never played it. But you have played D&D. Yes, I currently I play a lot of D&D. If you would like to listen to me play D&D, you can go over to the incomparable.com slash TPK, where I partake in some D&Ding for a podcast, because that is the only way that I can actually play D&D is for entertainment of others. So if you want to Kathy to combine one of her greatest passions, playing D&D with one of her greatest enemies, which is playing video games in general, please go to video games in general, playing games that Jay recommends. Yes, exactly. If you want both torture and fun on Kathy's behalf, then go to St. Jude dot org slash relay to donate and find out more about fundraising. That's St. Jude dot org slash relay to learn more and donate. St. Jude won't stop until no diet. No, wow, Kathy, you just finish it. You got this. St. Jude won't stop until no child dies from cancer. With your support, we'll be one step closer to that day. One cure closer, one child closer this month and every month. Let's cure childhood cancer together. And now it is time for the connection check. Zap. Is that how they say it in Prague? Sure. I don't know. I didn't ask anyone yet. Kathy, did you figure out a refreshed system? Oh, goodness. OK, so I gave myself a yellow orange circle thing because no, I did not figure it out, but I have a couple steps in place. And the being gone for a week really threw me off and made me realize just how much I need to do something different, because there were many things that I forgot to do when I came back. And so obviously, something's broken. We need to do this again. So I'm giving myself a little bit, because even though it didn't get figured out, I have started the journey towards it. And so that's better. What about you, Jay? Um, so I wanted an excuse, not that I really needed one, to to play with my little two month planner sampler, and I used the like one of the spreads that I think is the default for like the Hobonichi timeless thing. I kind of like it. I know Kathy is is team Hobonichi. I might be joining that team, especially since the 2024 calendar lineup just got dropped. So, yeah, did. Oh, I saw those photos. I was like, that's that's a lot of people in some of those stores. I'm still not ready for that. But yeah, I might be ordering now that that particular like segment of the planner is full because they only give you two weeks of each one. Yeah, I'm going to keep trying them. But yeah, I totally used it. I use it for all two weeks. I actually really liked it. I like doing the hour by hour thing. I have some complaints, but none that are so important that I would be willing to like I wouldn't be willing to to give this a shot in the future. Yeah, that's good. What about our conductors? Yeah, our conductors are doing incredible things. Our pathologist of the show, Laura, says connection check. Greenheart did a pretty good job of being kind to myself and balancing some busy work days and a kid off of school. Plus a Labor Day trip out of town. Yeah, just a little bit busy, but sounds amazing. Great job. And our Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erica says connection check recycling did not. Not only did she contact a cleaning company, the owner is coming for a walk through this afternoon with a deep clean scheduled for Friday. There you go. I love it. I need to I need to get our stuff deep cleaned. We just got our never mind. We'll talk about that later. Distractions. Yeah, it's OK. I was going to speaking of just distractions. I don't know what you did with so stand at the bottom. So I'm going to ignore that and come back to our soprano of the show. Devo says connection check. Greenheart patched and painted the wall where the electricians had to cut into it. As a bonus, I also did some touch up paint on the porch railing. Look at that double green hearts nailed it. And our shark of the show. One pair of shoes says my connection was from a long, long time ago. That's OK. Welcome back. Was to get the office cleaned up. I managed to get it done a few times. Nice. So way to go, way to go, way to go, way to go, way to go and way to go. Tire advocate of the show, Chinta's who we have missed so much connection check green circle. I took some proper time off of work for vacation with the family and it was glorious. Absolutely glorious. Well done. And our Jay, who is trying to do two things at once and kind of can't. So we'll just say the fish bear of the show, fish, a guy says connection check. Sadly, no, Fishy Kai. The Lego did not appear, but a yellow Lego piece. Apparently, downtime is when you realize how much stuff you've been letting slide for a while. Vacation was busier than we'd like, but we did get some quality fun and relaxation in. Yeah, this is this is that theory of like sometimes your vacations need to be long enough that you can finally let go and actually enjoy having a vacation because the first few days of vacation is just realizing all of the work that you've been avoiding for so long. Yes. Understand. Absolutely. Our mountain dweller of the show, Logang, the circle. I got some logs moved closer to the house for easier cutting up. Excellent. Well done. And our identical twin of the show, Aeron, says Red Circle haven't worked much on my game in the last two weeks. A little bit of the art done, but my progress is mostly stalled. Trying to remind myself that it's OK not to always be productive on side projects. Totally get that. I haven't worked on any of my side coding projects in like a month, and it's not good. No, it's OK. You've been busy. You freaking moved across the country. I think it's OK. Nameless of the show, Nameless has a yellow daisy. Sadly, I was not a responsible plant parent, and I worry that one of my plants are beyond saving, but I did get my wife's gift, have it wrapped and hidden in an undisclosed location. Listen, I make no judgments about being a plant parent because I am a terrible plant parent. My peace lily is dead. All right. I have a plant that is somehow still alive in a coconut in front of the like above my kitchen sink. But I think I might need to transport it into like transfer it into a bigger pot. And I'm really scared to do that. So I'm just going to let it stay there and hopefully live. Some would say Kathy has no more peace in her house. Oh, gosh. Our panda of the show, James says green checkmark. I've made reasonable amount of progress with two of the three things. I needed to do for my deadlines without stressing myself too much, not admittedly the things that pay the bills, but still, in any case, I did not feel the need to go and live in the aforementioned cave. So I consider this a win. OK. Definitely a win. Rails, the air training enthusiast of the show has a yellow circle, moved all the boxes, but didn't really organize much. Then again, my world got flipped upside down. The joys of being laid off. Yeah. Give yourself some grace. I'm so proud that you gave yourself the yellow circle. That's incredible. You're doing an amazing job. So I wanted to joke about the the flipped upside down thing with taking a minute and just sitting right there and to tell you how you became a principal town called Bel Air. However, with with the layoff thing, I'm really sorry to hear that. And then our oracle of the show, Soph says orange heart. I was. I meant to add a second day of swimming every week. No swimming was added. Life has been challenging. I did keep the swimming going once a week, so that's something. There you go. You're still keeping the habit strong. I love it. So let.

I did HelloFresh when it first came out forever ago and just got so angry because it would say, this will take you 30 minutes. And an hour and a half later, I would finally have dinner on the table. Now it's so much more streamlined and still has this incredible food. In fact, one of the recipes that we got, oh, gosh, I should have prepped. I don't remember which one. I think it was like a chicken, like a Parmesan chicken and Brussels sprouts or something. It was so good that Ryan Mr. Soup was like. I need this again. So thankfully we have the recipe, we have the ability to make it again. I do have to go out and, you know, get the supplies, but I know what supplies to get, I know how much to use, and I can make that dish again. What about you, Jay? I I'm just I'm just going to say, yeah, my wife is out of town this week and there are a lot of things I have to think about now because I have a wee one that I normally share parenting responsibilities over. I wish that I had one less decision to make right now. And that is really what HelloFresh is. I know we use HelloFresh for a long time. Obviously, moving in things, we had to get a lot of stuff reconfigured and things, but just not having to think too hard, just open a bag, start cooking, start making it happen. And then you have a good, like healthy decision, not just the the last minute trip to McDonald's or or insert, you know, greasy food choice here. Yeah, I I'm starting to regret decisions that I've made my past. And if you want to not regret your decisions in the past or in the future, you don't want your future decisions. Yes.

Our thanks to HelloFresh for their support of this show and all of Relay FM. And at the end of every sponsor read, I like to say thank you in a different language. This time, I thought I was going to pick French. Instead, I picked Frisian and I'm going to say, I'm guessing a tongue, because if I say tank, that just feels wrong. So. Hi, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, Kathy, as I. J J J J J J J. I should get used to that, because what I'm going to be hearing for the next week is that except for my child doesn't call me by my name. Yes, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad. Exactly. When's mom coming home? Yes. Oh, my goodness. So outside of those responsibilities, I have hinted or I think I've mentioned a couple of times on the show that I started a new community called the Black Python Developers Community named TBD. It's it's this this community for Python developers who identify as black. That's you know, it's a global community. It's on Discord. And one of the things that I've noticed is there is a desire for so many people to participate and collaborate on projects. And they're all kind of looking at me to be the the primary organizer for all of those projects. They're also they're also looking at me for coming up with all the ideas for those projects. And it's interesting because I I wanted to talk about this kind of in the realm of kind of translating it to having multiple responsibilities and having different demands on you from those responsibilities and kind of what to do about it. But before I talk about what I chose to do, I we know other than being the Discord mom or Discord mod, Discord mod mom, mod mom, this thing. Yeah, mod mod and being like chief unicorn in charge or the the C.U.O. And and also being the business unicorn for so many companies, including Relay FM Switch on. How how do you work with kind of unexpected demands from either clients or communities or maybe even family? Yeah, it's it's definitely rough, especially these last couple of years have made some adjustments on what I can do. And I've had to say no a lot more. For example, I. OK, so my mom broke her foot walking off my porch a couple of weeks ago. My dad had back surgery a few. It's now been like seven weeks, I think, which means they're both a little bit broken, OK, a little bit more broken than than normal. And my trip to Prague also came at the time where we had a significant amount of prep work for Dragon Mount to get into place, because season two of The Wheel of Time premiered last Friday. We were lucky enough to get screeners, which means that we could prep our YouTube videos and podcasts and things before I left, because I knew I would be traveling basically when the show released, which is not great when you are a community leader for around the world that this show is. So managing to get the filming and recording and editing and publishing and all of that done as much as I could before I left. I also had multiple contacts from my parents saying, hey, can you come help us unload the dishwasher? Because they couldn't. They literally could not, which is great. You know, most of the time, I am more than happy to help how we can, especially, you know, I can drop my kit off perfect. However, the tight timelines made it where it was less of a possibility for me to drop everything and come, you know, help with laundry. Additionally, earlier, like several months ago, we played the like hand me down computer game. I updated to a MacBook Pro because my Air wasn't quite hitting what I needed it to do. So I passed on my pro or my Air to my dad. My dad passed on his old MacBook Pro to my kid. The amount of storage on the MacBook Air was not low enough and the computer was not large enough. And he kept having to use like an external hard drive and it was making him angry. So he wanted to switch back to the MacBook Pro. The problem is this computer doesn't get upgraded enough. And I spent many hours trying to transfer the data from a newer computer to the older one. It basically didn't work. So out of nowhere, he's like, fine, I'll just go buy a new one. He just goes, picks it up, drops it off. And it's like, hey, can you get this done? This is like 36 hours before I'm flying, before I'm leaving. And so I am also my my planning is great. We forward, drag them out. We did a live streaming fundraiser where we watched season one all in one like chunk. Marathoned it. And then we raised money for the Maui for Maui and the fires and for the American Red Cross in Maui for victims of the fires. So we did 11 hour stream on Saturday while I'm trying to, you know, make sure like get the computer up and running. And my dad had the audacity that night. So after I had been streaming for 11 hours, he texts me and says, hey, I haven't heard from you. So I'm guessing it's not done yet. And I'm like, oh, yeah, that's correct. I didn't have anyone local enough to where I could delegate it to. I tried having my kid do it, but it was too complicated. And I'm glad so. So I tried having Mini Soup do the exchange for the MacBook Pro to the the old. Like the switch to his old computer. But the problem was is it was too old. And so all of my things that I tried to do, it wasn't working. So there's no way that Mini Soup would have been able to to do that. Additionally. No one else in my family really is a Mac person, and it was complicated enough to get the new one from the old. It was just it was just a nightmare. So I tried to delegate. I try and delegate a variety of different things to people when I can, specifically like my brother is a retired Marine. He had obviously he has things during the day. But I have trained my parents to contact him first when they need things, not physical things because he's disabled. He has some issues as well. But for things like picking somebody up or going to get milk because they need milk, something like that, it doesn't have to be me. And I finally was like, hey, can you call my brother first? Don't call me first, because in the past I was able to drop everything and go if they needed something. And my schedule is such that I just can't do that anymore. And it's really rough. It's really difficult to like have that not saying no necessarily, but like setting expectations. And this year specifically has been a major adjustment to setting those expectations. Yeah. And that's been that was kind of the the big challenge for me was as a new community, you kind of deal with a lot of different things, especially when you're and I mean, again, I don't know how many people understand this position. But when you have a bunch of people who are often ignored and you bring them all into one community, there is this weird vacuum of who's going to talk first. That happens because everyone is so used to like their voice not carrying any weight. So now you're just like, I want somebody to get involved. I want somebody to. Anybody. Yes, exactly. So you you feel bad every time someone's like, what if we do this? And you're like, I can't that. No. Yes. Setting setting those nose, those hard, hard nose, being able to. To set the expectations, not just for others, but for yourselves. And it's there are so many things that like, yes, I could do X, I could do Y. I have like random ideas of like a tick tock series to do for things. This is not what I need to be doing. I should not. I need to shut my brain off. And so I sent the idea to somebody else to have them do it. Because, again, for for community based things, especially, it's important to find those people we currently like sent out for for Dragon Mount. We are hiring a social media manager. It's like a slight light paid volunteer. Like, I wish we could, you know, pay a living wage, but we can't. And so like making sure everyone knows, hey, this is basically volunteering with a slight like money for coffee. Like here you can get a coffee or a drink or something with the monthly money that you get. But we got so many applications that now I'm like, can I delegate to have somebody else make this decision? Right. It's so hard to get the help. I need help to get the help. And it's just like, oh, my gosh, it's exhausting. That's title right there. I need help to get the help because that is the feeling that is 100 percent the feeling. And that was a very interesting point for us of people were like, I want I would love for us to have a logo. And it was like, OK, cool. Here are all of the things. This is this is an all black community. One, we're not going to just throw this into something like stable division or some AI thing and then just go with whatever the first result is. This is a place where a lot of people can gain the skills that they are wanting to gain so that they can get gainful employment. OK, cool. That means we're going to try to find someone from within the community to help design a logo. I don't know how many people have worked with designers, but designing a logo is not as simple as I made a picture. And here you go. Picture done. Usually these things have briefs. They have like an entire document. Like the the conduit logo went through so many like that whole chapter. I think that took like two or three weeks just to get to where like, OK, we have a rough idea of what we want. Here's the prompt. Here's why we went with what we went with. And then we still had to choose and have a back and forth. So it's like almost a full month of working with a designer to come up with a logo. And that was part of launching the show. Like who could not launch show until logo was done, could not launch show until music was figured out. And oh, my gosh, the music was almost worse than the logo because we're just like, I don't I don't know. I don't know what I want. I don't know. And and these little things that people are like, oh, yeah, let's just do this. Like there is no just anything when it comes to any of this. It's next to impossible to just like just do a logo. And if you just do a logo, that's how you get the really depressing like, you know, Comic Sans with an emoji logos that are just depressing. And if you want to be seen as a professional, you need to be able to like see a professional. Exactly. So in the end, here's here's what I did. And I'm going to try to de-nerd this as much as possible to make it useful for people. One of the biggest things that a lot of people were asking about was we want to build a website. OK, cool. So the first thing that I did was I created a an account, a group account for our developer collective type thing and then said, we need a website. Here are the decisions that need to be made in doing the website. The very first thing is we need a point person, a person who's going to take ownership of this project and ensure that all of these things get done before we go live with it. We need a project manager. And in many cases, who wants to be that? I will not be that person. Nothing will get done until this person has been appointed. And then I will meet with that person and we will talk about all the things that we want to do. And we will talk about all the steps in which it will take to create this website. And then at that point, I will pass all decision making power onto that person. Yeah, we are still looking for that person today. So this this was the the eye opener. And I think that ultimately that's that's what you need. I thought about this in the in the term of like LASIK surgery or like PRK like that process. You have to have someone's eye like physically manipulated to stay open, because if they blink, bad things happen. This is what we need. We needed like here are all the steps. I am not doing them. I am not going to be responsible for making sure that they get done. If somebody wants them done, they will need to take charge and they will be responsible in reporting to me as to the things that get done. If not, we don't have a website. It's twenty twenty three. You don't really need a website for everything that you do. But if you want one like, first of all, talk to one of our previous sponsors and use our promo code if they still work. But then if if they don't, then we are perfectly fine operating as we currently are. And and this, I think, kind of set the tone for folks. They're like, oh, oh, that is a lot more work than I thought. Yeah, there's there's something to be said about being able to not just set expectations, but make explanations on why it's not just making a logo. Like, here's the thing is most people in the world that don't do something like this professionally have no idea what it takes to do things. Things that they do, like, for example, a logo, you have to know who is the logo for, who is your target market, what sort of colors do you like? You can't you should not necessarily just go, I like the color purple. Let's do the logo purple. Like, yes, you can. Is that going to be the best option? Probably not. And being able to have somebody who knows what they're talking about, to be able to explain the steps that go into it means that you can set expectations a little bit different. However, you still need somebody to do that. And having it be something that works for a volunteer, for a community, that sort of thing is is difficult. And there's a reason that it hasn't existed. And I love how you mentioned like you're hiring someone for like a coffee tier type budget, because that is something that we have talked about. And someone was like, hey, will I be compensated for making the logo? And it was like, look, I am not the type of person that wants to tell you that, you know, you're doing this for exposure. But what I can tell you is I have already invested hundreds of dollars into this community and I am not being compensated for that money. So while I am OK with paying you, I have to let you understand that the budget that we have is very, very shoe straight. So don't. And it's it's it's one thing to be like, oh, yes, explain. Like, it's one thing to to switch it and be like, ha ha. Yes, of course, you will be compensated. And then, oh, by the way, here's twenty dollars type of a thing. It's so important. Once again, communication is key. It is important to communicate all of those steps and let somebody make those those choices. The number of people I was hoping that by saying, hey, by the way, this is how much you get would like limit the number of applicants. But it didn't. So I still have like I have done two rounds now of like hiring. And I still have like. Eleven or twelve people that I'm going to like need to get to the next step. And I'm just like, how am I going to choose somebody? Because I also can't I can't hire them all. But they think you can. No, they don't. They know. But I might like my my thought process is anyone that doesn't get officially hired. I still am more than happy to have them on the team as volunteers and then possibly in the future, be able to like financially compensate, because that's the other nice thing about this community. The Wheel of Time community, everyone is extremely passionate about what they're doing. And there's a wide variety of people that are doing a lot of this stuff for themselves, not being paid already. And so they're like, I'm already doing this. Why not do it for one of the oldest communities, too? So, yeah. And I do think that there is something to say about it. It is an honor that so many people would would put trust in me to to run this. I had a friend that I was hoping would help me with this. And what they've kind of said is this is your vision. And there are a lot of people that are looking to you to to steer this ship. It's important for you to build a crew, but understand that you are you are the captain now. So like sounds just as threatening. So you have to that there is there is some level of of work that is going to be expected of you. But every every leader that I know of, every leader that has, you know, at least from my military, which I did not know that your brother was a retired Marine. I have so many questions now that we can talk about later. One Marine to another, one Marine to another will tell you that the captain, the commander, the general, they don't they are equally as important as the people on the ground making the decisions and doing the things. But they are not making every decision and doing all the things. And they have to have trust in the people that they are delegating and appointing to do those other things. And I think that that's yes, that's the biggest challenge you get. You see these these, you know, people with a bunch of shiny stuff on their on their chests and collars. And then you're like, wow, they must have done a lot. They did all the things. And like really what they did was they put trust in the right people to make really hard decisions. And then the decisions that those people couldn't make. That's when they stood in and and did the things that only they could do. Yes. And you can't do those things when you are preoccupied with the other stuff. Yes. And that's something we I have this conversation with a lot with the our unicorn clients when they come to us and have that first initial conversation. It's really intimidating and scary to hand over a portion of your business, of your money making, you know, your your baby to somebody else. And that level of trust, especially with people that you don't know, with people that you haven't met before and figuring out how it works and what to do. And having to to work through that journey with everybody is really it's emotionally exhausting. And you have it takes time to to get through that process. And sometimes it doesn't work. And that's OK, too. Any time I have my initial onboarding client conversations, I'm like, hey, this it's OK if this doesn't work out. Like, we want you to communicate with us if you're frustrated with something, if, you know, it's not vibing, if it's not working, because it's not. I don't want you to be somewhere that you're not happy and we need to help you the way that we can. And if there isn't that level of trust, if we're not vibing, then it doesn't matter. You can't it's not going to work. And so it's important to be able to sit and and recognize your limitations, but also recognize that other people can be trusted to get this done, whatever it is that needs to be done. And you might make a mistake. And that's OK, too, because you learned. And if you are that person that's wanting the opportunity to show that you can you can handle it like, oh, man, if you just tell that person that, I'm sure they will be like, yes. Let me let me give you this work right now. There's definitely something that I can pass your way. And if they are the kind of person that wants to do all of it themselves, that's OK. There will be someone else in that role soon enough. So. So, yeah, I this this helped me out a lot. Even sometimes I think that like the biggest part of the show is feeling as if I'm not alone in things. That is such a big thing where I often am like, I can't be the only person that's having to deal with this particular thing. And then Kathy jumps in and goes, duh, you're not right. But it doesn't you may know, you know this in your head, you know that you're not the only one. And yet these brains, they be lying and they don't know how to like really explain that. Yes, I don't know what I'm talking about. And coming in and just don't listen to the brain bees, but find a community, find people that can help remind you that you are not alone and that what you are going through is completely normal, completely acceptable, completely like exactly how stuff happens. And that's great and perfect and amazing. And you are like doing a great job. And brains do be lying, though, but you know, it doesn't lie us to our future selves. We set these connections. Kathy, what are you going to say? As a segue, look at that segue. I am going to finalize my system. I love it again. Is there anything that you think you can do this time differently to help? Yeah, I think. By actually being home, I will have more space in my brain to kind of like do these things. And so. Because my schedule is such that I'm not completely ruining my daily, I can. I can better figure out what my system, what my process, what my days will be so that I can actually finalize this system. I love that. What about you? Well, I hinted earlier that it's it's me and the we one this week, and I am going to try to make the most of that. I am getting ready to travel a lot for the next few months. And I know how hard that is on my daughter. And we don't get a lot of time to just hang out and to be silly and to kind of be buddies, even though, like, yeah, that kid is one of my best friends. So I feel like I have to be more disciplinary when I'm it's like work, go, go downstairs, be parent. Now, I really do want to still work, still go home and be parent, but. Take more time to. Just spend with her specifically and not like spend with her with a laptop doing doing other work. Yeah. Concentrating and being fully present. Yeah. So I'm I'm not going to be perfect at this. So I'm going to tell myself that I want to take two evenings to spend just with her. No work, no other stuff. Doing something that she enjoys, which probably means that there will be many a Barbie's birthday party in this house. What about some of our conductors? What are they? What do they got planned? Yeah, our conductors have some awesome things coming on. Our pathologist of the show, Laura says, New Connection should have a pretty normal week this week. I'd love to be able to pick a system and stick to it for two weeks. Don't jump between two notebooks and three apps day to day. I should be able to do that, right? You and me, my girl, you and me, Laura, we can do this together. Laura, might I recommend this Yoseka Labs two week planner because it forces you to stick to one thing, but only for two weeks. And then after that, you have to stick to a different thing or you just choose not to. And then you know what you want to do. I can't talk enough about these things are amazing. The Canadian trivia card enthusiast of the show, Erika, says New Connection do self reflection and self care. Yes, with the guilt and class shame of hiring someone to clean and breathe through the anxiety of having strangers in a home safe space. Mutual friend enthusiastically made this connection, so it'll be fine. Just need to convince the old nervous system not to freak out. I hope that you can quickly get past that and then look at the cleanliness of your home and safe space and use that to convince you in the future to continue letting that person in. Yes, it's so hard, but I'm so proud of you. You are doing great. Our soprano of the show, Devo says Next Connection, start working on a knit scarf that will be my mom's Christmas present. Yes. Get that ready. Good job. Our shark of the show, One Pair of Shoes says my connection for the next fortnight or conduit, as we call them, is to get six research projects completed and filed. It'll be a grind, but I can do it. That number, I don't even know what goes into doing that. But if you think you can do it, you can do it. Definitely. Our entire advocate of the show, Chief says Next Connection, I want to say it. I want to say to completely clear out and tidy my home office, but realistically, I'm going to aim for at least the desk area being clear and easily usable. This is a great example of what these connections are for. You want to make sure that you can have something that you can do, that you can actually manage it. And we believe in you that you can do so. And clearly, so do you. And then our mountain, wait, no, fish bear of the show says, finish at least two house projects. That was fishekai that may have stalled over the summer. Yeah, I OK. You know, you know what needs to go into finishing them. So I I definitely wish you the best of luck in getting those done. You just made me look at my own house and all of the projects that are involved. And I was like, two, you want to finish two? But my projects are not your projects, so you can do it. Yeah. Our mountain dweller of the show, Logang, Next Connection. Next weekend. Next weekend, I'm solo dadding with a toddler, a puppy, a dog and two cats. So survive and then get some me time when my wife is back. I think that sounds fantastic. And I wish you all the best. I personally think that Logang is just the like parallel universe of me because like bought a house, bought a house, wife's away. So I'm solo daddy. Wife's away next weekend. So I'm solo daddy. Two dogs are a dog and two cats. I've got two dogs and a cat. So it's like, oh, they got two dogs and two cats. So it's like, oh, I I can't wait for Logang to go to London to catch us at the live event, which we are not confirming we will be at. But we're going to try. I know Mike's doing his whole new new a new podcaster approaches. I can't in clear conscience confirm that that hard that I will be there. But yeah, I can't wait to be there. I can't wait to meet Logang in person and just be like, do the Spider-Man meme of just like, it's you. Yeah. Yes. So if you need to get a cape, absolutely capes, capes all around. Anyone that comes to the show with a cape will get a special present. So just keep that in mind. You have a while. It's time to go. Yeah. So many people. Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited. But we can't can't think of that yet. We got to finish this episode. Our identical twin of the show, Aaron, says new connection fully implement a new enemy type with animations and custom attributes. I know what all of those world words mean, and I'm pretty sure I know what they mean together. But. I can't wait to see what you do. Might I suggest you make a conductor or a superconductor? Nice. Nice. And our nameless of the show, Nameless, says pack and be ready for my anniversary trip. So many trips. So many things. So many happenings. I love it. Our panda of the show, James connection. Oh. New connection. Survive the Apple announcements and submit all my app updates. And more importantly, survive being home alone for two weeks while looking after myself during that time. I believe in you, James, especially since I am home so I can bug you to hydrate and go to bed. Just remember to play the video that says Merry Christmas, you filthy animal with the machine gun fire afterwards. If someone tries to sneak in. And then our train enthusiast of the show, Relsie, says new connection applying for jobs, maybe organize things again. Like I said last time, it's OK. It's OK. Run it back. I love it. Yes. Our oracle of the show. So says I'm working on a big research report and need to get it finished, hoping for lots of focus till it's done. Yes, you can do it.
