From Relay FM, you're listening to Conduit, the show we condue our own thing with our own productivity systems. Welcome to Conduit. I'm Jay. And I'm Kathy. And this is surreal. This is so amazing. I am so glad that we are starting and I'm excited for the topic that we're bringing for our first episode. Oh yes, me too. Yes. But before we do that, Kathy, I think we have some connections that we got to check. Absolutely. But Jay, what are connections? So we explained a little bit our connections in episode zero. And if you haven't yet, that is available. You should go listen to that. Especially if you're listening to one, because we all know that zero comes before one. So pause this, listen to episode zero. Okay, welcome back. Thank you. It's only 10 minutes. It's very short. It's only 10 minutes. Yeah. I'm glad that you were able to survive all 10 of those. But in case you decided to skip along anyway, the connections are how we're going to make that we are growing in our productivity from each episode. We're going to give ourselves a few challenges for the in-between time, because sadly we can't just spend all day recording and all week recording because that would be a really long show. Wow. I don't think anyone ever would listen to it, but it's an interesting idea. We should look into that maybe for the future. Never. I would get in so much trouble. Like, hey, honey, I'm sorry. I'm going to have to record for the next seven days. Here we go. We do a Twitch. We just started Twitch channel where you hang out. We get one of the fancy little hats with the cameras on it, just like a reality show. This is something we should pitch. Let's put this together for the future, but not right now. This is not what the show is now. Yeah. So at the end of episode zero, we gave ourselves a couple of connections that we wanted to be accountable for. Kathy, what was your connection? My connection was to put out a show. I mean, I think you did that. I think I did too. I did. And it went surprisingly flawless. Here's a little peek behind the curtain. We did episode zero not just to do an introduction to the show, but also to set up the feed. And another little hint. This was the first show that really started with Apple podcasts as opposed to iTunes. And we didn't really know how it would go. It went really well. I mean, I guess since you took my connection, I had to come up with another one. My connection was to share it with the audience. And I will say that people were very, very enthusiastic. And I was too. I didn't know what to expect when we announced that, hey, we're doing a show and here is the show and the show is the show. People lost their ever-loving minds in the best way possible. I got so many warm welcomes and people excited to listen. But with that being said, I guess we should give the people what they want and move on to our first topic. Yes, I'm very excited. And not just because we talked about this before, but I'm ready to officially do it in the conduit way. Absolutely. So for this first episode, we wanted to let people get an idea of how we productivity. You know, what is productivity to Kathy and Jay? And of course, we're special and we don't do anything easily or in any kind of way that would be identified as boring. We decided to give our productivity their own systems and names. So, Kathy, what's your productivity system? My productivity system name is a very unique. Nobody would ever guess this for me because my Internet brand is not obvious in any sense of the word. But I call this the Unicorn Method. The Unicorn Method. Does that mean it like everywhere you go when you complete a task, you just throw glitter on it and you're like, done? I thought about that. However, with my mechanical keyboard, I feel like that would probably be counterintuitive to productivity if I was to get glitter inside my keyboard. Instead, I kind of just think of it as imaginary confetti and a little sparkle sound that gets thrown in every time I check off something on my list. All confetti is magical. Mike, please don't kick us off the network for destroying keyboards. Yeah, please don't. It's great. It's great. So my system is unique in the sense that what I do and how I do it is also very unique. So in my free time, well, in my real life, when I am not podcasting or parenting or caregiving or any of that, I am the unicorn sidekick. And what that means is I am lucky enough to help businesses kind of get their stuff together. So that looks like everything from managing emails, helping with particular projects, working with client onboarding or client communications, configuring websites, setting up product listings, basically coming in and helping support small businesses in ways that they need. A lot of times my clients are people that either started their business by themselves or maybe with a partner or two, and they are completely overwhelmed with certain pieces of it. So they maybe had never worked on creating any sort of onboarding processes and need to come in and like, how do I manage all of my clients? How do I do any of this? And so I'm lucky enough to come in and kind of help support the person that is doing their dream job that has created their dream business and let them concentrate on the part that gives them passion and makes them happy and joyful and not the parts that maybe are less exciting or that they don't like doing. And what this means is I'm coming into multiple different businesses and being able to support them in the way and format that they need it. And so I use pretty much every single system program under the sun because I don't want to come in and say, hi, I know you have a PC, but you need to get a Mac, please, so that I can use OmniFocus. OK, thanks. Bye. That doesn't work for me. That doesn't work for how my clients need me. So I work with them if they don't have anything that they use currently. I work with them to try and figure out what the best task management software or productivity system is for them. And in the process of that, I have also become very confident. Oh, wow, that was. She says with such confidence. Confident pause. I'm very familiar and confident with how I do my day, even though it uses a variety of other things from my clients, if that makes sense. So I use a hybrid system, both digital and physical analog. That's a good word, analog, to track what I need to do for the day. I have repeating tasks and items in Todoist. I use Todoist because it works with my quote unquote mini unicorns. I have a unicorn agency, so I have a variety of other unicorns that help other businesses that I'm really lucky that I get to work. And so we use Todoist to help farm that out to a variety of different people. It's quick, easy, works great for me. And then I utilize that, my calendar and all of the other Todoist objects. And each day I sit down at my Hobonichi cousin and write my Todoist check boxes. Very similar to a bullet journal style, but without all of the extra things involved in that whole system. And it works for me. I like the process of manually writing down what I need to do for the day, because it helps me really concentrate on what's going on in that day without getting overwhelmed by the 300 steps of the projects for all of the clients that I'm working with. I wanted to nerd out so much and say, well, as a productivity enthusiast, I love that your system allows for maximum flexibility, being able to integrate with what other people are already doing. Because I think I even put this in one of the tweets that I sent out about the show, was like, we want to celebrate people doing what they're doing, because they usually know, like, yeah, there's a reason I chose the software. And if I don't know, being able to work along with them in that space as well, but not just for the people that you, I don't want to say work for, but the people that hire you, but the people that you work with, your other unicorns in your, is it a herd? Yes, my unicorn herd. Yeah, I love that it's a herd of unicorns. I have this picture of like in the mountains somewhere, there's a bunch of people with laptops just running as fast as possible. We're very majestic. Stay tuned for a future gift that we will create, you know, when we finally get to have a retreat. Oh, that sounds amazing. But yeah, like you're able to provide a source of truth for yourself that is the most flexible tool possible, pen and paper. But you're also able to take the high level view, put that there, and then all of the like nitty gritty details that, you know, client A has versus client B and, you know, unicorn C and insert next thing just for completion D, all the above can, like they all have their own things and your system can inherit that and it can work with all of those things and not drive you completely up the wall like it would me. Right. And I feel like even though I am like someone would look at my system and say, oh my gosh, you're double entry because you have the stuff in the digital form and you're placing it into the analog like format. But for my brain, that doesn't feel like it's double entry because it was entered not today. Whereas if I was to like copy and paste it into, you know, one true system to make sure that I'm tracking things like that gets really complicated and notifications get overwhelming and if things can get lost in that in that crossover. But because I'm pulling things just once a day, every day into like my daily sheet, it doesn't ever feel like it's too much manual work, which is a benefit for me because I like to be efficient slash lazy and I don't want to do double work, but it doesn't feel like double work and it works for me. So that's great. So what is it about the particular tools that you make home? I know you mentioned Todoist gives you that ability to kind of be compatible with all of the other unicorns, but like your Hobonichi, like what is it that makes the Hobonichi all it is in its glory and wonder? Part of it is familiarity. I've been using a Hobonichi in one form or another since 2015. And we'll attach a picture in the show notes of my quote unquote collection. Please try not to cry at the upside down backwards year for 2020. It kind of fits with the theme of everything. But I love the paper. I love the feel. I love the cover that I have on it, which is a green leather cover with a title imprinted on it for one star leather that I cannot say on this network. But F important S is on the cover and it makes me happy every time I see it. It has enough space because it's an A5 size, which is just the right amount of filler information. So it has on one side and these are on the daily spreads. I have used like the monthly and weekly spreads in the past, but I don't really do it anymore. So just on the daily spreads, it has the date, the day of the week, the moon location thing. And then it has like a timeline, a little timeline in, I don't know, the top quarter, top left quarter of the page. And then it has the rest of the pages available to like make check boxes or notes or smears or whatever needs to go in that page. And it feels the perfect size, the perfect organization so that I can make the page be what I need it to be for me without completely stressing about making sure that it's correct or that I'm, oh, I didn't use this page so clearly I wasted the notebook. I do sometimes wish that it had like a spiral bound or something so it wouldn't take up as much space on my desk, but it just kind of hangs out wide open. My fountain pen lives in the middle of the pages and it's there to write and take notes however I need. So I know that I'm not interviewing you or anything, but I just have so many questions. It's fine. It'll be your turn later. So, okay, perfect deal. So I guess the last question that I have is, do you feel like what you write in your notebook drives your day or is it the culmination of like all the other things that are yelling at you from everyone else's systems? Is that driving what goes in the notebook or does the notebook be like the center of peace and calm and then you kind of work your way outward? Yeah, the notebook kind of is that center of my day. So there's always certain things that I have to do. I manage one of my clients emails so I'm like in that email box every day. I know that that's something that I have to do. I don't need to write it in my planner because it's something that's constantly present, but if there's a project for that client or a very specific, I don't know, some sort of research thing that I need to do for them, I'll put that in my planner or if there's something that I know that I haven't gotten to in the past, I will put that in the planner. I could have a checkbox in my planner that says email check one, email check two, email check three, but that's redundant because it's something that I know I have to do anyways. So even though my planner is kind of that centered peace moment, I don't actually end up putting everything specifically in there or all of the specific steps that are involved for it either. Does that make sense? It does and I love that you have a, I don't want to say like a sacred garden. I'm going to, we're going to have to, it's only episode one and I'm already like trying to find people to bring onto the show, but I had a wonderful conversation with an amazing lady named Brittany Baxston who referred to her bullet journal as a garden that she tends instead of like, in my case, it's like a bunch of fires that I have to put out. Well, and I love that you treat your notebook as kind of the source of the center of happiness and control in what I would consider to be one of the most chaotic jobs, like where you have everyone else's problems to deal with. It's like, no, I'm here in my peaceful garden and I only allow the things that I allow into my garden and everything else is just work and it's fine. Yes. Yes. I love that, especially because everything that I choose in my planner, every part of it makes me happy and brings me joy. So the specific fountain pens that I use and the inks that I use and I have little tabs for each of the months, even though I never really like utilize them, but they make me happy just to see. And if you've ever seen my office, every piece of it brings me joy and happiness. And that's so important to me that I have that as a part of my life and my work and everything that I do so that I can try and not shine that happiness elsewhere because I realize that life can be difficult and there can be some bad things that happen and that's okay too. But to really embrace the little bits of joy and happiness that I can. Absolutely. I love it. It's productivity talk. I know it's so great. And now it's your turn. Now that I've talked for a good 15, 20 minutes about my stuff, I would love to know, Jay, what your system is and why you love it so much. So originally, I know we've, again, I don't want to spoil things for so many people that think that this is like the second time we've ever had a conversation, but we, when we first did this, I had not heard this song yet, but now I have heard a song that is like absolutely perfect to define my system. So I'm going to call my system the silk sonic method. And it is all based on the first lines of leave the door open, which is what you doing? Where are you at? You got plans. Don't say that. That is very much my entire flow of everything. I originally called my system the what you did checklist method. So if people want to know what it was originally called, it's that now it's the silk sonic method because that just sounds better. But I, I'm a developer advocate. I work for a technology company. We have a software product and it is my job to be engaged in the community and talking to people in that community, not necessarily about our product, just about all the things. But what that tends to mean is things can get hairy quickly. It could, it could be, you know, one day I have one meeting and I'm working on a blog post or a video or a conference talk or a podcast. And then the next, I have six meetings and two presentations and I have to submit a report or come up with a plan. And I have these initiatives that I'm responsible for. So there's just so much going on. And the thing that I believe gives my system the most value is that at any moment in time, I can pick something up and set something down and it might be set down or picked up for a day, an hour, or it might be two or three months from now. So the way that that works for me is every day, my garden is the list of things that I have completed, things that I have done. What did happen that day? Again, like what you doing? What meetings did I attend? What projects did I work on? And from there, I start to get an idea of what comes next. Okay, I got a bunch of emails about this diversity project that I'm working on or I'm working on closing a deal with an organization for partnership. And in order to do that, I now have 15 new tasks that I have to choose what I'm going to do and what I'm going to delegate. And in order to do that, I just have to know where the stuff is. I don't have to have it all tucked away in my library. And like you said, I use a notebook too and my notebook is my garden and I don't put other people's plants in my garden because that's called theft. I don't want to do that. So what I tend to do is I use a bunch of different tools to highlight what my obligations are to any given project, any given task, and then I also link to where that information lives. The company I work for, we use monday.com for a lot of our project planning. So in most cases, it'll be there. If it's something that I'm in charge of for a long period of time, I will use a tool like craft. That's the tool I'm using right now that can always change. And then I also keep a lot of checklists. And the reason being is even though I'm doing a lot of these things, they tend to have a similar cadence. So hey, if you're working with an organization, the organization might do things a certain way, but ultimately, the processes will always be the same. It's step one, we send out an inquiry. Step two, we do this. And then step three, we do this. And then finally, step four, we send a check or we get a check or something happens. So for me, I have to know what the steps are, so that I can often give that feedback of where I am and what comes next. You have a very similar mindset to me. Your life is also very chaotic. And your projects are also like very, there's lots of them. You're not just working on one thing. And for a lot of people, that could be really overwhelming if you are used to only working on one thing at a time. We're both kind of embracing our lives how they are, and not trying to necessarily change our lives, but figure out the best way to let it work for us. And I especially really love the name change. And now every time I think of you, I will be having that TikTok in my head, because of course, it's popular on TikTok. And that's where I know it from, not the actual song, but the TikToks that are related to it. And it makes me very happy. I think one of the things that we both kind of talked about is the idea of making sure the people that we're responsible to know what's going on. As I mentioned for me, it's like monday.com, but that even goes for my family. My wife and I have a giant wall calendar brought to you by the fine people at Focus, also a part of the lovely Relay FM family, Relay FM, Switch On. But that is how our family runs, is that giant wall calendar. And it's not that we're not militant about it. I could be working at six in the morning like I was last weekend, or I could be having to attend a virtual user group that's based out of Australia. And for that means, I'm working until 11 o'clock at night, and I am also a husband and a father. So I need to make sure that I relay that information. Switch on. Sorry. Yes, Relay, switch on. That I relay that information to my spouse so that we can plan and we can work around each other because she has her own things that she wants to do and that she has to do that involve work and life and the balance that we try to put in there somewhere. But all of those individual things, while they may not be 100% my task or my responsibility or my ownership, it's good to voice that information. And a good example of that is this week. This has been such an amazing week. We launched a podcast. There's a lot that goes into that. There's going to be other podcast interviews and marketing stuff because in my job, I play the role of a marketer too sometimes. So doing all of those things, I have to let the people around me know, hey, I'm not available for this meeting at this time because I'm recording a podcast or I can't take out the trash because I'm going to forget because I have ADHD and that just can happen sometimes. So if the trash isn't out by this time, this hour, this day, then can you please just do that for me and then I'll apologize profusely and then it'll be okay. But at least we know that the trash made it out that week. And I think that there's a lot of balance that comes with that, but a lot of collaboration that doesn't make it into task managers. Well, and sometimes in my case, it does because if it's that important, I do need to write it down. Yeah, a lot of the personal things around the house are things that live in my calendar so that it can remind me. So every Sunday, we have to put the trash out. And so I have a thing at six o'clock that says, hey, put the trash out. And if I've forgotten or because normally I'll do it sometime earlier in the day, but if I haven't, it's like, oh yeah, it's Sunday, I need to do that. My situation is a little bit different because both my child is older, they're 12 years old, and then my husband doesn't work. He's disabled, so there's a lot of extra management and level on that. I try to talk to him every night about what the plan is for the next day, but I'm not very good at that, doing it every single day. And I really should get better, but I'm thinking that maybe I need to get a wall calendar instead and keep that up so that he knows when I'm recording a podcast, he knows when Avi has dance class, he knows when I'm going to be gone all day on a film set because I'm an extra and randomly do this, or if we're going to the beach to visit friends, being able to check in on himself for what's going on, especially if I have failed to transmit that information could be really helpful. So I think that might be something that lives in my mind. And if you're listening to this, can I recommend a wall calendar for next year? The folks at Focus have a great one, but there's also really fun Mac and Apple related hardware calendar that I believe the Kickstarter is still going on. So if you want to support our very own Stephen Hackett, we'll have a link to the Kickstarter down below where you can get your very own special photographs and goodies and all sorts of fun things for a wall calendar that has the monthly calendar pages and a great photo every month. I will say that one thing that I love about the community of people that we've put ourselves around, I mean, obviously, I wouldn't know who Kathy Campbell is, had I not been in the community. So I think that productivity and technology nerd community that got me my co-host, which is awesome. Woo, friends. But even then, I ran into problems with my notebook. They changed the paper on me and I was skeptical to try it, but I went with a subtle notebook from our pod boss emeritus, Mike Hurley. And it's not even a promotion of the product. It is a promotion of the attention and care that is given to the products that we choose. And for those that don't know much about the Hobanichi cousin that Kathy uses, Hobanichi is like the brand. It is like the bee's knees when it comes to notebooks and planners and systems. When I saw Hobanichi, I was like, ooh, Kathy's a serious productivity person. I'm using my blank pages over here. Kathy's got them numbered down to the day with the moon phases on them. I'm like, that's amazing. But we do provide an amount of care into the choices that we make. And I don't think that there is ever a choice that you can think long and hard about and say, I think this is the tool for me. If you've come up with that decision, whatever the reasons being, whether it's your friends made it, and that means you can ask them a thousand questions when you have them, or it serves the purpose that you have for what you're working on, I think that's totally valid and super cool. But I also have to think that the people that really love this space, that do it professionally, I love them and I think that they're amazing people and I'm glad that they do it so that I get to nerd out on all of their products. But also I get to do the things that I enjoy doing, like going on podcasts and live streams and I don't have to worry about whether or not my pen is going to skip on the paper that I chose because of those little things. Yeah, I think it's so important to not necessarily like, oh, I need to love the people that make the products that I love. Because unlike Jay, I don't know the Hobonichi people. I don't know them either. I just know they're famous. I've never visited their factory. Well, yeah, you know Mike though, with your product. So I love what I have because it has the dates automatically. I tried the whole process with having a Leuchtturm 1917 or whatever year it is and I definitely did not pronounce it properly and doing the full on bullet journal method in a notebook with all of the tracking and things. I've done that before but I started getting overwhelmed with all of the beautiful pieces that people were creating and managing and I would put the date but then get overwhelmed with, oh, I didn't write the month pretty enough or I put the wrong date and now the page is ruined type of stuff. I found and discovered that my anxiety around that was not worth the flexibility involved with that type of a notebook. So when I found the Hobonichi, I was like, oh, this is built in. All of the pieces that I need to put down are already there. I know the date that it needs to do. I know the month, et cetera. I can easily find something if I need to but it doesn't need to be found. It's pretty much when I'm done with the day, I'm done with the day and I don't need to look at it again. I don't scan it. I don't take photos of it. I don't track it in any way other than it just lives in the notebook. So if for some reason I needed to know what I got done on, I don't know, I'm trying to think of a scenario where I would need to go back and look and see what I did on July 13th, 2021 but I can't think of something unless I'm a suspect in a murder. I've been watching way too much Bones, clearly. Burn the books. Burn the books. Burn the books. Quick. I should put that at the end of my life. If I'm no longer around, please burn my books. Jared Ranere I love that you gave space there for people that don't need that insane level of collection and retention but that also means that there's space for people who do. I've had bosses that kept 15 years worth of email which blows my mind but then every now and then there will be something like, oh yeah, we had an agreement with someone seven years ago. Does anyone have what that template looked like? We could all just look at it like, well, I mean, you've kept every email since the first one so you would have it. Then sure enough, they could find it and it's there. That's something that they put value and pride into that they can do that and there's nothing wrong with that. But something that I think that we can put pride and value into are our connections for the next episode. I want to go first because I have one. I snipe yours last week. Jared Ranere Yes, I'm terrified you're going to steal it. This kind of came out of my witty name change for my system but also something that you said at the beginning was that you have a wonderful message on your notebooks that makes you laugh every time you see it even though you're not allowed to say it on our wonderful network. I think I'm going to do something similar. I don't tend to go into the designing space on my notebooks because like you, I will depress myself and say, oh, I didn't write the day or the week in the prettiest of methods. I'm going to write in a minimal way some message that just makes me laugh every time I look at my notebook and invites me to use it. I love that. I think that is a great idea. I can't wait to see, no pressure, but I can't wait to see what your message is and how it brings some joy into your Fortnite. Jared Ranere Yep. So people be expecting a tweet with the hashtag my conduit with an image of some silly message. I might be able to say it on the network. I might not. I don't know yet. It's just got to make me laugh. And if it doesn't make you laugh, that's fine because you're not me. Kite Yeah, but I think that's a great second connection to do because it is very personal and will be the perfect way to finish out this first episode. Mine is going to be a little bit more tangible, I think. I am currently sitting in what someone might look at and call a pig pen. I have so many papers that I need to shred, like so much mail. I have things I need to recycle. I have plants that are dead or dying. My desk is a disaster. Jared Ranere The plants are dead. Burn the books. Oh, sorry. Wrong. Kite And I think what I need is a connection that will allow me to have the clean space that I do enjoy. The freshness of my desk that allows me to concentrate and focus on what I'm looking at, not what I keep thinking I should be doing. And to be completely transparent and obvious when we are done recording, I will take a photo to be included in the show notes of my desk as it is currently. Jared Ranere And I will not because I'm embarrassed of how much of a mess my desk is. Kite Well, you may be surprised and be more willing to share the desk because it's a disaster where I am currently. And so I'm not going to do any cleanup. Before, I'm going to share and post it as a solidarity. Stand with me, all of you messies out there. And I am going to clean my desk and sort it. And my goal is to do a little bit of cleaning at the end of the day. When I am closing up and ending my day of work, I'm going to do the pickup that will not take very long. It'll take a minute, maybe two to put everything back where it needs to belong. And that is my connection for this next period of time. Jared Ranere So Kathy's connection is hashtag cleanliness is next to connectedness. And mine might just be an excuse to say hashtag bless this mess. But we want to know what your connection is. And if you have something that you've thought about while you were listening to this that you think you want to try to do in the next couple of weeks while you're waiting for your next episode of Conduit, be sure to share it with us using the hashtag myconduit on Twitter or in the Relay FM Switch On Discord. We will be more than happy to be your cheering support and also your communicative support being that, you know, it's always fun to hear how other people are doing based on something that you've said or that either made them really excited or upset and they want to change for the better. But I will always leave whether your connections be faulty or good, that's okay as long as we learn something from them. Exactly. And if you want to come hang out with us in the Relay FM Switch On Discord and use that question mark myconduit in there, go to relay.fm slash conduit and there's a option there to join as a member. We are talking about some fun possible member episodes in the future, but we would love if you could support us and our journey and the show by financially supporting us or just subscribe to the show in your favorite podcatcher of choice, wherever that may be. You know, tweet us, follow us, rate us on iTunes or wait, rate us on Apple Podcasts. That's what it's called now. Just kidding. But not really. We would love to hear back from you.

I am hilarious. S- I love your humor. It's very hearty. Sometimes there's, oh, I couldn't think of a joke with chicken and noodle in it. T- Oh, no, come on. Like, are you noodling around in your little chicken bread a little too hard there? S- I'll have to let it stir a little bit more. Okay. Yeah. Let it really simmer and seep and then it will thicken up and come out solidified. Yeah, I think we're done with the soup ideas. T- So after that's done cooking, I guess the only thing I can leave us with is, Kathy, did we con do it? S- Jay, we con did it.
